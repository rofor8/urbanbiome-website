The SuDS Manual
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Summary
This guidance covers the planning, design, construction and maintenance of Sustainable Drainage
Systems (SuDS) to assist with their effective implementation within both new and existing developments.
It looks at how to maximise amenity and biodiversity benefits, and deliver the key objectives of managing
flood risk and water quality. There is also supporting information covering topics such as materials,
landscape design, maintenance, community engagement and costs and benefits.
The information presented in this publication is a compendium of good practice, based on existing
guidance and research both in the UK and internationally, and the practical experience of the authors,
project steering group and industry.
This guidance provides the framework for designing SuDS with confidence and to maximise benefits. Its
contents are relevant for a wide-range of professions and roles and it highlights that through engagement
and collaboration SuDS can be integrated into the design of urban areas, to create high quality places for
future generations.
The key message is that SuDS should be designed to maximise the opportunities and benefits that can
be secured from surface water management.

CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Foreword
When the first SuDS Manual was published in 2007, SuDS was still in its infancy in the UK. Technical
advice on design and construction was sparse and spread across many separate publications. For the
first time the original SuDS Manual placed this information in one place, making it a valuable resource
for anyone engaged in SuDS delivery. Yet for guidance and examples we still had to rely a great deal on
schemes from other countries where the implementation of SuDS was far more advanced. Since that
time SuDS implementation has moved on a great deal in the UK. There are now plenty of examples from
all the UK nations that demonstrate the benefits to be gained from SuDS and these offer reliable and
detailed recommendations for their planning, design, construction, maintenance and operation. The world
of SuDS has indeed moved on. So it is timely that a new edition of the SuDS Manual is now available. Not
only does this new edition update the extensive technical information, it includes new guidance on SuDS
components and the delivery of SuDS in a variety of situations.
It should be clear from the engaging examples in this Manual that SuDS provide real benefits to society
and to the environment, moving surface water from a problem to a valuable resource. For the first time
the guidance includes how to plan for and manage extreme rain events so that communities can be more
resilient to flooding. There are some excellent examples that demonstrate how good design can deliver
far more appealing places in which to live and work, and this, in time, should lead to properties that have
improved value and are easier to insure. Provided that drainage is considered early enough in the outline
design of a new development then there is no reason why SuDS should not become the norm everywhere.
The Manual is primarily aimed at UK applications, though it will be of interest to all engaged in drainage
work globally. It recognises the need for better information and engagement for those involved in the
development process, from planners, landscape architects, designers, engineers, architects and in some
instances the community. It is structured in a way that allows easy access whether it be for high level
appreciation of the concepts only, or for detailed design guidance.
I am grateful to the members of the project steering group who reviewed and contributed to this important
work, and to the energy and effectiveness of the project team. They have delivered a master-piece of
technical guidance that will last for many years. I thoroughly recommend it to you.

Steve is technical director of the Environmental Protection Group Limited. He is a UK registered ground
engineering adviser and has had a wide ranging career in geotechnical and environmental engineering.
Steve has demonstrated that SuDS can be used on any site in the UK to provide cost-effective surface
water drainage systems. Steve also undertakes research and development work that helps to dispel a
lot of the myths that surround the use of SuDS. Most recently Steve has been busy helping landscape
architects successfully design retrofit schemes in a number of different locations.
Helen Udale-Clarke BEng(Hons) MPhil
Helen is a principal engineer at HR Wallingford. She has more than 20 years’ experience in drainage,
flood and climate change risk assessments, with a particular interest in the development of guidance and

Sue is managing director of Illman Young, a landscape architectural practice based in Cheltenham, and
was president of the Landscape Institute from 2012–2014. Sue’s practice works across most planning
and development sectors, but she is probably best known for her advocacy work promoting integrated
water management and SuDS through inter-professional collaboration. The integration of grey, green and
blue in urban landscapes has never been more relevant, and is a subject that Sue continues to promote.
In addition to her current role, she is a champion for flood mitigation and resilience on behalf of the
Construction Industry Council (CIC).
Tamasine Scott MA (Hons) LArch CMLI
Tamasine is a landscape architect and senior associate of Grant Associates. She has led a variety of
large and small projects, from cooled conservatories and university campuses in Singapore to secondary
schools in the UK and urban parks in Spain. SuDS has become second nature in her design process,
integrating the functional requirements of water management within playful and thriving landscapes.
Tamsine is fascinated by using SuDS in the design process to integrate landscape, architecture and
engineering, thereby achieving diverse landscapes that ultimately enrich experience.

Executive summary
WHY SUDS?
Surface water should be managed for maximum benefit, now and in the future. By working
together we can integrate surface water management into the design of our towns and
cities, protecting our environment and creating high quality places for future generations.
Why is managing surface water runoff so important?
When rain falls on a natural landscape, it soaks into the ground (infiltration), evaporates,
is taken up by plants (evapotranspiration) and some of it eventually finds its way into
streams and rivers.
These stages of the water cycle can be impeded when land is altered by development.
In urban areas, there tends to be less permeable ground available for infiltration and
less vegetation for evapotranspiration. When rain falls on impermeable surfaces, much
more of it turns into surface water runoff, which can cause flooding, pollution and
erosion problems.
Research shows that, if we don’t change the way that we design our urban areas and
manage surface water runoff more effectively, these problems are going to get worse.
Climate change projections show it is likely that heavy rainfall and flooding will become
more frequent. Continuing to provide new sewer capacity to cope with these growing
risks is unaffordable.
Climate change projections also suggest that water shortages will become more
frequent, especially in the south-east of England where demand is rising due to a
growing population. This will increase pressure on our existing water supplies and
we will need to find ways to be more efficient and creative in capturing and using the
rainwater that falls on our urban areas.
As well as contributing to more surface water runoff, increasing urbanisation has also
reduced wildlife in urban areas. Where green spaces exist, these are often isolated
from each other, which means that wildlife habitats become fragmented, preventing
some species from being able to move between them. Eventually this leads to some
species being lost from our green spaces, to the detriment of the local ecosystem and
the human population.

What are SuDS?
Sustainable drainage systems (SuDS) are designed to maximise the opportunities and benefits we can
secure from surface water management.
There are four main categories of benefits that can be achieved by SuDS water quantity, water quality,
amenity and biodiversity. These are referred to as the four pillars of SuDS design.
SuDS can take many forms, both above and below ground. Some types of SuDS include planting, others
include proprietary/manufactured products. In general terms, SuDS that are designed to manage and use
rainwater close to where it falls, on the surface and incorporating vegetation, tend to provide the greatest
benefits. Most SuDS schemes use a combination of SuDS components to achieve the overall design
objectives for the site.

CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Some examples of SuDS:
Rainwater harvesting systems can collect rainwater from roofs and other paved surfaces for use
on site.
Green roofs, where a planted soil layer is constructed on a roof to create a living surface, can reduce
surface runoff.
Pervious pavements provide a hard surface that can be used for pedestrians or vehicles, while
allowing rainwater to pass through to the soil or underground storage.
Bioretention systems (including rain gardens) collect runoff, allowing it to pond temporarily on the
surface before filtering through vegetation and underlying soils.
Trees capture rainwater and provide evapotranspiration, biodiversity and shade.
Swales, detention basins, ponds and wetlands slow the flow of water, store and treat runoff while
draining it through the site and encouraging biodiversity.
Soakaways and infiltration basins promote infiltration as an effective means of controlling runoff and
supporting groundwater recharge.
What are the benefits of SuDS?
SuDS deliver high quality drainage while supporting urban areas to cope better with severe rainfall
both now and in the future. SuDS also help counteract some of the impacts on our water cycle
caused by increased urbanisation, such as reduced infiltration which in turn can result in diminished
groundwater supplies.
SuDS can improve the quality of life in developments and urban spaces by making them more vibrant,
visually attractive, sustainable and more resilient to change, by improving urban air quality, regulating
building temperatures, reducing noise and delivering recreation and education opportunities. High quality
SuDS designs that are integrated into the overall design of the development can attract tourism and
investment, driving economic growth for the local area.
Where SuDS are designed to make efficient use of the space available, they can often cost less to
implement than underground piped systems.
Where can you use SuDS?
SuDS can be used anywhere. SuDS can be used for new developments and redevelopments, and can be
retrofitted into existing developments.
SuDS can be used in even the smallest spaces. Good SuDS design maximises the use of the available
space by delivering efficient drainage together with other functions to help meet the objectives of the site.
For example
pervious pavements can be used for parking
rain gardens can be incorporated into traffic calming measures
detention basins can also have recreational uses
trees and green roofs can help to regulate building temperatures.
Most sites pose challenges of one sort or another, but the range of SuDS components and solutions
available means that, with the timely engagement of the right expertise, effective SuDS schemes can be
delivered for all developments. This includes:
high density development sites
steeply sloping sites

flat sites
sites with high groundwater levels
sites within floodplains
contaminated land sites
sites with low infiltration capacity
sites with unstable soils.
The three keys to successful SuDS implementation
Consider how surface water runoff will be managed on your site from the start, and make it an
integral part of the design process.
Put the right team together early in the process, so that urban planning, landscape architecture,
architecture, drainage design and environmental aspects can be considered collectively.
Consult with relevant stakeholders early in the process, including the local planning authority,
environmental regulator and those with responsibility for approving and maintaining the SuDS.
How do you design SuDS?
SuDS design should follow the guidance provided in the SuDS Manual, with due regard for any national
or local regulatory requirements.
SuDS design should, as much as possible, be based around the following
using surface water runoff as a resource
managing rainwater close to where it falls
managing runoff on the surface
allowing rainwater to soak into the ground
promoting evapotranspiration
slowing and storing runoff to mimic natural runoff characteristics
reducing contamination of runoff through pollution prevention and controlling the runoff at source
treating runoff to reduce the risk of urban contaminants causing environmental pollution.

Introduction to the SuDS
Manual
SCOPE OF GUIDANCE
This guidance covers the planning, design, construction and maintenance of
sustainable drainage systems (SuDS) to assist with their effective implementation within
both new and existing developments. The guidance looks at how to maximise amenity
and biodiversity benefits, and deliver the key objectives of managing flood risk and
water quality. There is also supporting information covering topics such as materials,
landscape design, community engagement and costs and benefits.
The guidance presented in this publication is a compendium of good practice, based
on existing guidance and research in the UK and internationally and the practical
experience of the authors, the project steering group and industry.
As experience of SuDS implementation and long-term maintenance continues to
increase across the UK, lessons will continue to be learned. Also, continuing research
on SuDS performance, both in the UK and internationally, will influence how design
practice evolves. This guidance, however, provides a framework for designing SuDS
with confidence and to maximise benefits.
The guidance is relevant for a wide range of professions and roles, including (in no
particular order)
drainage and flood risk management engineers
architects and landscape architects
planners and urban designers
site owners and developers
planning and drainage approval bodies
environmental regulators
ecologists
highways and road authorities
sewerage undertakers
drainage and landscape contractors
proprietary drainage and other product manufacturers.
This manual is divided into five sections and is colour coded based on these sections.
It starts with a high-level overview and progresses into more detailed guidance in the
later sections. The sections have different intended audiences, so the level of technical
understanding expected of the reader increases through the manual.
Part A Introduction to the SuDS Manual

CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Readers new to SuDS should focus initially on Parts A to C, before referring to Parts D and E for
further information.
Readers familiar with SuDS are still advised to read all sections at least once, rather than just relying on
Parts D and E to provide the guidance needed for detailed design. This is because the concepts covered
in Parts D and E are introduced in Parts B and C, and it is important to understand the underpinning
philosophy and approach.
The appendices provide detailed frameworks and checklists covering health and safety, design and
construction. There is also a design example (Appendix C), which presents a hypothetical development
site, to demonstrate the design process and the detailed design of individual SuDS components.

Relationship to other guidance
This publication replaces the original SuDS Manual (Woods Ballard et al, 2007).
This document does not include detailed information on planning requirements, SuDS approval and adoption
processes or standards. These vary depending on region and should always be sourced and referred to early
in the design process. National or (where appropriately adopted) local requirements may take precedence
over the guidance set out in this manual, and this should be checked with the relevant planning, approving and
maintenance bodies.
Also, this document does not cover in detail the specific technical challenges and planning issues
associated with replacing piped drainage systems with SuDS at existing development sites (retrofitting).
However, the design of retrofit SuDS should follow the same overall approach. Guidance specifically
related to retrofitting can be found in Digman et al (2012).
SuDS is a key part of water sensitive urban design (WSUD), integrating the management of surface water
runoff into the urban form (Abbott et al, 201). However, WSUD has a broader consideration of the whole
water cycle (ie including wastewater and water supply) and of the wider integration of development with
watercourses and flood pathways, as part of an overall strategy within planning and urban design. In all
other aspects, the aspirations and objectives are the same.

01Chapter
The philosophy of SuDS
his chapter discusses how SuS can deliver multiple benefits the
importance of managing surface water runoff in a sustainable way and
what makes a drainage system sustainable.
Chapters 2–10 provide further details of the concepts introduced here.
1.1 DELIVERING MULTIPLE BENEFITS
Sustainabe drainae sstems SuDS an deier mutie benefits
Surface water is a valuable resource and this should be reflected in the way it is
managed and used in the built environment. It can add to and enhance biodiversity,
beauty, tranquillity and the natural aesthetic of buildings, places and landscapes and it
can help make them more resilient to the changing climate.
The philosophy of sustainable drainage systems is about maximising the benefits and
minimising the negative impacts of surface water runoff from developed areas.
The SuDS approach involves slowing down and reducing the quantity of surface water
runoff from a developed area to manage downstream flood risk, and reducing the risk of
that runoff causing pollution. This is achieved by harvesting, infiltrating, slowing, storing,
conveying and treating runoff on site and, where possible, on the surface rather than
underground. Water then becomes a much more visible and tangible part of the built
environment, which can be enjoyed by everyone.
By adopting this approach, SuDS have the opportunity to deliver and enhance the green
space within developments and link to wider green networks, supporting the provision of
habitats and places for wildlife to live and flourish. The benefits to the community of using
SuDS are also numerous, including improvements in health, wellbeing and quality of life
(liveability) for both individuals and communities, which in turn can increase the value of
property and the prosperity of the local economy (Box 1.1).
To maximise these benefits, surface water management should be considered from the
beginning of the development planning process and throughout influencing site layout
and design, and the use and characteristics of urban spaces (see Case study 1.1). So it is
important that, where appropriate, an interdisciplinary team (including planners, landscape
architects, architects and drainage engineers) should work together from the outset.
There are many different ways that SuDS can be applied to deliver effective surface
water management that are both value for money and inspirational. Depending on
the opportunities and constraints of the site, the type of development planned and
the characteristics of the surrounding area, this can be through a combination of
components open water, vegetated and hard landscaped, above and below ground.
SuDS can be used in even the smallest spaces the apparent lack of space should never be
a reason for not using SuDS. Designing SuDS so that the space performs multiple functions
is particularly important in dense urban areas where space is at a premium (Box 1.2).
This manual provides guidance for designers to enable them to make informed choices
that suit their specific circumstances and maximise opportunities at reasonable cost.

1.1
Benefits of SuDS
protecting people and property from increased flood risk resulting from the development
protecting the quality of groundwater and surface waters from polluted runoff from the development
protecting natural flow regimes (and thus the morphology and associated ecology) in rivers,
lakes and streams
supporting local natural habitats and associated ecosystems by encouraging greater
biodiversity and linking habitats
improving soil moisture and replenishing depleted groundwater levels
providing society with a valuable supply of water
creating attractive places where people want to live, work and play through the integration of
water and green spaces with the built environment
improving people’s understanding of how runoff from their development is being managed and
used, and the benefits of more sustainable approaches
supporting the creation of developments that are more able to cope with changes in climate
delivering cost-effective infrastructure that uses fewer natural resources and has a smaller
whole-life carbon footprint than conventional drainage.

The Circle is an award winning multi-functional public space located in a roundabout, providing green
space that hosts many community events, including farmers markets, blues festivals and arts festivals
(as shown in Figure 1.1). It collects runoff from surrounding streets to alleviate downstream flooding,
infiltrates, stores and treats the runoff, re-circulates the water into a public fountain that provides
cooling for the area and the space even abates surrounding vehicle noise.

1.2
The SuDS approach to managing surface water runoff
SuDS design should be based on the following, as much as possible, in order to maximise benefits
use surface water runoff as a resource
manage rainwater close to where it falls (at source)
manage runoff on the surface (above ground)
allow rainwater to soak into the ground (infiltration)
promote evapotranspiration
slow and store runoff to mimic natural runoff rates and volumes
reduce contamination of runoff through pollution prevention and by controlling the runoff at source
treat runoff to reduce the risk of urban contaminants causing environmental pollution.
Depending on the characteristics of the site and local requirements, these may be used in
combination and to varying degrees.
1.2 MANAGING SURFACE WATER RUNOFF
SuDS aim to mimic natural hydrological processes
The SuDS approach uses natural hydrology as the baseline against which system performance is evaluated.
Urbanisation alters the natural landscape and affects catchment hydrological processes. The natural
water cycle maintains a balance of water circulation through evaporation, precipitation, infiltration/
groundwater recharge and absorption and transpiration by plants. Urbanisation reduces the permeability
of the land, replacing free draining ground with impermeable surfaces, such as roofs, roads, parking and
other hard-scaping. Development often removes the natural vegetation that intercepts, slows and returns
rainfall to the air, reduces the amount of water that can infiltrate into the ground, and this can significantly
increase the rate at which water runs off the surface.
Figure 1.2 illustrates the impacts of urbanisation on a catchment by reducing its permeability and
increasing surface water runoff.
The traditional method of draining surface water runoff from built-up areas, through underground pipe
and tank storage systems, was intended to protect public health and prevent local flooding by taking
the water away from source as quickly as possible. In many UK towns and cities, surface water runoff
drains to a combined sewer where it mixes with sewage. In such systems, this can place a significant
and unpredictable burden on wastewater treatment works, triggering some of the untreated sewage to
spill into receiving watercourses via combined sewer overflows (CSOs). Flooding (contaminated with
sewage) can also occur from surcharged manholes. In more recent developments, separate sewerage
networks have generally been provided for the foul and the surface water systems. The foul water is
piped to the wastewater treatment works, while the surface water is piped to the nearest watercourse.
These separate surface water sewers reduce the risk of CSO spills, but still transfer the pollutants
present in urban runoff (including potential misconnections) from the urban surface directly to receiving
waters. Although attenuation tanks and flow controls may sometimes be used to control increased peak
flow rates, changes in discharge frequencies and volumes are generally not addressed, and these can
lead to physical impacts such as erosion and disturbance to habitats and ecosystems.
In the natural landscape, habitats such as peat bogs and heather moorland, broadleaved woodland,
wildflower meadows and reed beds all serve as natural sponges, soaking up rainfall and filtering
out contaminants. In developed areas, well-designed SuDS landscapes can offer some of the same
opportunities by incorporating drainage elements such as green roofs, bioretention systems, wetlands
and ponds that use the same natural processes (Figure 1.3).

Figure 1. SuDS using natural processes
SuDS are especially effective at restoring soil moisture and water balance, together with natural base
flows. SuDS aim to restore or preserve the ecologically important elements of the pre-development runoff
processes for a range of flow conditions from small to large rainfall events.
As surface water runoff washes over a developed catchment surface, it mobilises sediment, litter and
a wide range of pollutants related to human activities (such as oils, grits, metals, fertilisers, pesticides,
animal wastes, salts and pathogens). Without intervention, these eventually flow into rivers, groundwater
and the sea, posing a risk to the environment and public health. As the pollution is widespread and
comes from many types of sources and locations, it is known as diffuse pollution and although individual
sources may not pose a threat, collectively they can potentially lead to significant impacts on groundwater
or surface waters.
SuDS provide an opportunity to capture and treat runoff by intercepting, filtering and degrading pollutants,
and by reducing the volume of potentially contaminated runoff.
Surface based SuDS components enable
z the use of natural treatment processes associated with vegetation and the action of sunlight
z easy identification of sources of contamination, both acute (eg accidental spills) and chronic (long-
term, ongoing pollution, including misconnections)
z cost-effective removal of trapped pollutant loads before they reach receiving waters
z cost-effective system remedial works.

CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
1.3 DELIVERING RESILIENCE
SuDS can cope well with severe rainfall, climate change and increasing urbanisation
There is strong evidence that the earth’s climate is changing because of human activity and that it will
continue to change over the coming century, whether or not emissions of greenhouse gases are cut
dramatically. Climate projections for the UK suggest that winters may become milder and wetter and
summers may become warmer, particularly in the south-east. Some types of extreme events may
become more frequent, such as heat waves, droughts and flooding, but due to the natural variability in the
earth’s weather and limitations with climate modelling, this is currently less certain.
Wetter winters and potentially more frequent and higher intensity rainfall events (in summer as well as
winter) are expected to increase runoff from urban and agricultural land. This in turn would increase
the risk of flooding, discharges from CSOs, diffuse pollution and soil erosion, with potentially negative
impacts for the natural environment as well as the human population.
These impacts could also be exacerbated by increased runoff from urban intensification/urban creep
increasing density of development which increases the impermeability of developed areas, causing rates
and volumes of runoff to rise, such as paving over gardens, extending buildings or adding roads.
SuDS offer a robust approach to managing rainfall events that exceed design conditions rainfall more
severe than allowed for in the system design. In surface based systems, water levels rise gradually and
visibly during large rainfall events. With SuDS, excess runoff can be readily conveyed from within the
drainage system into defined safe exceedance conveyance pathways and storage ones. This enables
communities to understand and prepare for flooding more effectively than when served by subsurface
systems, where flooding can occur suddenly, when the design capacity is exceeded.
SuDS also offer a more adaptable way of draining surfaces under the threat of both climate change and
urban intensification. This is because surface based systems can be designed to offer more flexible
capacity, and they tend to have greater potential for enhancement in the future at a reasonable cost
compared to subsurface systems.
Water availability in the summer is expected to decrease, the consequences of which are likely to be
exacerbated by higher temperatures. For example, lower flows in rivers in the summer months would
lead to reduced dilution of pollutants in runoff when summer rainfall events do occur. There may also be
more frequent algal blooms and eutrophication. At the same time, population growth and higher summer
temperatures are likely to lead to greater demand for water. The competing pressures of maintaining
public water supply without causing environmental damage need to be managed sustainably. SuDS can
help by supplementing water supplies through rainwater harvesting and reducing pollutant discharges into
receiving waters.
As well as these impacts on water systems, climate change is also likely to affect many aspects of urban
living, especially human health. Elevated summer temperatures, for example, have been shown to cause
additional deaths especially in cities. SuDS in various forms can help to provide urban cooling (Figure 1.4).
Hard surfaces tend to heat up in high temperatures, but this can be counteracted by providing SuDS with
permanent water and/or vegetation. For example, green roofs can help to insulate buildings, green walls
and vertical gardens can support natural ventilation (see Case study 1.2), trees provide shade, and water
features cool the air.

1.4 MAKING DEVELOPMENTS MORE SUSTAINABLE
SuDS make developments more sustainable
Sustainable development aims to ensure a better quality of life, now and for generations to come. In the
UK, this means meeting the following objectives (adapted from HM Government, 2005)
1 social progress that recognises the needs of everyone.
2 effective protection of the natural environment and processes.
the sustainable use of natural resources.
the maintenance of strong and stable levels of economic growth and employment.
Using SuDS for the sustainable management of surface water runoff can support
z the management of flood risk through the control of both flow rates and volumes
z the preservation and support of habitats and biodiversity through the control of flows (and
contaminants) to protect ecology and morphology
z the creation of sustainable habitats through the use of vegetated SuDS
z the prudent use of water resources through the implementation of rainwater harvesting systems
z the preservation of water resources through the protection of ground and surface water quality
z the sustainable use of natural resources through the minimisation of their use in SuDS design
z the reduction of embodied and operational carbon in drainage systems within manufacture and
through the reduced use of pumping.
By taking advantage of natural systems and natural materials, most SuDS use fewer resources and less
energy (leading to lower greenhouse gas emissions) than traditional drainage systems and, by using
vegetation, can act as carbon sinks when in use.
Spatial planning and, in particular, local development planning policies and strategies are the most
important instruments for promoting and delivering sustainable development in the UK. Taking a holistic
and integrated approach to surface water management through the implementation of SuDS, improves
water management and environmental protection at the strategic level (eg by contributing to green
infrastructure), and contributes to local biodiversity and amenity objectives.
1.5 COMPLYING WITH LEGISLATION AND REGULATIONS
SuDS help deliver compliance with legislation and regulations
There are a great number of legal and other instruments that relate to the management of runoff and
surface water. The European Union Water Framework Directive (European Commission, 2000) was
transposed into UK national legislation in December 200. This Directive takes account of all the different
objectives for which the aquatic environment is protected (ecology, drinking water, health and particular
habitats), and ensures that measures taken to achieve the objectives are co-ordinated properly.
The Water Framework Directive encourages a more sustainable approach to drainage by
z establishing a holistic approach to managing the water environment, based on river basins,
integrating water quantity with water quality considerations
z establishing quality objectives for all receiving waters, in order to achieve good status
z establishing a quality classification system for surface water that includes chemical,
hydromorphological and ecological parameters
26 Part B: Philosophy and approach
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
z establishing a quality classification system for groundwater status and a requirement for the quality of
groundwater not to result in any significant damage to terrestrial ecosystems
z establishing controls in relation to pollution of receiving waters from point and diffuse sources
z preventing deterioration in the status of receiving waters
z promoting sustainable water use based on long-term protection of water resources
z achieving environmental objectives in a cost-effective way.
Measures to prevent or control diffuse sources of pollution is a basic requirement of the Directive (Article
11 (h)). This means that all discharges of urban runoff have to be managed such that their impact on
the receiving environment is mitigated. This effectively precludes the use of the traditional approach to
drainage unless special controls are used to slow down flows and treat the runoff. SuDS provide a means
of addressing many of the requirements above.
SuDS also provide the means to simultaneously support the delivery of a broad range of national and
European requirements and strategies including those relating to:
z flood risk management
z water resource management
z climate change resilience
z green infrastructure
z wetland creation
z biodiversity and wildlife, and
z carbon reduction.
In particular, there are national and local flood risk regulations and guidance that encourage the better
management of surface water management, some explicitly promoting the use of SuDS (following on
from the Pitt Review, 200).
National planning policy across the four administrations of the UK require planning authorities to give
priority to SuDS in planning applications.
1.6 THE SUDS DESIGN PHILOSOPHY
SuDS schemes use multiple components working together
SuDS should not be thought of as an individual component (such as a filter strip, swale or detention pond
see Table 1.1), but as an interconnected system designed to manage, treat and make best use of surface
water, from where it falls as rain to the point at which it is discharged into the receiving environment beyond
the boundaries of the site. The approach to SuDS design was summarised in Box 1.2.
A central design concept for SuDS is the SuDS Management Train. This describes the use of a
sequence of components that collectively provide the necessary processes to control the frequency
of runoff, the flow rates and the volumes of runoff, and to reduce concentrations of contaminants to
acceptable levels. There are six specific functions provided by SuDS components. These are not
independent, and one component may provide two or more functions. These are summarised in Box 1.3.

Functions of SuDS components
Rainwater harvesting systems components that capture rainwater and facilitate its use within
the building or local environment.
Pervious surfacing systems structural surfaces that allow water to penetrate, thus reducing the
proportion of runoff that is conveyed to the drainage system, eg green roofs, pervious paving. Many
of these systems also include some subsurface storage and treatment.
Infiltration systems components that facilitate the infiltration of water into the ground. These often
include temporary storage ones to accommodate runoff volumes before slow release to the soil.
Conveyance systems components that convey flows to downstream storage systems. Where
possible, these systems also provide flow and volume control and treatment, eg swales.
Storage systems components that control the flows and, where possible, volumes of runoff being
discharged from the site, by storing water and releasing it slowly (attenuation). These systems may
also provide further treatment of the runoff, eg ponds, wetlands and detention basins.
Treatment systems components that remove or facilitate the degradation of contaminants
present in the runoff.
There are many types of SuDS component, which means that sustainable drainage can be delivered
anywhere. The designer can choose a number of different SuDS components and tailor the overall
composition of a SuDS scheme to the local context (Figure 1.6). The designer can use the Management
Train to create green corridors, link habitats together and add fun, education and amenity value. A
summary of the types of SuDS component available to the designer is provided in Table 1.1. Detailed
descriptions of these components are provided in Chapters 11–23.
Wherever possible, runoff should be managed at source (ie close to where the rain falls) with residual
flows then conveyed downstream to further storage or treatment components, where required. The
passage of water between individual components of the Management Train should be, wherever possible,
through the use of above-ground conveyance systems (eg swales and rills) although pipework and
subsurface proprietary products may prove more efficient for specific schemes, especially where space
is limited such as in a redevelopment. Pre-treatment (the removal of litter and sediment) and maintenance
are vital to ensure the long-term and sustained effectiveness of all SuDS components. Overland flow
routes will also be required to convey and control floodwater safely during extreme events (Section 1.3).

Rainwater
harvesting
systems
Rainwater is collected from the roof of a building or from other paved surfaces in
an over-ground or underground tank for use on site. Depending on its intended
use, the system may include treatment elements. The system should include
specific storage provision if it is to be used to manage runoff to a design standard.
Chapter 11
Green roofs
A planted soil layer is constructed on the roof of a building to create a living
surface. Water is stored in the soil layer and absorbed by vegetation. Blue roofs
store water at roof level, without the use of vegetation.
Chapter 12
Infiltration
systems
These systems collect and store runoff allowing it to infiltrate into the ground.
Overlying vegetation and underlying unsaturated soils can offer protection to
groundwater from pollution risks.
Chapter 13
Proprietary
treatment
systems
These subsurface and surface structures are designed to provide treatment of
water through the removal of contaminants. Chapter 14
Filter strips Runoff from an impermeable area is allowed to flow across a grassed or
otherwise densely planted area to promote sedimentation and filtration. Chapter 15
Filter drains Runoff is temporarily stored below the surface in a shallow trench filled with
stone/gravel, providing attenuation, conveyance and treatment (via filtration). Chapter 16
Swales
A vegetated channel is used to convey and treat runoff (via filtration). These
can be wet, where water is designed to remain permanently at the base of the
swale, or dry where water is only present in the channel after rainfall events. It
can be lined, or unlined to allow infiltration.
Chapter 17
Bioretention
systems
A shallow landscaped depression allows runoff to pond temporarily on the
surface, before filtering through vegetation and underlying soils prior to
collection or infiltration. In its simplest form it is often referred to as a rain garden.
Engineered soils (gravel and sand layers) and enhanced vegetation can be used
to improve treatment performance.
Chapter 18
Trees
Trees can be planted within a range of infiltration SuDS components to improve
their performance, as root growth and decomposition increase soil infiltration
capacity. Alternatively they can be used as standalone features within soil-
filled tree pits, tree planters or structural soils, collecting and storing runoff and
providing treatment (via filtration and phytoremediation).
Chapter 19
Pervious
pavements
Runoff is allowed to soak through structural paving. This can be paving blocks
with gaps between solid blocks, or porous paving where water filters through
the block itself. Water can be stored in the sub-base and potentially allowed to
infiltrate into the ground.
Chapter 20
Attenuation
storage tanks
Large, below-ground voided spaces can be used to temporarily store runoff
before infiltration, controlled release or use. The storage structure is often
constructed using geocellular or other modular storage systems, concrete tanks
or oversied pipes.
Chapter 21
Detention
basins
During a rainfall event, runoff drains to a landscaped depression with an outlet that
restricts flows, so that the basin fills and provides attenuation. Generally, basins
are dry, except during and immediately following the rainfall event. If vegetated,
runoff will be treated as it is conveyed and filtered across the base of the basin.
Chapter 22
Ponds and
wetlands
Features with a permanent pool of water can be used to provide both attenuation
and treatment of runoff, where outflows are controlled and water levels
are allowed to increase following rainfall. They can support emergent and
submerged vegetation along their shoreline and in shallow, marshy ones, which
enhances treatment processes and biodiversity.

Introducing the SuDS
design approach
This chapter introduces the overarching principle of SuDS design; the
four broad objectives related to water quantity, water quality, amenity
and biodiversity; and the design criteria that should be followed to deliver
these objectives.
This chapter should be read alongside Chapters 3–6, which describe the design
criteria in more detail, accompanied by good practice design standards.
2.1 THE PRINCIPLE AND OBJECTIVES OF SUDS DESIGN
The overarching principle of SuDS design is that surface water runoff should be
manae for maimum enefit
The types of benefits that can be achieved by SuDS will be dependent on the site, but
fit broadly into four categories water quantity, water quality, amenity and biodiversity.
These are also referred to as the four pillars of SuDS design (Figure 2.1). Each of these
pillars has a design objective, as presented in Figure 2.1.

2.2 SUDS DESIGN CRITERIA
In order to deliver the design objectives of Figure 2.1, there are different aspects of SuDS design that
need to be taken into consideration. These are referred to here as design criteria, and are summarised in
Table 2.1. Chapters 3–6 discuss the four criteria.

Note
Definitions for resilience, flexibility and adaptability can be found in the glossary (Appendix A).
These design criteria can and should be given full consideration for all types of development. The extent
and way in which each criterion can be delivered will depend on site characteristics, development context
and local objectives. The water quantity and water quality criteria are likely to be the main drivers in
determining the design philosophy for a site, and these are supported by standards (expected levels
of service) for the surface water management system. Maximising delivery of amenity and biodiversity
criteria will often deliver on a range of other required planning outcomes/objectives for the site.
The criteria are not independent of each other. For example, a bioretention system draining an area of
urban road may deliver on all of the criteria simultaneously. There are also a number of criteria that are
cross-cutting. For example, using runoff as a resource will support both water quantity and amenity
design objectives.
In order to maximise opportunities and the associated benefits, the criteria should be considered at an early
stage and fully integrated into the surface water management and urban design process (Chapter 7). In so
doing, it is then possible to ensure that the scheme is truly multi-functional and delivers the highest return
for the developer and for the community who will live there. As well as the SuDS design criteria, there
are more generic criteria of good design that are required to ensure a safe, functional and cost-effective
SuDS scheme. These generally fall into the four categories listed in Table 2.2. Further discussion of
these aspects of design can be found in the chapters indicated, although reference to these is also made
throughout the manual.

Health and safety It is safe for those living near or visiting the system, and for those involved in
its operation and maintenance. Chapter 36
2.3 THE ROLE OF THE DESIGNER
The design objectives and criteria presented in Sections 2.1 to 2.3 provide a framework for the designer
to work within, but it remains the responsibility of the designer to choose how to apply these to a specific
scheme. Central to this is the need to engage stakeholders early, including those with responsibility for
approving, adopting or maintaining the SuDS scheme, the environmental regulator, sewerage undertaker
and roads authorities. Opportunities for SuDS will be maximised through collaborative working between
engineers, landscape architects, planners, architects and the local community (Chapter 34).
The design process is about delivering the design criteria in a way that balances and optimises the
benefits versus the costs of alternative options working with the opportunities and constraints of the
site, and with stakeholder and regulatory requirements.
2.4 ASSESSING AND APPROVING SUDS SCHEMES
Although design of high-quality SuDS is as much an art as a science, it is important that a SuDS design
can be assessed, to determine whether it delivers the design criteria adequately.
Indicators these are the means of measuring the extent to which the design criteria are being
achieved. Example indicators are presented in Chapters 3–6. These should be selected and/or amended
to suit the local application.
Standards these are the minimum performance targets or levels of service that SuDS designs should
meet. The standards set out in this manual are standards of good practice. Many of these standards are
also set out in other best practice documents (that have been approved by the environmental regulator),
and/or statutory national standards. Local standards (alongside local guidance) may be set out by Local
Authorities and other approving or adopting bodies, which could take precedence.

Designing for water
quantity
This chapter explains the objective of designing for water quantity and
the design criteria that should be followed to deliver this objective. Good
practice design standards are also presented.
This chapter should be read alongside Chapters 4–6, to understand how the different
SuDS design criteria relate to each other, and Chapter 7 to understand when and how
to apply these criteria.
3.1 WATER QUANTITY DESIGN OBJECTIVE
ontro the uantit of runoff to suort the manaement of ood ris and
maintain and rotet the natura ater e
In order to ensure that the surface water runoff from a developed site does not have a
detrimental impact on people, property and the environment, it is important to control:
z how fast the runoff is discharged from the site (ie the peak runoff rate) and
z how much runoff is discharged from the site (ie the runoff volume).
SuDS that are designed to manage water quantity in this way reduce the likelihood of
flooding caused by the development. They can help protect natural water cycles by
promoting the recharge of soil moisture levels (and subsequent evapotranspiration
processes), by maintaining stream and river baseflows, and by replenishing
groundwater. They can also help reduce the risk of erosion of the banks and riverbed,
caused as a result of the receiving watercourse experiencing more frequent bankfull or
near bankfull conditions. Such erosion increases sediment loads and can degrade the
ecological health of the watercourse.
SuDS are most effective at reducing flood risk for relatively high intensity, short and
medium duration events. So SuDS are particularly important in mitigating potential
increases in surface water flooding, sewer flooding and flooding from small and medium
sized watercourses resulting from development. SuDS tend to have less impact on
flood risk associated with larger rivers that are more sensitive to long duration events
(such as the Thames or the Somerset Levels). However, this does not mean that SuDS
are not required. Local hydraulic constraints and flow characteristics may mean that
flow and volume control are still necessary for managing local flood risk and providing
groundwater recharge, where appropriate. Reducing pollution, together with delivering
amenity and biodiversity benefits for the site are also still very important.
SuDS for a single site could potentially be demonstrated to have limited impact, but it is
the cumulative impact of all development in the catchment (combined with the potential
effects of climate change) that should be taken into consideration.
Wh shoud ea runoff rates be ontroed?
Peak rates of surface water runoff discharged from a developed (ie relatively
impermeable) site, if left uncontrolled, are normally significantly greater than from the
site in its greenfield state. This is because the runoff drains off the surfaces of the
developed site much quicker than the greenfield site and there is much more runoff,
Chapter 3: Designing for water quantity
37
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
as less water is able to penetrate the ground or be intercepted in other ways. On sites overlying sandy,
well-drained soils, peak rates could be at least an order of magnitude higher. This can have significant
consequences for the receiving watercourse by increasing flow velocities and the likelihood of flooding
and bank erosion. Where sites discharge to existing piped drainage systems, the risks tend to be even
greater, as pipes have constrained capacities and are more sensitive to changes in flow rate.
Figure 3.1 shows the pre-development or greenfield discharge rate (green line) compared to the
uncontrolled post-development discharge rate (blue line). The post-development peak is much higher and
arrives much earlier than the pre-development peak.
So the purpose of controlling peak runoff rates is to limit the rate of runoff after development to the rate
that would have occurred before development. This can be achieved by the process of attenuation
slowing and storing runoff on site and then discharging it at a specified maximum rate to the receiving
watercourse (Figure 3.2). This is discussed further in Section 3.1.2.
Figure 3.1 Example of a runoff hydrograph
Figure 3.2 Controlling runoff rates using attenuation storage
38 Part B: Philosophy and approach
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Wh shoud runoff oumes be ontroed?
Attenuation (as discussed in Section 3.1.1) controls the peak runoff rate by extending the hydrograph
(Figure 3.1). So while the peak rate of runoff may not increase, the duration over which this peak rate
occurs will be significantly longer than before development as a result of the additional runoff volume.
This can also increase the likelihood of flooding in the receiving watercourse. Where sites discharge to
sewer systems, changes in volumes are particularly important, due to the risk of sewer flooding and CSO
spills.
Figure 3.1 shows the post-development discharge rate with attenuation in red. The volume of runoff is the
area under the graph. This extended period of peak flows in the receiving watercourse can be damaging
for both morphology and ecology, caused by greater erosion and movement of sediment. Therefore,
controlling peak runoff rates from large storm events is extremely important, but it is not sufficient on its
own to reduce the impact of the development on the downstream catchment.
Also, attenuation can only control relatively large rainfall events, and does nothing to address the
problems associated with a development site generating runoff from all of the smaller rainfall events. With
natural soil conditions, the runoff from the majority of such events (ie with a total depth of, say, 5 mm or
less) would have been lost through infiltration and/or evapotranspiration. Runoff from these frequent small
rainfall events will usually just “pass through” attenuation systems with limited or no control.
At a catchment scale, the potential limitations of using attenuation alone are also evident (Figure 3.3).
Although the runoff from each sub-catchment has been attenuated to limit flows to pre-development
conditions, the peak flow downstream will continue to rise because of the greater total volumes being
discharged from each sub-catchment. This means that the likelihood of flooding downstream still increases.
Figure 3.3 Example of the combined effect of multiple attenuation systems
3.2 WATER QUANTITY DESIGN CRITERIA
3.2.1 Summary
The design criteria presented here should be applied to manage the quantity of water to deliver the
design objective described in Section 3.1. The opportunities for a designer to apply these design criteria
in full will depend on site characteristics, development context and local planning objectives. To maximise
these opportunities, the design criteria should be considered at an early stage of the design process and
fully integrated into that process.
Chapter 3: Designing for water quantity
39
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Managing water quantity can also contribute to the design objectives for water quality, amenity and
biodiversity. So these design criteria should be considered alongside design criteria for water quality,
amenity and biodiversity (Chapter 2, Table 2.1 and Chapters 4–6).
Indicators can be used to evaluate the extent to which design criteria are being delivered by the SuDS
design. Water quantity design criteria and example indicators are presented in Table 3.1.

a suitable time, so that the performance of the system for managing runoff
from subsequent rainfall events is not reduced.
6 Manage on-site flood risk Runoff from rainfall events that exceeds the SuDS capacity is managed in
identified exceedance routes and storage areas.
7 Design in system flexibility/
adaptability to cope with future
change
The SuDS design includes climate change and urban creep allowances, or
is designed with the flexibility (and funding) to be suitably adapted during
its design life.
These design criteria are discussed in more detail in the following subsections. Where minimum
performance targets or specific levels of service should be achieved by a SuDS design, these are
detailed in Section 3.3, and guidance is provided as to how these can be met. These generally
mirror legislative or regulatory standards where they exist. However, local standards, as set out in
supplementary planning documents (SPDs), may take precedence.
Water uantit riterion se surfae ater runoff as a resoure
Using surface water runoff as a resource contributes to the water sensitive urban design (WSUD)
philosophy of integrating water cycle management with the built environment (Morgan et al, 2013).
It is advantageous to design drainage systems that capture and use surface water because this (a) helps
to reduce runoff volumes from the site and (b) allows this valuable resource (water) to be put to good use.
This demonstrates how some amenity benefits are intrinsic in SuDS design.
Rainfall is likely to become an even more valuable resource in the future, as water becomes more scarce,
due to climate change and rising population.
Direct harvesting at or near source for garden watering has been common practice for many years. In
parts of the UK, especially the south-east of England, water resources are increasingly under stress
due to rising demand for water and climate change. In such areas, harvested rainwater is increasingly
being used for other purposes, but it may require treatment where there is a risk of human contact or
consumption. (The level of treatment should be proportionate to the level of risk.) Harvested rainwater
can be used for irrigating landscapes, and roof water can often be used directly for private or communal
40 Part B: Philosophy and approach
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
gardens and allotments, for car washing or for toilet flushing. Rainwater storage systems can be located
in roof voids, beneath gardens, garages, driveways or areas of communal open space, or be part of
boundary walls (Chapter 11).
Using surface water runoff as a resource can provide amenity benefits as well as water quantity benefits.
For example, SuDS can be designed to support areas for water play and urban horticulture, providing
recreational, educational and health and well-being benefits. These are discussed in Chapter 5 under:
Amenity criterion 1: Maximise multi-functionality.
Using SuDS to promote infiltration is another way of protecting water resources, as this can potentially
contribute both to the recharge of aquifers and to interflows through upper soil horions that support
baseflows in local rivers and streams (that may subsequently be abstracted for supply purposes).

To ensure that the site does not have a detrimental impact on the downstream catchment (increasing
flood risk or causing morphological or ecological damage) and protects the natural water cycle, designers
should do each of the following (which are discussed below):
1 Prioritise where surface water runoff is discharged.
2 Control the volume of runoff discharged from the site.
3 Control the peak runoff rates from the site.
Some receiving surface waters, such as estuaries, some large lakes and the sea, are normally not
sensitive to the runoff from developed sites. In these cases, the control of peak runoff rates and runoff
volumes is not necessary. However, even for these scenarios, SuDS are still important, particularly for the
water quality benefits, but also for the amenity and biodiversity value they bring.
rioritise here surfae ater runoff is dishared
The destination for surface water runoff that is not collected for use should be prioritised in the following order
a infiltration
b discharge to surface waters
c discharge to a surface water sewer, highway drain or another drainage system
d discharge to a combined sewer.
Discharge to a foul sewer should not be considered as a possible option.
As much of the runoff as possible (subject to technical or cost constraints) should be discharged to each
destination before a lower priority destination is considered.
Depending on the site characteristics, drainage from different parts of the site could have different
drainage destinations.
Depending on the quantity of runoff and the potential for a particular destination to manage that runoff,
small events might be discharged to a higher level destination, while larger events may need to utilise a
lower priority destination.
Where runoff is to be discharged to a sewerage undertaker’s surface water sewer or combined sewer, the
sewerage undertaker should be consulted as to whether any additional criteria or limiting discharge rates
are required.
Where runoff is to be discharged to a watercourse, the relevant local flood authority should be consulted.

See Section 3.3.1 water quantity standard 1.
ontro ea runoff rates from the site
Peak runoff rates from the site (ie how fast the runoff is allowed to leave the site after development has
taken place) should be controlled by maximising opportunities to capture runoff and slow flow rates
through attenuation and flow controls (eg using swales, detention basins). Providing volumetric control
measures (see above) can reduce the required downstream attenuation storage volumes (Section 3.3.2,
Managing surface water runoff at or close to source helps prevent high rates and volumes of runoff being
conveyed to large downstream attenuation systems.
There may be occasions, possibly in the lower reaches of large river catchments, where rapid discharge
of runoff from the site would be a better strategy for managing flood risk than attenuation and slow
release. If this can be demonstrated by detailed catchment modelling, this may be deemed appropriate
by an approving body. This should be stated in the local flood risk management strategy and/or local
Water uantit riterion resere and rotet natura hdrooia sstems on the site
Natural systems that deliver a specific hydrological function should be preserved and protected where
possible, such as natural wetlands, stream and river corridors, high permeability soil features, areas of high
water table, long-serving agricultural field ditches or ditch systems. Where such systems are dependent on
particular runoff characteristics from the site, this should be taken into account within the SuDS design.
Where possible, clearing/grading/compaction should be limited, as these activities will have a negative
effect on the natural runoff characteristics. Landscape and garden areas that have been compacted
during construction should be returned to pre-construction permeability levels. Steep slopes or areas
of the site with highly erodible soils should also be protected from additional runoff that could further
destabilise material.
Local flood risk management strategies/river basin management plans may have strategic objectives for
the management and/or improvement of local hydrological systems and may set local criteria for drainage
systems that discharge to them.
Additional benefits of preserving natural hydrological systems can include the reduced need for cut and
Water uantit riterion Drain the site effetie
A key requirement of the surface water management system is that it drains the site effectively. It should
be designed with suitable gradients, so that there is a continuous flow of water through the system as
any rainfall event drains through, allowing space for subsequent events to be stored and treated. Shallow
gradients are usually suitable, particularly with surface features, and shallow gradients also help ensure
that natural treatment processes work effectively.
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
The design of the drainage system should take account of the time that it is likely to take for the runoff to
drain through the system. Considerations should include:
1 the impact of potential downstream constraints (eg high water levels in the receiving watercourse) on
the rate and/or duration over which effective drainage can occur
2 the rate at which infiltration is likely to occur, which will determine the time taken for infiltration
storage components to empty for any particular event
3 the hydraulic gradient across the site and the design of storage and conveyance components, which
will determine the time taken for runoff to drain through the SuDS.
Where discharge from the site could be constrained because of high water levels at the outfall from the
site, the likelihood of such water levels coinciding with design events for the drainage system should be
evaluated and accounted for as part of the design process (Chapter 24).
Where any part of the drainage system is at risk of being inundated from external sources during extreme
conditions, the impact of any potential loss of storage (from either inundation or sediment deposition) on
the system performance should be assessed.
The impact of runoff from areas outside the site should be taken into account when siing the drainage
system. Such runoff should be safely routed around or across the site, but will not require additional
control, unless this is part of planning or drainage approval requirements.
Guidance on designing SuDS on sites with steep slopes, with no gradient or very shallow slopes, and on
floodplains is provided in Chapter 8.
Water uantit riterion anae onsite ood ris
The surface water management system should be designed to ensure that the level of flood risk from the
drainage system is acceptable for the site (Section 3.3.3).
All runoff should remain within the designated conveyance and storage areas for the design (standard
of service) event, including an appropriate freeboard allowance. The designated drainage system may
include areas that are only designed to flood on an infrequent basis for example car parks, roads,
recreation areas and such areas will need to be managed with this purpose in mind. For larger events,
the site layout should be designed so that exceedance flows (ie flows that exceed the capacity of the
drainage system) are managed in safe conveyance and storage ones, such that the risk of flooding is
acceptable for all people and property on the site.
SuDS components that are on the surface provide the best means of seeing when water levels are
starting to rise. This enables residents and other users of the site to take action early and effectively. The
change in water level will tend to be gradual, as it moves out of the bank, providing more warning and
reducing the likely severity of the consequences.
Managing the risks associated with external sources of flooding (river, surface water, groundwater etc)
should be dealt with as part of the flood risk mitigation strategy (as defined by the Flood Risk Assessment
or Flood Consequence Assessment). Further details are provided in Chapter 7 . Any additional design
requirements for the SuDS scheme as part of a site flood risk mitigation strategy would be over and
above the requirements described in this manual.

In order that the drainage system will continue to provide effective protection for both the site and
downstream areas, throughout its design life, SuDS should incorporate sufficient capacity and/or be
sufficiently adaptable so as to be resilient to climate change and increases in the level of urbanisation of
the contributing catchment.
Chapter 3: Designing for water quantity
43
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
SuDS components are inherently more adaptable than fixed capacity, subsurface drainage infrastructure.
In some cases where future ownership and investment capacity are assured, drainage systems might be
designed with the flexibility for increasing capacity later in their design life, when climate change risks can
be better quantified or when a higher level of service is required.
Otherwise, up-to-date rainfall intensity uplift factors for individual regions for climate change scenarios
(Section 24.7.1) should be sourced from relevant ministerial or local government guidance, and
incorporated within the design calculations to ensure the design is robust.
Increasing impermeability of the contributing catchment through the design life of the drainage system,
should also be taken into account. Urban creep (ie the addition of patios, conservatories, extensions,
impermeable driveways and other hardstandings) can be significant, particularly in low-to-medium-
density developments, and an appropriate design factor should be agreed with the drainage approving
body before drainage system design (Section 24.7.2).
3.3 WATER QUANTITY DESIGN STANDARDS
The following standards are standards of good practice. Local planning documents, national standards
or other guidance from approving or adopting organisations may take precedence.
The research underpinning the standards on the use of peak flow rates and volume control of discharges
is provided in Kellagher (2002).
BOX
3.1
Return periods, probability of occurrence and critical durations
The return period of a rainfall event is the average time between events of a given or greater
magnitude, usually expressed in years. A 100-year return period event refers to an event that occurs
or is exceeded on average once every hundred years. This can also be expressed as the 1 in 100 or
1:100 year event.
Alternatively, an event can be described as having a probability of occurrence (or frequency of
occurrence), which is 1/return period but often expressed as a percentage. For a 1100 year event,
this would be 1%, ie there is a 1% chance of the event occurring or being exceeded in any one year.
Estimates of return periods are subject to uncertainty, so in reality, consecutive events can occur at
intervals greater or smaller than their average return period. A 1:1 year event refers to an event that
has a 100% chance of occurring in any one year, and thus could be interpreted as a range of events
beneath a certain threshold. However, for the purpose of these standards, when referring to a 11
year event, this should be taken as meaning an event that occurs, on average, once a year.
The critical duration is the duration of rainfall event for a specified return period event (usually
given in hours) that results in the greatest peak flow rate, flood volume or flood level (depending on
the purpose of the analysis) at a particular location. It will be different for different locations on a site.
Water uantit standard ontro of runoff oume
The volume of runoff should be controlled for the following two scenarios
a Volume control for frequent rainfall events
The drainage system should be designed so that runoff from the site to receiving surface waters
does not occur for the majority of small rainfall events.
b Volume control for extreme rainfall events
The drainage system should be designed so that the volume of runoff discharged from the site
during extreme events (normally specified as a 1100 year event) is controlled.
Interpretation of this standard is presented as follows.
44 Part B: Philosophy and approach
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
a oume ontro for freuent rainfa eents
The prevention of runoff from the site for the majority of small (frequent) rainfall events (or for the initial
depth of rainfall for larger events) is called Interception, and Interception of about 5 mm is normally
achievable. From a hydraulic perspective, Interception is required to mimic greenfield hydraulic response
characteristics where small rainfall events do not generally produce any runoff and thus to protect the
morphology and ecology of the receiving watercourse, and the hydrological soil water balances in the
catchment. Interception can be delivered using a variety of methods including rainwater harvesting,
infiltration and evapotranspiration. Interception design methods are set out in Section 24.8.
This standard is the same as water quality standard 1 (Chapter 4). This is because the delivery of
Interception provides both water quantity and water quality benefits. Compliance with this standard is not
usually achievable during periods of wet weather, so a flexible approach is required (eg a requirement to
achieve Interception for a given proportion of events during the summer and a lower proportion during the
winter). In winter or during extended wet periods, the risks to the ecology and morphology of the receiving
watercourse from urban runoff are likely to be lower.
b oume ontro for etreme rainfa eents
Because the volume of runoff from the site can be, in many scenarios, as damaging to downstream flood
risk as peak flow rates (Section .1), it is necessary to ensure that runoff volumes discharged from the
site during extreme events are also controlled.
This means that, where possible, the volume of runoff from the site (or development) area should not
exceed the volume of runoff from the equivalent area in its natural undeveloped or greenfield state (for
the same rainfall event). Methods for estimating greenfield/pre-development runoff volumes are described
in Section 24.4). Where flood risk from the receiving watercourse is particularly high, tighter local
criteria for allowable volumes discharged from the site may need to be specified by the local regulator or
drainage approving body and met by the drainage design.
The use of infiltration and rainwater harvesting are important mechanisms for delivering volume
control the greater the volume of runoff that is infiltrated or used on site, the lower the volume of runoff
discharged. It is important to note that, for clay sites, greenfield runoff volumes will tend to be high
because of the underlying impermeability. So the increase in volume for the developed site will be small.
Where developments take place on more permeable soils, the difference will be far greater, but infiltration
options should be available to assist in managing these larger volumes.
Ideally, the volumetric control of runoff should be demonstrated to meet greenfield runoff behaviour
for all events and particularly those that are relevant for the mitigation of flood risk in the receiving
watercourse. However, this would require the use of time series rainfall as part of a modelling exercise.
Until this approach becomes standard industry practice, a simple method using the 1:100 year, 6 hour
rainfall event can be sufficient for design purposes, as it represents a suitable event for protecting smaller
watercourses that are most at risk from the effects of urban development. As designs for Interception
will help control runoff volumes from smaller events, a single requirement for large events is considered
pragmatic and not overly onerous.
Where controlling runoff to greenfield volumes is considered unachievable, then the runoff volume
should be reduced as much as possible and any additional volume should be stored and released at a
low rate that will not increase downstream flood risk (normally 2 l/s/ha is considered an appropriate rate
(Kellagher, 2002)) using either of the following approaches*:
1 The additional runoff volume (ie the difference between the predicted development runoff volume
and the estimated greenfield runoff volume for the 100 year event, often called Long-Term Storage)
should be discharged from the site at a rate of 2 l/s/ha or less, while still allowing greenfield runoff
peak flow rates to be applied for the greenfield runoff volume.
Note
* The 6 hour event can be used unless more detailed local catchment modelling has been undertaken to justify an alternative duration.
Chapter 3: Designing for water quantity
45
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
2 All the runoff from the site for the 1100 year event should be discharged at either a rate of 2 l/s/ha or
the average annual peak flow rate (ie the mean annual flood, BAR), whichever is the greater.
Approach 2 provides a simpler approach, but results in larger storage volumes being required than Approach 1.
The calculation of the difference in volume between the developed and greenfield scenario (defined as
the Long-Term Storage Volume) is set out in Section 24.10.
For previously developed sites, the surface water management system should be designed so that the
volume of surface water runoff discharged from the site for the 1:100 year, 6 hour event is kept as close
to greenfield conditions as possible. The runoff volume for the pre-development scenario may be very
high and may be contributing to downstream flood risk it should therefore only be allowed for the new
development if the drainage approving body agrees that it is acceptable. Wherever runoff volumes cannot
be sufficiently reduced, they should be discharged from the site at a rate of 2 l/s/ha or less (see above).
Water uantit standard ontro of ea rate of runoff
a Control peak runoff rates during events likely to impact on morphology, ecology or capacity
of receiving surface waters, or capacity of receiving sewers
The drainage system should be designed so that peak runoff rates from the site for events likely
to be significant for the morphology/ecology/capacity of receiving surface waters, or the capacity
of receiving sewers (normally specified as approximately a 11 year event) are constrained to the
greenfield rates of runoff for the same return period.
b Control peak runoff rates during extreme rainfall events
The drainage system should be designed so that the peak runoff rates for extreme rainfall events (normally
specified as a 1100 year event) are constrained to the greenfield rates of runoff for the same event.
The assessment of peak runoff rates and the design of attenuation storage systems is set out in
Sections 24.6 and 24.9, respectively. The critical duration rainfall event should be used in determining
the maximum attenuation storage volumes. Different critical durations will apply to different storage and
conveyance elements used on the site.
Interpretation of this standard is presented as follows.
a ontro ea runoff rates durin eents ie to imat on morhoo eoo or aait
of the reeiin surfae aters or the aait of reeiin seers
A bankfull event for a stream or river tends to equate to about a 1:1 or 1:2 year event. By aiming to
replicate greenfield runoff rates for this sie of event, the receiving watercourse can be protected from
erosion and the resulting morphological and ecological damage. For previously developed sites, site
runoff rates should be reduced to the greenfield rates wherever possible.
By limiting discharges to sewers (and surface waters), this will reduce the impact on downstream
capacity. If discharging to a combined sewer, this also reduces the impact on CSO spills and downstream
wastewater treatment works.
For soils with relatively high permeabilities, the 11 year greenfield runoff rate may be considered too low
to be feasible. In this case, a minimum throttle rate should be agreed by the drainage approving body. An
appropriate limit is likely to be 12 l/s/ha. Guidance on controlling low flows is provided in Chapter 28.
b ontro ea runoff rates for etreme eents to reent surfae ater runoff from the site
inreasin donstream ood ris
Aiming to replicate greenfield runoff rates for extreme events helps ensure that the flood risk associated
with the receiving watercourse/sewer is not increased by the development. Volume control (as required by
water quantity standard 1) is also an important part of the flood risk mitigation approach.
46 Part B: Philosophy and approach
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
For previously developed sites, site runoff rates should be reduced to the greenfield rates wherever
possible. Because the critical duration for the attenuation storage system for the proposed development
will be much longer than the storm duration used for sizing pipework for the previously developed site,
there is a risk that by allowing previously developed runoff rates to occur (over a much longer duration)
receiving watercourse damage and flood risk could be considerably worsened. Thus, betterment of at
least 30% should be considered as a minimum requirement (this will need establishing and agreeing with
drainage approving body) and strong consideration should still be given to controlling volumes of runoff to
greenfield equivalents (Section 3.3.1).
Water uantit standard ontro of onsite ood ris arisin from the surfae ater

a SuDS capacity design
There should not be any flooding on site for events up to the agreed drainage system capacity
(standard of service usually a minimum of a 10 year event), unless areas are specifically
designed to do so.
b Exceedance capacity design
The risks associated with events that exceed the capacity of the drainage system should be
evaluated, and the design of the site and the drainage system should be integrated so that flooding is
appropriately managed.
a SuDS aait desin
The SuDS should be designed so that runoff is completely contained within the designated drainage
system for all events up to the specified standard of service for the critical duration event for the system
(Box 3.1). This level of service will normally be 1 in 0 years as a minimum unless otherwise specified by
or agreed with the planning approval or SuDS approving body. As peak runoff rates will usually require
control up to the 1 in 100 year (see water quantity standard 2), components may be designed to manage
events up to this sie. The designated drainage system is the combination of the above-ground and
below-ground components of the system (eg pervious pavements, swales, detention basins and pipes)
that are designed to receive runoff during an event that equates to the specified standard of service.
Unless specific adaptation measures are agreed, the design rainfall for this scenario should include
an allowance for climate change, and the assumed impermeable area for the site should include an
allowance for urban creep (Section 24.7).
The critical duration rainfall event should be used. Different critical durations will apply to different parts of
the site.
The layout of the development site and the SuDS scheme should be designed so that any surface
water that enters the site from off-site sources is conveyed safely around or through the site, without
compromising the level of service of the proposed drainage system or introducing unacceptable
additional risks on site or downstream.
Where runoff from off-site sources is drained together with the site runoff, the contributing catchment
should be modelled as part of the drainage system in order to take full account of the additional inflows.
Where runoff from off-site sources is conveyed separately from the proposed drainage system, any
flood risks associated with this source should be managed appropriately. This should be dealt with in the
Flood Risk Assessment (FRA) (or Flood Consequence Assessment, FCA) and associated management
strategy for the site.
b eedane aait desin
Properties should be fully protected against flooding from the site drainage system for the 1100 year
event. Higher return periods may be specified for particular catchments or locations and this should
Chapter 3: Designing for water quantity
47
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
be established by the FRA/FCA for the site. In Scotland, the standard requirement is for 1200 year
protection. The design rainfall for this scenario should include an allowance for climate change, and the
assumed impermeable area for the site should include an allowance for urban creep (Section 24.7).
The critical duration rainfall event should be used. Different critical durations will apply to different parts
of the site.
The finished ground floor levels and the level of any opening into any basement of the proposed
buildings on the site should be at least 00 mm above the predicted flood level associated with the
above scenario or as otherwise specified by the drainage approving body and confirmed within the
site FRA/FCA.
Access should be provided into and through the site for emergency vehicles for extreme runoff events
and where the site could be flooded from other sources.
The design of the drainage system for exceedance flow management should take account of any residual
flood risks for the site that are identified by the FRA/FCA. An assessment should also be made of the
potential significance of risks associated with the following scenarios
1 a blockage or failure of any key component or structure
2 failure of any embankment that forms part of a storage component
3 rainfall events that are larger than the design storms used for the design of the drainage system
Where any of these scenarios are considered to present a significant risk for the site, a risk assessment
should be undertaken to determine adequate risk mitigation measures.
When assessing the risks associated with conveyance routes or storage areas for exceedance flows, flow
depths, velocities, duration and impact of the flooding to people and property on and off the site should
be taken into account. Further guidance on designing for exceedance in urban drainage can be found in
Digman et al (2006 and 2014).

quality
This chapter explains the objective of designing for water quality and
the design criteria that should be followed to deliver this objective. Good
practice design standards are also presented.
This chapter should be read alongside Chapters 3, 5 and 6 to understand how the
different SuDS design criteria relate to each other and Chapter 7 to understand when
and how to apply these criteria.
Guidance on designing individual SuDS components for treatment can be found in
Chapters 11–23.
Information regarding urban runoff contaminants, together with methods for assessing
level of hazard, is presented in Chapter 26.
4.1 WATER QUALITY DESIGN OBJECTIVE
Manage the quality of runoff to prevent pollution
Diffuse urban pollution (ie pollution from widespread multiple sources – see Chapter 1)
is a significant factor in compromising groundwater and receiving water standards that
are required under the EU Water Framework Directive. The UK government recognises
that tackling diffuse pollution originating from urban runoff is a high priority and the
increased use of SuDS is an important means of reducing urban runoff and improving
the water quality of that runoff (Defra, 2012).
Agricultural land can also be a significant source of pollution, but this is not covered by
this manual. Guidance on SuDS for agricultural sites is provided by Avery (2012).
Pipes are usually designed to convey water at velocities that keep sediment in
suspension, preventing build-up within the pipe but transferring the runoff and any
associated pollution directly to the receiving surface waters. Although some gullypots
and catchpits can trap sediment, their efficacy is strongly linked to the frequency of
maintenance, and there are significant risks associated with poor-quality water that is
stored in them being remobilised and washed downstream. SuDS can treat and clean
surface water runoff from urban areas so that the receiving environment is protected,
while at the same time conveying, storing and infiltrating surface water to protect flood
risk, river morphology and water resources, and delivering amenity and biodiversity
value for the development.
There is large variability in the level of pollutants in urban runoff. Sources of pollution
from impermeable surfaces are summarised in Table 4.1. Evidence relating to urban
runoff pollution is presented in Section 26.4. Untrafficked areas are usually the
least contaminated, with levels of contamination tending to rise with traffic intensities
(particularly manoeuvring frequencies and lorry movements) and with higher risks of
spillages and process contaminants from commercial and/or industrial activities.
Chapter 4: Designing for water quality

CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Factors affecting pollution levels in urban runoff are set out in Box 4.1, with antecedent weather
conditions (which affects the build-up of contaminants on the surface) and rainfall characteristics
influencing the amount of pollution washed off the site in any individual rainfall event.
Information regarding urban runoff contaminants is presented in Chapter 26 (Annex 1) together with
methods for assessing the level of haard posed (Section 26.7).
BOX

The amount and type of pollution washed off a surface will depend on many things including
planned activities on, above and adjacent to the surface that affect the deposition of pollutants,
their retention on the surface and the extent to which they are mixed with runoff (including
pollution prevention strategies – see Chapter 27)
unplanned activities (accidents and spillages) that can cause temporary unexpected high
pollutant concentrations such as from a road accident or poor pollution prevention practices on
construction sites, housing estates, commercial and industrial ones or waste management areas
the surface location and type, affecting wash-off rates and contaminant movement mechanisms
the drainage path
the length of the dry weather period before the rainfall event
the intensity and duration of the rainfall, and the associated flow velocities
any further pollutant transformations occurring during residence and conveyance within gullies,
chambers, pipe or channel networks, gravels, soils and vegetation and quiescent bodies of water.
The pollution risk posed by the site will depend on the sensitivity of the receiving environment, the
pathway between the source of the runoff and the receiving waters, and the level of dilution available. The
variety, scale and complexity of diffuse urban pollution can potentially lead to a range of intermittent acute
(short-term) impacts and chronic (longer-term) impacts.
The overall impact of the site on water quality in the receiving waters is dependent on the following
z the types of pollutants on the site, as these have different effects on the receiving water body
(Table 4.1)
z the peak pollutant concentrations in the runoff from the site, as these can cause acute (short-
term) toxicity in the receiving waters
z the total pollutant load likely to be conveyed in the runoff from the site to the receiving
environment, as this can cause chronic (long-term) pollution and gradual deterioration, owing to
cumulative build-up of pollutants.
The relationship between peak pollutant concentrations and total pollutant load is discussed in Box 4.2.
Potential impacts on receiving surface waters include the blanketing of river beds with sediment and
the reduction of light penetration from suspended solids causing negative impacts on ecosystems. In
some cases, this can result in the slow decline in biodiversity and ultimately the death of the river.
Dissolved pollutants and hydrocarbons can lead to reductions in natural oxygen levels in surface waters,
toxic conditions, metals bioaccumulation, contamination of benthic organisms, and the death of fish
and other animals. In extreme cases (often because of misconnections with the foul sewerage system),
significant levels of pathogens may also be present in the runoff, and these can be haardous to human
health in the event of exposure.
Pollution of groundwater, although less obvious than pollution of surface waters, tends to be
irreversible and permanent. Groundwater quality is at risk from both point source pollution (eg a leak from
52 Part B: Philosophy and approach
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
an oil storage tank) and diffuse pollution (eg leaking sewers or infiltration of contaminated runoff). Good
quality groundwater is crucial for water-dependent plants and animals, and as a source of drinking water.
Nitrates, pesticides, solvents, metals, hydrocarbons and other pollutants can potentially find their way into
groundwater with the level of risk posed depending on the following
z The type of pollutant. Trace metal contaminants are conservative and will ultimately migrate
through the unsaturated one the soil layer between the land surface and the groundwater level.
Organic and some inorganic compounds, however, have the potential to undergo degradation as
they pass through the soil. Usually biodegradation is the most important process affecting organic
compounds, but other processes such as hydrolysis, reduction and substitution may be relevant to
specific compounds and subsurface environments.
z The depth of the unsaturated zone. Greater depths will tend to increase the time taken for
contaminants to migrate down to groundwater and potentially reduce the contaminant concentrations
at this point, where degradation processes occur in the soil profile.
z The characteristics of the unsaturated zone. Some soils will provide better contaminant retention
and storage, increasing the length of time before contaminants migrate down through the soil to
groundwater, and better facilitating contaminant degradation. For example, fine grained materials will
provide a better barrier to pollutant migration than materials with fissure or fracture flow paths.
z e leel of uilu of ontaminants itin te soil rofile This will be a function of the
contaminant loading rate and the length of time over which contaminants have accumulated. Higher
loading rates are likely to reduce the period over which contaminants are retained within the soils
and prevented from downward migration.
It is therefore important to design drainage systems to protect both surface waters and groundwaters,
by assessing the potential risk posed by the site and putting in place adequate measures to reduce the
risk to acceptable levels (Section 4.2.2). This helps ensure that all discharges meet the requirements
of relevant legislation, and that discharges from SuDS are sufficiently low risk that they will not require
permitting or licensing by the environmental regulator.
Designing for water quality using a risk-based approach is discussed in Section 4.2.

4.2
Pollutant concentrations and loads
A peak flush of pollutants often occurs during the early stages of a storm event, before the flow
rate in the system reaches its peak. It is possible to get a high initial pollution concentration for
relatively small rainfall events, as it does not take a great deal of rain to wash off the pollutants. This
is why it is important to manage the frequent small events effectively.
Figure 4.1 shows how pollution concentration (red) and cumulative pollution load (green) change
over time for sediments transported during a rainfall event, compared to the flow rate (blue). This
shows the initial flush of pollutants shortly after the start of the event, and then there is a second
peak later in the event, which coincides with a further increase in flow rate, as runoff from more
distant parts of the site reaches the downstream system.
These peaks in sediment concentration are typical of sediments transported from urban surfaces
and also for the pollutants that are predominantly attached to the sediments during an event, such
as hydrocarbons, organic compounds and heavy metals. Other pollutants (including dissolved
pollutants) can show different runoff patterns, but all show high initial concentrations due to initial
wash-off of pollutants from the catchment surface.

4.2 WATER QUALITY DESIGN CRITERIA
4.2.1 Summary
The design criteria presented here should be applied to manage the quality of runoff to support and
protect the natural environment effectively. Managing water quality can also contribute to the design
criteria for water quantity, amenity and biodiversity and, therefore, should be considered alongside these
(see Chapters 3, 5 and 6).
Indicators can be used to evaluate the extent to which these design criteria are being delivered by a
SuDS design. Water quality design criteria and example indicators are presented in Table 4.2.
TABLE
4.2
Water quality design criteria and example indicators

the surface and facilitates treatment
The extent to which the design of the system demonstrates attention to

2 Design system resilience to cope
with future change
The design of the system includes allowances for climate change and
urban creep
These design criteria are discussed in more detail in following subsections. Where minimum performance
targets or specific levels of service should be achieved by a SuDS design, these are detailed in Section
4.3, and guidance is provided as to how these can be met. Regional or local standards as set out in
adopted supplementary planning documents (SPDs) may take precedence.
4.2.2 Water quality criterion 1: Support the management of water quality in receiving surface waters
and groundwaters
To protect the water quality of receiving surface waters and groundwaters effectively (both now and
in the future), runoff discharged from the site should be of an acceptable water quality. Even where a
receiving water already contains elevated levels of pollutants, and the surface water discharge is unlikely
to have a significant impact, pollutants generated by site activities should be managed on site. This helps
ensure that current or future water quality objectives for the receptor are not compromised and that risks
associated with acute (temporary and unexpected high contaminant loadings) are minimised.
Pollution control can be achieved through
z Pollution prevention: stopping contaminants becoming mixed with runoff, for example road
sweeping, preventing misconnections, bunds for oil tanks, controlling sediment. Where pollution
prevention is a fundamental part of environmental protection, it should deliver predictable and
guaranteed outcomes. This is normally only achievable on sites where the site operator is also
responsible for the drainage system and any downstream pollution, such as on industrial sites.
Community strategies are valuable in reducing risks to downstream SuDS performance, but as
these are voluntary, such strategies cannot be relied upon to deliver the required outcome. Pollution
prevention strategies are discussed in detail in Chapter 27.

z Interception: preventing runoff (and the associated pollution load) from the majority of small
rainfall events, for example through the use of pervious surfaces and vegetated collection systems.
Interception helps facilitate the retention of pollutants in surface vegetation, soil or other material
layers from where a proportion can often be degraded. This can reduce the potential total pollution
load discharged to the receiving surface waters over the year (noting that risks to groundwater
should always be managed effectively). The requirement for Interception is set out as water quality
standard 1 in Section 4.3.1. It is also required by water quantity standard 1 in Section 3.3.1, and
guidance on designing for Interception is set out in Section 24.8.
z Treatment: implementing SuDS components (in series where required) that use a range of
treatment processes to reduce contaminant levels in the runoff to acceptable levels. Treatment
components will often deliver Interception and usually also meet conveyance and storage
requirements. The requirement for treatment is set out as water quality standard 2 in Section 4.3.2.
Guidance on designing a treatment system is set out in Section 26.8.
z Maintenance and remedial work to remove captured pollutants and maintain system performance
(Chapter 32).
Treatment design, wherever practicable, should be based on the good practice described in Box 4.3.
The opportunities for a designer to apply these practices in full will be dependent on site characteristics,
development context and local planning objectives. To maximise the opportunities afforded by these
approaches, they should be considered at an early stage of the design process and fully integrated into
that process.
The wide range and levels of contaminants in surface runoff, together with the natural variability
associated with SuDS pollution removal processes (Section 26.6) means that water quality needs to be
managed using a robust, risk-based approach. This is usually facilitated via a SuDS Management Train
of a number of components in series that provide a range of treatment processes delivering gradual
improvement in water quality and providing an environmental buffer for accidental spills or unexpected
high pollutant loadings from the site (Section 26.8). In some cases, it may be possible to deliver the
appropriate risk management using a single component, where this has been designed to deliver the
required pollution control for the range of expected contaminants.
The most appropriate approach for managing pollution on any site often depends on how the site is split
up in terms of ownership or use, the layout and characteristics of the development and the best ways of
delivering the quantity, amenity and biodiversity design criteria (Chapters 3, 5 and 6).
Managing pollution close to its source can help keep pollutant levels and accumulation rates low
allowing natural treatment processes to be effective. This can help maximise the amenity and biodiversity
value of downstream surface SuDS components and can keep maintenance activities straightforward
and cost-effective. Where a site is owned or used by more than one individual or organisation (eg on
commercial/industrial sites), it allows sources of pollution to be traced and controlled, so the location of
SuDS components on a site can be fundamental to their success in managing pollution. Treatment can
often be delivered within the same components that are delivering water quantity design criteria, hence
requiring no extra cost or land-take.

4.3
Good practice for SuDS treatment design
1 Manage surface water runoff close to source
Where practicable, treatment systems should be designed to be close to the source of runoff. The
advantages of this approach from a water quality perspective are as follows
It is easier to design effective treatment when the flow rate and pollutant loadings are relatively low.
The treatment provided can be proportionate to the pollutant loadings, ie parts of the site with low
pollutant loads do not need to have as much treatment as highly polluting parts of the site.
Accidental spills or other pollution events can be isolated more easily and dealt with effectively
without affecting the downstream drainage system.
It encourages ownership of pollution, for example having treatment delivered on individual plots
(where responsibility for performance and maintenance of the SuDS component(s) lies with the
property owner) or adjacent to specific lengths of road.
Poor treatment performance or component damage/failure can be isolated more easily and
dealt with effectively without impacting on the whole site.
2 Treat surface water runoff on the surface
Where practicable, treatment systems should be designed to be on the surface. The advantages of
this approach from a water quality perspective are as follows
Where sediments are exposed to UV light, photolysis and volatilisation processes can act to
break down contaminants specifically oils and other hydrocarbons.
If sediment is trapped in accessible parts of the SuDS, it can be removed easily as part of
routine landscape maintenance work.
It enables use of evapotranspiration and some infiltration to the ground to reduce runoff volumes
and associated total contaminant loads (ie Interception), provided that the risk to groundwater is
managed appropriately (Section 26.7).
It allows treatment to be delivered by vegetation.
Sources of pollution can be easily identified.
Accidental spills or misconnections are visible immediately and can be dealt with rapidly.
Poor treatment performance or component damage/failure is easily identified during routine
inspections, and remedial works can be planned efficiently.
3 Treat surface water runoff to remove a range of contaminants
The SuDS design should consider the likely presence and significance of any contaminant that may
pose a risk to the receiving environment, and the SuDS component or combination of components
selected should include treatment processes that, in combination, are likely to reduce this risk to
acceptably low levels.
4 Minimise risk of sediment remobilisation
The SuDS design should consider and mitigate the risks of sediments (and other contaminants)
being remobilised and washed into receiving surface waters (or onto surfaces through which runoff
is designed to infiltrate) during events greater than those for which the treatment component has
been specifically designed. Guidance is provided in each of the technical component chapters
(Chapters 11–23).
5 Minimise impacts from accidental spills
By using a number of components in series, SuDS design can help ensure that accidental spills are
trapped in/on upstream component surfaces, facilitating contamination management and removal.
The selected SuDS components should deliver a robust treatment design that manages the risks
appropriately taking account of the uncertainty and variability associated with both the pollution
loadings and the treatment processes.
58 Part B: Philosophy and approach
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
4.2.3 Water quality criterion 2: Design system resilience to cope with future change
In order that the drainage system will continue to provide effective management of runoff to support and
protect the natural environment, SuDS treatment designs should take account of the potential impacts
of climate change on the system processes and associated performance, and consider measures/
approaches that aim to make the system more resilient.
Key projected climate changes relevant for treatment systems are increases in ambient temperatures
and reduced rainfall during the summer both of which may affect the survival or success of some types
of plants. Increased temperatures of runoff can also be damaging to sensitive ecosystems, but this risk
should be mitigated to some extent through the use of SuDS.
It is less important to design in system resilience to manage increased runoff (for water quality
management), due to the focus on preventing and/or treating relatively low flows.
4.3 WATER QUALITY DESIGN STANDARDS
The following are standards of good practice. Local planning documents or national standards may
take precedence.
4.3.1 Water quality standard 1: Prevent runoff from the site to receiving surface waters for the
majority of small rainfall events
No runoff should be discharged from the site to receiving surface waters or sewers for the majority of
small (eg 5 mm) rainfall events. This is termed Interception.
This standard is the same as water quantity standard 1a (Section 3.3.1). This is because the delivery of
Interception provides both water quantity and water quality benefits.
Runoff from small rainfall events can pose a particular problem for water quality in receiving surface
waters because
z it contains the initial flush of pollutants that has built up on surfaces during the preceding dry period
(Box 4.2)
z there are many more smaller rainfall events than larger ones, leading to frequent flushing of
pollutants from surfaces
z the volume of runoff from all small rainfall events tends to comprise a significant proportion of the total
runoff volume in any given period, and together with the relatively higher pollution concentrations, can
contribute significantly to total pollutant loadings from the site over a specified period of time.
Retaining these regular events and their pollutant loads on site will help protect receiving surface waters
against ongoing chronic pollution risks and contaminant accumulation. Where Interception includes
infiltration, even though volumes may be small, the protection of groundwater should be fully considered
and any risks managed to acceptable levels (Section 26.7). Although a proportion of pollutants retained
within SuDS components in soils is likely to be degraded, some pollutants are likely to build up over
time. Therefore, these may need removing during routine maintenance (eg sediments from sediment
removal components) or as part of component rehabilitation (eg when the capacity of soil layers to
retain pollutants has been exhausted, although this is unlikely to be required during the design life of the
development, if the drainage system is designed correctly see Scott Wilson, 2010).
Rainfall events that are less than or around 5 mm in depth comprise more than half of all rainfall events
across the UK. On natural catchments, such events rarely produce any runoff at all. However, on
impermeable catchments, runoff tends to be generated for almost all events. The hydraulic drivers for
designing drainage systems that retain and prevent runoff from the first 5 mm of rainfall for the majority
of rainfall events, are set out in Chapter 3 and include protecting the receiving surface waters from
morphological and associated ecological damage from unnatural regular surface water discharges.
Chapter 4: Designing for water quality
59
4.3.2 60 CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Interception can be delivered via rainwater harvesting systems, green roofs, infiltration systems, pervious
surfaces and vegetated SuDS. By using the storage available in soil or aggregate matrices, together
with evapotranspiration and infiltration processes, many components can intercept 5 mm of rainfall for
contributing surfaces several times greater than their own surface area. Interception design methods are
set out in Section 24.8.
Requiring Interception for the majority of events recognises that once soils are saturated (mainly
during or following long periods of wet winter weather) runoff will occur, and drainage systems cannot be
expected to prevent this. Events that follow on quickly from a previous event may also not be completely
captured by a drainage system designed for Interception.
Maximising Interception in the summer months is particularly important for protecting receiving surface
waters. Runoff during the summer months can cause greater problems for receiving surface waters than
runoff in winter months, due to low flows in the receiving surface water. Limited dilution of pollutants within
runoff and within the receiving surface water receptor may cause increased localised pollutant impact.
Water quality standard 2: Treat runoff to prevent negative impacts on the receiving water quality
Runoff should be adequately treated to protect the receiving water body from
1 Short-term acute pollution that may result from accidental spills or temporary high pollution
loadings within the catchment area.
2 Long-term chronic pollution from the spectrum of runoff pollutant sources within the urban environment.
The extent of treatment required will depend on the land use, the level of pollution prevention in the
catchment (Chapter 27) and for groundwater the natural protection afforded by underlying soil layers.
High haard sites will have a higher potential pollution load and higher potential maximum pollution
concentrations. They will therefore tend to require more treatment than low haard sites in order to deliver
discharges of an acceptable quality. The land use will also dictate the likely significance of different types
of contaminants in the runoff, and this may influence the treatment processes that need inclusion within
the treatment system. The treatment processes provided by different SuDS components will have varying
capabilities to remove different types of contaminants.
Most sites will be relatively low risk, and the risk can be mitigated by implementing SuDS components
close to the source of runoff and in sequence where higher levels of protection are required (ie the SuDS
Management Train). SuDS components usually offer a range of treatment processes and, in sequence,
deliver gradual improvements in water quality, as well as providing an environmental buffer for accidental
spills or unexpected high pollutant loadings from the site
Guidance on designing a treatment system using a SuDS Management Train is provided in
Section 26.8.
Discharges to receiving waters that are close to a drinking water abstraction point may require greater
protection, so an extra treatment component (over and above what is sufficient for standard discharges)
may be required in the SuDS Management Train to adequately manage the risks associated with
unexpected temporary high pollution loadings and/or poor system performance.
In England and Wales, reference to local planning documents should also be made to identify any
further protection required for sites due to habitat conservation (Chapter 7). The implications of
developments on or in close proximity to an area with an environmental designation, such as a site
of special scientific interest (SSSI), should be considered via consultation with relevant conservation
bodies such as Natural England.
Discharges from some land uses (eg industrial sites) may be considered particularly high risk in which
case the drainage system will need to be designed to meet the requirements established by a site-
specific risk assessment (Section 26.7.3) and agreed with the environmental regulator. Design solutions
will depend on the level of risk and may include one or more of the following
Part B: Philosophy and approach
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
z an additional SuDS component in the Management Train or an active intervention (eg stopcock,
penstock or other control structure that is watertight at low hydraulic heads) to adequately manage
the risks associated with spillages (acute pollution), poor system performance (eg due to seasonal
impacts), the inherent performance variability of natural systems and/or delays in effecting
maintenance
z a bespoke treatment system where the range, type and level of the contaminants and the
performance of the system in managing the contaminants is well understood in such scenarios,
ongoing monitoring of the system will often be required
z prevention of the discharge (eg by covering the activity and draining the area to the foul sewer) or
site-specific pollution prevention strategies.
The requirements for discharges to surface waters need to be considered where the runoff from frequent
events (eg up to about a 11 year event) is conveyed via the drainage system to a receiving surface
water body. The design water quality event for components that treat runoff as it flows through media
or vegetation is usually set as the 1 year, 15 minute (or other relevant critical duration) event. For ponds
the design water quality event is usually set as a depth of rainfall (Section 23.5). Where discharges to
surface waters will only occur for larger events, pollution risks are generally not considered significant,
and treatment is generally not required (although this should be checked on a site-specific basis with the
environmental regulator).
With respect to the requirements for discharges to groundwater, the environmental regulators in different
parts of the UK take different approaches to the level of infiltration considered to pose a potential risk
z In England and Wales, the requirements for discharges to groundwater should be considered
wherever there is a chance of infiltration, even when this will only be in small amounts (eg from the
base of conveyance swales and detention basins), as well as for components designed specifically
for infiltration.
z In Scotland and Northern Ireland, the requirements for discharges to groundwater only need to be
considered where components are designed specifically for infiltration (eg soakaways, infiltration
trenches, infiltration basins).
Groundwater protection is required for any event 1 year where the runoff is discharged via infiltration.
The following points should be noted when using Table 4.3
Discharges to either surface waters and/or groundwater
1 If the specific land use associated with the catchment to be drained is not given in the table, then
guidance on the appropriate approach should be sought from the environmental regulator.
2 Contaminated runoff from areas handling haardous or highly polluting materials, such as food
waste, chemical and fuel handling areas, animal management and agricultural facilities*, vehicle
refuelling or washing operations should be minimised (eg by covering) and any wash-off that is
generated should be drained to an appropriately maintained and managed, sealed and discrete
disposal solution, such as the foul sewer. The protection of nitrate-vulnerable ones is also likely to
be relevant (https://www.gov.uk/nitrate-vulnerable-zones).
* Note that in England, guidance on rural SuDS is provided by Avery (2012).
Developments such as industrial sites, waste management sites and lorry and bus/coach parking
or turning areas need to be discussed as part of pre-permitting discussions with the environmental
regulator, and they may need authorisation (Box 4.4). In such circumstances SuDS may still be
appropriate, but the design of the system will be dependent on the outcomes of a site-specific risk
assessment (Section 26.7.3).
Chapter 4: Designing for water quality

BOX

Discharges to groundwater only
1 The discharge of clean roof water to the ground is acceptable provided that (a) all roof water
downpipes are sealed against pollutants entering the system from polluted surface runoff, effluent
disposal or other forms of discharge and (b) gross sediments and silts are removed upstream of the
infiltration component.
2 There should be a minimum depth of 1 m of unsaturated aquifer material between the base of any
infiltration system and the maximum likely groundwater level (taking account of potential shifts in
groundwater level resulting from extended periods of wet weather). Evidence from groundwater
records may demonstrate the maximum groundwater levels, but where there is any uncertainty,
appropriate groundwater monitoring should be undertaken to demonstrate levels across the site.
Ground investigation should establish the typical maximum upper level of the saturated layer of an
unconfined aquifer. Typical in this context would be a representative winter water table level, based
on hydrogeological records and/or expert opinion and discounting extremes in weather or artificial
suppression by engineering techniques such as pumping.
The method of discharge should not create new pathways for pollutants to groundwater or mobilise
contaminants already in the ground (EA, 201).
For contaminated land sites, the site investigation report should be used to identify any residual
hotspots where pollutants are still likely to be present, and these areas should be located on the site
plan. Any infiltration through contaminated soils could potentially mobilise or remobilise pollutants,
alter remedial measures undertaken on site and cause pollution of groundwater. Guidance on an
appropriate approach for this should be sought from the environmental regulator. A discharge that
disturbs land that subsequently causes a release of pollutants to groundwater may potentially require
an environmental permit, or alter liabilities under Part IIa of the Environmental Protection Act 1990.
Guidance on designing SuDS for contaminated land sites is included in Section 8.2.
UK regulations for discharges to groundwaters
The regulators in England and Wales should be consulted if a discharge meets the definition of a
groundwater activity under the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2010 and
does not meet an appropriate exemption.
In Northern Ireland, a discharge consent, groundwater authorisation or pollution prevention and
control (PPC) permit may be required for surface water discharges to the ground.
In Scotland, an authorisation under the Water Environment (Controlled Activities) (Scotland)
Regulations (CAR) 2011 or a pollution prevention and control (PPC) permit may be required. In
Scotland, certain discharges to surface waters are automatically authorised by general binding rules
(GBR). In such cases, it is not necessary to apply for authorisation from SEPA, but the design and
discharge must comply with the conditions of the GBR.

2 In Scotland, the Water Environment (Controlled Activities) (Scotland) Regulations (CAR) 2011 General Binding Rules, Rule 10 (d)
(iv) effectively provides an exemption from requiring SuDS for coastal discharges. However, control of any contaminants likely to
be present in surface water runoff is still required, but can be delivered using alternative methods such as proprietary treatment
products. As the term SuDS’ in this manual includes proprietary treatment products, this exemption is not valid in this context.
The application of the simple index approach should follow the approach outlined in Section 26.7.1 (or equivalent approved).
Risk screening is an assessment to identify high risk scenarios where the Environment Agency or Natural Resources Wales
(NRW) would wish to be consulted regarding infiltration of water from surface runoff in order to agree the proposed design
approach. The risk screening method is provided in Section 26.7.2.
5 The risk assessment should determine the appropriate design approach to mitigate risk to acceptable levels following the
guidance outlined in Section 26.7.3. This assessment should be approved by the environmental regulator.

Designing for amenity
This chapter explains the objective of designing for amenity, and the
design criteria that should be followed to deliver this objective.
This chapter should be read alongside Chapters 3, 4 and 6 to understand how the
different SuDS design criteria relate to each other, and Chapter 7 to understand when
and how to apply these criteria.
Further discussion on designing for amenity specifically within the urban context can
be found in Chapter 10.
5.1 AMENITY DESIGN OBJECTIVE
Create and sustain better places for people
Good urban design aims to deliver attractive, pleasant, useful and above all liveable
urban environments that support and enhance local communities (Box 5.1). Water
is a valuable natural resource, and the management of rainfall and runoff can form
a key part of an urban vision. Designs using surface water management systems to
help structure the urban landscape can enrich its aesthetic and recreational value,
promoting health and well-being and supporting green infrastructure. Water managed
on the surface, rather than underground, can help to reduce summer temperatures,
provide habitat for flora and fauna, act as a resource for local environmental education
programmes and working groups and directly influence the sense of community and
prosperity of an area. SuDS can provide opportunities for water to be visible and
audible as it travels through the landscape the places where water flows, stills, trickles
or splashes are often where it is experienced and valued the most.
BOX
5.1
Amenity, place-making and liveability
Amenity may be defined as a useful or pleasant facility or service,
which includes the tangible (something that can be measured in terms
of use), and the less tangible (something that can be experienced as
pleasure or aesthetic appreciation).
This definition is particularly relevant for describing the multi-functional
opportunities associated with SuDS designs, and it provides a link to the
concept of place-making, now commonly used in describing the quality
of a space in urban design.
Amenity also covers liveability, which is associated with factors that improve
the quality of life for inhabitants. Liveability encompasses the well-being of a
community and of individuals and comprises the many characteristics that
make a location a place where people want to live and work.
There are many amenity benefits that are intrinsic to SuDS good SuDS design
often provides amenity benefits while delivering water quantity, water quality and
biodiversity benefits.
Where the concept of “creating and sustaining better places for people” is embedded in
the design process, these benefits can be maximised. Table 5.1 provides a summary of
how SuDS can add amenity value. Further information on amenity benefits of SuDS can
be found in Digman et al (2015).

Examples
Air quality
improvements
SuDS using blue and green areas, including grass and trees, provide significant air quality
improvements by, for example, trees scrubbing fine particulates from urban streets.
Air and building
temperature
regulation
Green and blue infrastructure buffers and moderates extreme temperatures, which will
become increasingly important in future, as the climate changes and cities get hotter.
Biodiversity and
ecology
Green and blue SuDS help to support flora and fauna for the benefit of communities, and it
is here that SuDS amenity and biodiversity value come together (Chapter 6).
Carbon emission
reduction and
sequestration
Plants and soils take in and store CO2 and other greenhouse gases, so where SuDS use
plants this potential can be exploited.
SuDS tend to require less energy use in all stages of the supply chain and life cycle than
conventional drainage and, by harvesting water at source, this also saves energy.
Community cohesion
and crime reduction
SuDS can help bring communities together. By increasing opportunities for human interaction
and creating more enjoyable environments, people are more likely to feel they belong to the
community and take a greater pride in their neighbourhood. This is especially the case if the
community has been involved in the SuDS design process and residents have ownership of the
ongoing maintenance (even if only in part).
Economic growth
and inward
investment
Attractive places (particularly where water is a feature of the design) tend to encourage and
support inward investment. Productivity tends to be enhanced in attractive environments, such as
business parks with green spaces.
Green and blue SuDS have been shown to add value to land and property nearby.
The SuDS in themselves may provide interest for tourists especially where they are a novelty.
SuDS also contribute to the creation of attractive places that appeal to tourists.
Education
By using green and blue spaces as part of the management of the water cycle this provides
many opportunities to support education both formally in schools and in communities as a
whole through environmental groups.
Health and well-being Green and blue infrastructure can play an important role in maintaining mental and physical
health by providing places for recreation and relaxation (see Recreation).
Noise reduction SuDS and associated trees and grassed areas can provide noise-absorbent barriers and
surfaces. Green roofs provide sound insulation for buildings.
Security of water
supply
Direct collection of rainwater to use for domestic and other purposes saves water, and
potentially provides essential irrigation resources and long-term viability for amenity trees,
vegetation and crops.
Recreation SuDS can deliver a wide range of green and blue spaces that can be used for walking, cycling,
informal play, organised sports and games etc (see Health and well-being).
Where SuDS are part of the wider green landscape, this tends to bring the widest range of benefits to
people. The importance of green space (including spaces with water, sometimes referred to as blue space) to
the quality of urban life is well recognised. For example, it plays an important role in tackling a range of health
and social problems (Bird, 2007). Residents are more likely to reach recommended daily walking levels when
they live near safe, attractive green spaces (Bird, 200). Research studies have shown that patients in hospital
rooms with views of trees and plants made fewer requests for pain medication and experienced a speedier
recovery following surgery, compared to patients with views of streets and buildings from their windows
(Ulrich, 19). Tree views have also been shown to improve office workers’ job satisfaction (Trellis, 201).
Amenity and biodiversity are often considered together, but they are each important in their own right,
and the overlaps and linkages should be recognised by designers. Designing for biodiversity is discussed
in Chapter 6. Creating and sustaining as many amenity and biodiversity benefits as possible should be
considered alongside designing for water quantity and quality.

water attenuation and storage, biodiversity and
edible streets and gardens.
All roof water is harvested and stored in
underground tanks located in two kitchen gardens,

with white willows and damp meadow species for
biodiversity, water treatment, air improvement,
urban thermal regulation and aesthetic amenity,
making reference to the landscape signature of
this clay lowland. It is a place for playing in, with
stepping and balancing logs and bridges, and it
forms a barrier for cars that might be tempted to
park on the green.
Water filtered by vegetation is conveyed to a

a hand pump linked to a rill carved in a tree
trunk allows kids to play with water. Finally, any
excess water from the storage tank can be stored
in oversied storm drains under the road, a

5.2 AMENITY DESIGN CRITERIA
5.2.1 Summary
The amenity design criteria presented here should be applied to maximise the amenity value from a
SuDS scheme for the development and for the local and wider community.
The extent to which each amenity design criterion can be addressed by the designer will depend on
local requirements and site-specific characteristics. Amenity objectives for surface water management
systems may be specified at a catchment or local level within local development documents, and these
should be referenced and considered early in the SuDS design process.
To facilitate the design of high quality, high value and truly multi-functional urban space that delivers
effective drainage and also derives benefit from the presence of water, SuDS design should be
considered during all stages of planning and site design (Chapter 7). This level of integration and multi-
functionality is likely to require interdisciplinary working, particularly between landscape architects and
drainage engineers.
Indicators can be used to evaluate the extent to which the amenity design criteria are being delivered
by a SuDS design. The amenity design criteria and example indicators are presented in Table 5.2. A
regulatory, approving or adoption body may choose to develop alternative indicators considered more
appropriate for meeting local requirements or strategies (such as those relating to green infrastructure).
The criteria and the methods by which these criteria can be implemented for a site are then discussed
further in the following subsections. These design criteria should be considered alongside design criteria
for water quantity, water quality and biodiversity (Chapters 3, 4 and 6).

5.2.2 Amenity criterion 1: Maximise multi-functionality
Multi-functional land use will always deliver development outcomes that are more cost-effective and
viable. This becomes particularly important in dense urban areas and is discussed further in Chapter 10.
Designing SuDS so that the space in which they exist performs multiple functions becomes increasingly
important as the density and proportional impermeability of development rises. Opportunities for the
creation of SuDS can be found in even the smallest of spaces, and lack of space should not be a reason
for not using SuDS.

CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
SuDS components can have a wide range of uses in addition to their water quantity and water quality
management functions, and designers should work with planners and landscape architects to maximise
the landscape value. Examples of where land for SuDS can have an additional use are discussed below.
Recreation
SuDS can offer a wealth of opportunities within developments for both passive and active recreation for
the local community.
Where possible, surface water management systems should be designed to help create relaxing,
pleasurable, useable, useful and fun environments for local communities to enjoy. SuDS designs can
create conditions where people can interact with and enjoy water in ways that are relaxing, entertaining,
stimulating and refreshing as well as aesthetically pleasing (Section 5.2.3). Larger open water and
wetland areas can provide a focus for footpaths and trails, providing attractive areas for walkers, cyclists
and joggers, with access to the water at appropriate locations. Larger areas of permanent water in SuDS
ponds can potentially provide opportunities for angling and wildlife observation.
Water and play go well together (see Case study 5.2). Most children (as well as some adults and pets)
enjoy playing with water. While playing, children can also learn at the same time. Water areas for play
include shallow pools, artificial channels and chutes (some of which will only be wet when it rains). A
number of best practice guides are available for maximising the benefit value and opportunities from the
use of SuDS for play, for example from Planet Earth Ltd (2010).

planting beds with integrated soakaways.

CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Using exceedance storage areas (ie surface water storage ones designed to manage large, rare rainfall
events) for recreational purposes, such as sports pitches, can increase their economic viability. The likely
inundation frequency of an area and the time taken for it to recover following a flood will tend to determine
the suitability of its use for other functions. Where components of drainage systems lie beneath the
ground, the land surface can often have a secondary use, provided that this does not pose a structural
risk to the SuDS component. For example, subsurface attenuation storage systems can be sited below
permeable surfaces used for recreation, local roads or car parking.
raffi manaement
Surface water management components can often be integrated with road space, traffic management
schemes and sustainable transport corridors (eg cycle routes) to manage day-to-day and/or exceedance flows
while potentially aesthetically enhancing the urban environment. Where bioretention systems are integrated
with traffic calming build-outs, for example, they can also assist in improving local environments and bringing
enhanced economic development.

Car parking and streetscapes
Where a car parking or pedestrian/cycle way surface is designed to be pervious, surface water can be
stored and treated within the sub-base, before controlled discharge or infiltration into the ground.
Vegetated strips, swales, bioretention systems, tree pits and basins can be designed adjacent to car parks
in required green space provision to treat and control runoff, while at the same time providing amenity value
to car park users and adjacent pedestrian, commercial and residential ones. Rain gardens and bioretention
areas can be integrated into a streetscape complementing or supporting the delivery of a wide range of
street features, such as on-street parking, pedestrian crossing points and spaces for cycle hire and storage.

Horticulture
Urban communities are also increasingly creating spaces for horticulture. SuDS can support the
irrigation needs for such areas (see Chapter 3 water quantity criterion 1) and can be integrated with
new productive landscape spaces. These productive landscapes not only provide harvestable fruit and
vegetables, but also support community cohesion, the aspirations of individuals and opportunities for
employment and add to biodiversity.
5.2.3 Amenity criterion 2: Enhance visual character
Urban spaces should be designed to provide high
quality, visually attractive and appealing places
for residents, workers and visitors. Each surface
conveyance and storage component within the SuDS
Management Train can enhance the visual aesthetics
of the development and contribute to building character
(eg green roof) or to the setting for the buildings. SuDS
can be designed to integrate with and improve the built
form and surrounding urban landscape and contribute
to new or support existing green space.
Landscape Institute and the Institute of
Environmental Management and Assessment (201)
provides best practice guidance on assessing and
enhancing the visual amenity of land. Many planning
applications require some form of visual assessment.
For larger schemes, the assessment is part of the
statutory procedures in the Environmental Impact
Assessment (EIA). Landscape and visual effects
should be assessed separately despite being
linked. The former is considered as an effect on the
environment, while the latter is considered in terms
of the effects on people.
By enhancing visual character and increasing the
attractiveness of individual buildings, locations and
areas, SuDS can help contribute to a number of
amenity benefits, including enhanced economic
investment within the local area, increased
employment productivity due to the quality of the
working environment, enhanced property and land
values and increased tourism.

Chapter 5: Designing for amenity

CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Not all of these benefits are exclusively because of SuDS, and many would come about anyway if green
areas were used or open water features added to a landscape. It is important that visual benefits are not
attributed incorrectly to SuDS unless greening of an area would not have happened without SuDS being
installed (Chapter 35).
The visual aesthetic value should be considered at elevation as well as at ground level. Well designed and
integrated SuDS components can contribute to urban art, townscape character and the distinctiveness of a
location, attracting tourists and enhancing the quality of life of those who use the area. The ways in which
runoff can be managed, to provide attractive and interesting visual structures on individual buildings such as
roofs, walls, spouts, cascades, rain slides, rain chains etc, is only limited by the designer’s imagination and
creativity and the need to ensure a safe environment.
The design of a surface SuDS component should enhance the experience of movement or tranquillity
with opportunities taken to stimulate the senses, not only visually but also through sound and touch. Each
component should be attractive, and wherever possible the value of water within each part of the system
should be considered and promoted. Managing noise, by excluding unwanted sounds and replacing them
with the tranquil sound of moving water, brings the visual and the auditory experience together in helping
create enjoyable, tranquil and pleasant places.
As water flows from one component to the next, the structures that control movement should blend with the
landscape and take into account the use and place of SuDS within the surrounding area. At the same time
they should be visually neutral or positively interesting as part of the SuDS Management Train (Chapter 28).

5.2.4 Amenity criterion 3: Deliver safe surface water management systems
SuDS are no more haardous than natural ponds and wetlands, puddles and surface runoff flows on
roads, or in streams and rivers. Guidance on health and safety is provided in Chapter 36, which includes
health and safety risk assessment processes and design approaches to mitigate any potential risks
associated with the system. This criterion concerns the consideration of public safety related to the use
of the system as an amenity feature or resource.
7 Part B: Philosophy and approach
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015

The designer should mitigate any risks associated with the system, so that the interaction is sufficiently
safe for potential users.
Edges where water meets dry land need special care with each design element considered for safety
and maximum benefit to the user. Design guidance on edge designs, safe slopes, barriers etc is provided
within individual SuDS component chapters (Chapters 11–23) and summarised in Chapter 36.
Where rainwater or runoff is likely to be contaminated and unsafe for human exposure, it should be kept
within systems that do not encourage or facilitate potential contact or should be treated before use.
Provided that runoff is not contaminated, it can be used as a children’s play resource and to irrigate areas
that are used for recreation. An upstream treatment train and appropriate risk assessment will determine at
what point the water is appropriate for use as a play or amenity resource (Chapter 36). The design of amenity
features should ensure that they do not give the impression of the water being potable, for example, pumps,
fountains, or jets are usually fed with mains water and where these may be perceived as using water that is
safe to drink, or where there is significant spray or aerosols, these should not be supplied with untreated water.
Where SuDS are part of play and recreational facilities, although there are some fears about safety of
play with water, the HSE (2012) contends that there is a need to take a balanced approach and for play
providers to focus the provision of play facilities on controlling the real risks, while at the same time
securing or increasing the benefits that these facilities can provide.

CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
5.2.5 Amenity criterion 4: Support development resilience/adaptability to future change
The requirement for adaptability over the life of the SuDS should be considered as part of the design
process. Urban environments are constantly changing and never complete (Digman et al, 2012). Changes
can come about due to climate change and urban creep (Section 3.2.7), but change may also come
directly from local policy initiatives driven by, for example, local community demands, and these changes
may need to be accommodated by adapting drainage systems.
The future resilience of urban areas to climate change and societal stresses that are largely unpredictable
depends on how readily urban systems can be adapted. Surface water management systems that
integrate surface water features can be more readily modified than underground systems.
SuDS can also help developments be more resilient to future climate change. The potential use of SuDS
to deliver key sustainability and climate resilience planning objectives for the development should be
considered early in the design process, to maximise benefits and reduce costs.
Through harvesting and using rainwater, SuDS can contribute to water security of individuals and
communities where water scarcity is likely to increase. Green and blue spaces provide cooling via the
return of moisture to the air through evaporation and evapotranspiration from vegetated and water
features, which can help to reduce temperature increases in urban areas (urban heat island effect).
Trees can also provide direct cooling by providing shade for buildings and outside amenity space.
Green roofs and vegetative surfaces reflect more sunlight and absorb less heat, thereby keeping
buildings cooler in summer and, conversely, providing building insulation during winter months, which in
turn can reduce energy usage.
5.2.6 Amenity criterion 5: Maximise legibility
Where possible, it is important to bring the
process of collection, conveyance, storage and
treatment into the open, making the system and
its function more obvious to local communities,
visitors and those inspecting and maintaining
the system. Many SuDS are visible, that is
on the surface with a minimal below-ground
system (as advocated in Chapters 3 and 4).
Even when they are located on private land,
they will often be within the public realm. This
legibility encourages a connection between
the SuDS scheme, water, the community and
the place in which it sits. When it is obvious
how a surface water management system
works, local communities are more likely to act
to protect its long-term functionality, including
setting up voluntary working groups or taking
individual actions to maintain and enrich the
SuDS (see also Section 5.2.7).
Figure 5.1 Signage and todder-proof fencing at a
supermarket site (courtesy ACO Limited)
Where SuDS components are on the surface, blockages and other performance risks are also easy to
see and rectify. For example, it is easy to see when there is contamination from pollutants, especially
from misconnected foul drainage, as there will be evidence, for example, of faecal material and
associated solids from toilets, food from kitchens and discoloured grey water from washing machines
and human use.
Inlets, outlets and flow control structures in particular are critical to the effectiveness of SuDS. Their
location should be obvious and their functionality easily understood by maintenance contractors
(Chapter 28).

5.2.7 Amenity criterion 6: Support community environmental learning
Opportunities should be sought to use SuDS as a resource for community environmental learning, as this
will help to ensure that the benefits to the community of the SuDS are maximised. This is complementary
to (but separate from) community engagement. For the purposes of this manual, community engagement
refers to the planned process of working with specific groups of people to identify opportunities and
address issues affecting them or their community, such as how the proposed scheme will look, function
and be maintained (Chapter 34). Community environmental learning can come about through community
engagement or through the public’s interaction with the services and amenities provided by SuDS. This
interaction helps to foster an appreciation of natural drainage systems and the links between rainfall,
water supply, runoff, flooding and pollution.
Rainfall and runoff can provide exciting educational and playground resources. Vegetated conveyance
and/or surface pond storage systems can be designed to promote education, play and amenity value via,
for example, swale maes and pond dipping.
Community activities, related to local SuDS, can help to develop community cohesion and engender
a sense of local identity and pride where the SuDS contribute to enhancement of the environment,
especially where SuDS have been retrofitted to manage, say, a local flooding problem. Such activities
also help to encourage communities and individual property and land owners not only in looking after
their own SuDS, but potentially also the wider environment.
Raising awareness, appreciation, understanding and capacity of communities and individuals to interact
with SuDS can be supported through
z direct engagement in their planning, delivery, commissioning and operation (Chapter 34)
z the provision of information at appropriate points in the system (eg via interpretation boards, special
events and direct contact)
z promoting wider local interest in, and interaction with, SuDS via school visits, educational
presentations and inclusion in national curriculum activities
z promoting recreational and other uses of the system by both children and adults (Section 5.2.2).
Chapter 5: Designing for amenity
77
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
By involving the local community and individuals in the implementation and/or maintenance of SuDS
(such as planting days, see Figure 5.18), this can promote
z understanding of the functionality and importance of the natural environment and the place of
surface water management in mitigating human impacts on the environment
z commitment towards contributing to the management of the SuDS, which also engenders positive
attitudes towards the system, enhanced enjoyment from it and social cohesion and support mechanisms
z understanding of the importance of, and arrangements for, health and safety risk management for
the site in relation to surface water
z use of the system as an educational resource for local children and adults, with respect to safe play
near water, ecology and an understanding of the movement of rainwater through the urban and
natural environment.

06Chapter Designing for biodiversity
This chapter explains the objective of designing for biodiversity and the
design criteria that should be followed to deliver this objective.
This chapter should be read alongside Chapters 3–5 to understand how the different
SuDS design criteria relate to each other, and Chapter 7 to understand when and how
to apply these criteria.
Guidance on planting can be found in Chapter 29.
6.1 BIODIVERSITY DESIGN OBJECTIVE
Create and sustain better places for nature
Policy-makers now recognise the important contribution that designing for biodiversity
can make to ecosystem services (Box 6.1) and improved community “living” space.
“Connecting people with nature” is a UK government objective (Defra, 2011), which
SuDS can help deliver.
The benefits of creating new habitats and rehabilitating or enhancing existing habitats
through SuDS design go far beyond the contribution that planting makes to the
functionality and performance of the drainage system (Chapters 3 and 4). Landscape
features that support diverse habitats and associated ecosystems provide a healthy and
stimulating environment that can add significant value to urban living (Chapter 5). The
water within a SuDS component or scheme is an essential resource for the growth and
development of plants and animals. Biodiversity value can be delivered by even very
small, isolated schemes, but the greatest value is achieved where SuDS are planned
as part of wider green landscapes, as they can then help provide important habitat and
wildlife connectivity. With good design, SuDS can provide shelter, food and foraging
and breeding opportunities for a variety of wildlife species including plants, amphibians,
invertebrates, birds, bats and other mammals.
Designing SuDS space for biodiversity requires drainage designers, urban and
landscape designers, planners and ecologists to work together. For many sites, a
qualified ecologist is likely to be required for the project. However, all members of the
SuDS design team should understand the principles behind designing for biodiversity
and should recognise the benefits that result.
Amenity and biodiversity are often considered together, but they are each important
in their own right and, although the overlaps and linkages should be recognised by
designers, they are dealt with in separate chapters of this manual. Designing for
amenity is discussed in Chapter 5. Creating and sustaining as many amenity and
biodiversity benefits as possible should be considered alongside designing for water
quantity and quality.
The design of habitats in SuDS needs consideration and integration at all stages in
the planning process, from master planning to detailed design (Chapter 7), taking into
consideration broader green infrastructure objectives where applicable, if it is to deliver
maximum biodiversity value. There are well-established techniques for creating habitats
in new landscapes serving developments, and these are described in general habitat
creation guidance in Dale et al (2011) and for previously developed land in Jackson et al
(2011). The formal process of integrating biodiversity considerations and delivery into all
stages of the planning, design and development process is set out in BS 42020:2013.

Bioiersity encompasses the number, abundance and distribution of all species of life on earth.
It includes the diversity of individual species, the genetic diversity within species and the range
of habitats that support them. Biodiversity also includes humans and our interactions with the
environment (Dale et al, 2011). Locally, biodiversity reflects the character of the plants and wildlife
that share the space in which humans live, work and play.
oloy is the study of plants and animals and the relationships between them and their physical
environment.
n eosystem is a biological community and its physical environment (Dale et al, 2011).
Reconciliation ecology is the branch of ecology that studies ways to encourage biodiversity in
human-dominated (eg urban) ecosystems.
osystem series are the benefits provided by ecosystems that contribute to making human life
both possible and worth living. Examples of ecosystem services include products such as food and
water, regulation of floods, soil erosion and disease outbreaks, and non-material benefits such as
recreational and spiritual benefits in natural areas (Albon et al, 2011).
atural aital refers to the elements of nature that produce value to people, such as the stock of
forests, water, land, minerals and oceans. These provide benefits such as food, clean air, wildlife, energy,
wood, recreation and protection from hazards (Natural Capital Committee: tttinyurlomof).
reen infrastruture is a term to describe strategically planned and interconnected networks of
natural and manmade green spaces (including blue space) or corridors that deliver a function for the
local community.

sufficiently to provide valuable habitat and a safe and visually pleasing public open space.
6.2 BIODIVERSITY DESIGN CRITERIA
The biodiversity design criteria presented here should be applied to maximise the biodiversity value from
a SuDS scheme for the development and for the local and wider environment.
The extent to which each biodiversity design criterion can be addressed by the designer will depend on
local requirements and site-specific characteristics. Biodiversity objectives for surface water management
systems may be specified at a catchment or local level within local development documents, eg green
infrastructure strategies, and these should be referenced and considered early in the SuDS design process.
Delivery of local biodiversity objectives (Setion ) in particular should be a key consideration in
the design.
Amenity design criteria are described in Chapter 5. Both amenity and biodiversity design criteria should
be considered together and at an early stage and fully integrated into the design process in order to
maximise the opportunities that can be achieved by the scheme at no or minimal extra cost.
Indicators can be used to evaluate the extent to which the biodiversity design criteria are being delivered
by a SuDS design. The biodiversity design criteria and example indicators are presented in Table 6.1.
Environmental regulators, local authorities, approval or adoption bodies may choose to develop alternative
indicators considered more appropriate for meeting local requirements.
The criteria and the methods by which they can be implemented for a site are then discussed further in
the following subsections.
6.2.1 Support and protect natural local habitats and species
The habitats and species within any new SuDS scheme should aim (where appropriate) to be similar to,
linked with and/or supportive of the natural and semi-natural local habitat and associated species.
The designer needs to understand the habitat types in the area in order to determine the most
appropriate habitats for the site, that is habitats that will work with and enhance any existing habitats and
complement the use and future objectives of the site development.
Chapter 6: Designing for biodiversity

CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Characterising the main ecological communities that might naturally thrive in the locality is an effective
starting point to define how best to conserve or create supportive habitats through the use of SuDS.
Characterisation methods are described in Chapter 7.
The most appropriate ecological design for the site will depend on:
z habitats and biodiversity that thrive naturally in the locality
z wider regional habitats and biodiversity for which the provision of connectivity through the
implementation of the SuDS would be of value
z whether there are significant natural local habitats such as wetlands that have been lost or
fragmented over time, and whether it is appropriate for these to be recreated or reconnected as part
of the development drainage design
z the characteristics of the site that will influence the suitability of vegetation, habitat types and the
species they support, such as aspect, topography, soils, local climatic and hydrological variables
z the requirements of the new site and local community, for example proposed and/or existing use,
amenity provision, development landscape character and style.

6.2.2 Contribute to the delivery of local biodiversity objectives
SuDS design should prioritise habitats and species objectives that contribute to local, regional and
national biodiversity targets (Four Countries’ Biodiversity Group, 2012).
Across Europe it is increasingly being recognised that there is a need to protect threatened species and
habitats and promote biodiversity, including restoration of habitats (wildflower grasses, wetlands etc).
SuDS can often be designed to benefit priority habitats (defined as those most threatened and requiring
conservation action) and help deliver strategic objectives set out in national and local biodiversity
strategies, frameworks and action plans.
National strategies recognise the importance of local level initiatives in creating and sustaining
biodiversity, and the funding provided for biodiversity schemes can often help to co-fund and deliver
better surface water management schemes (where these are supportive of biodiversity). When
designing SuDS, co-operation with those delivering local biodiversity strategies (including Local Nature
Partnerships) will ease approvals and also provide new opportunities to add value.
Effective and sympathetic Maintenance Plans for SuDS that take account of the wildlife supported by the
habitat provided are essential, particularly where protected species such as bats, birds in the breeding
season, water voles and great crested newts and other important invertebrates and mammals are likely
to be present. It is important to seek expert advice from ecologists to produce a plan that maintains a
favourable habitat for wildlife and, where they exist, protects sensitive and legally protected species. If
protected species are recorded or designed for at the proposed site, details of the legal requirements
associated with the species should be sought from relevant government agency guidance.
General guidance on Maintenance Plans is set out in Chapter 32 and maintenance requirements for
specific SuDS components are provided in the individual technical component chapters (Chapters 11–23).
6.2.3 Contribute to habitat connectivity
The habitats within any new SuDS scheme should, where possible, link with other local and/or regional
habitats to help build and enhance habitat connectivity within neighbourhoods and between rural/
suburban areas and towns/cities. This will help mitigate the problems associated with habitat loss and
fragmentation within urban areas. The SuDS design should consider existing or future planned habitat
corridors and networks, and evaluate how the SuDS on the site can best support or contribute to these
wider objectives by providing linking habitats or stepping stones – allowing wildlife to move from and to
rural areas, as well as being urban habitats in their own right.
Green infrastructure is vital to the creation and maintenance of ecological function in urban space
providing habitats for fauna in their own right, pathways for migrating animals and natural plant
colonisation, as well as safe passage for surface water runoff that exceeds the drainage system capacity.
Healthy ecologically functioning habitats can be promoted by linking proposed development sites
to adjacent areas with established or latent biodiversity potential and ideally with a well-developed
assemblage of plants and animals that can easily colonise the new spaces created by the SuDS design.
Unless there is significant existing contamination, all sites are likely to become colonised by plants,
followed by animal species. Best practice SuDS design for biodiversity can ensure that this colonisation is
high quality, high value and as rapid and robust as possible.
Examples of new developments where the design of the site is laid out around green corridors that
convey surface water are shown in iure .

The Gosforth Valley wetland area is owned and managed by Yorkshire Water with the support of
Dronfield Town Council and the Lea Brook Valley Volunteers.
The pond and wetland area stores and treats excess water collected from the surrounding area (via
public surface water sewers and highway drains) during and after periods of heavy rainfall. The water
level in the pond is controlled by a balancing dam that gradually releases water into the Lea Brook to
prevent flooding of areas further downstream.
The wetland area includes many native trees and plants which help to improve the amenity and
biodiversity of the site. It is very important for the conservation of wildlife within Dronfield and North
East Derbyshire. The habitat has been developed to support wetland bird species such as shoveller
(Anas clypeata), grey heron (Ardea cinerea), and snipe (Gallinago gallinago), invertebrates such as
the common darter (dragonfly) (Sympetrum striolatum), water boatman (Notonecta glauca) and water
flea (Bosmina longirostris); amphibians such as the common frog (Rana temporaria) and common
toad (Bufo bufo) and mammals such as the European water vole (Arvicola amphibius).
The site forms part of the larger Lea Brook Valley, which is a green corridor into Dronfield town centre.
The Lea Brook Valley Project is aimed at enhancing the beauty, amenities and wildlife habitat of the
valley, for the benefit of the residents and wildlife. Run by volunteers, it works with local conservation
groups, the local parish council, Yorkshire Water and others, carrying out many activities, such as
conserving the local ancient hedgerow, creating a nature trail, providing interpretation boards, planting
trees, setting up bird boxes and litter picking.
This project is one of several conservation projects in the area. Together these projects provide a ten-
mile wildlife corridor between Dronfield and Chesterfield.

6.2.4 Create diverse, self-sustaining and resilient ecosystems
SuDS schemes should aim to have a range of habitat types, as this will encourage biodiversity and result
in self-sustaining and resilient ecosystems.
Designing for ecological resilience is about ensuring that habitats, and the species they support, can
evolve as naturally as possible and continue to meet the objectives of the drainage system. Most species
require a range of environmental features within a site or a wider landscape to complete their life cycle.
Many of these elements, such as small patches of bare ground, tall flower-rich vegetation or scattered
trees and scrub, are often absent from the English landscape, and even from our most important wildlife
sites, which has contributed to species decline. SuDS components are likely to have greater species
diversity and resilient ecosystems if existing habitats are within dispersal distance for plants, invertebrates
and amphibians, allowing natural ecological colonisation and future re-colonisation should damage occur
due to pollution etc.
Climate change will affect the distribution of wildlife, habitats and the health of ecosystems which, in turn,
will have an impact on human well-being. A well-designed and managed surface water management
system will be intrinsically more resilient to changes in climate (Chapters 3–5). Equally, SuDS that
have structural diversity as well as biodiversity will promote ecological resilience, with different groups
of plants and animals emerging over time. This should not only be taken into consideration for the site
itself, but also for the wider ecosystem. For example, where SuDS help reduce habitat fragmentation
(Setion ), this will also help the movement of species as they track suitable “climate space” (ie the
geographical range of suitable climate for a species).
Structural diversity can be delivered through the use of a variety of SuDS components as part of the
overall SuDS scheme. This can be enhanced through the use of subtle changes in ground profile
(vertically and horiontally). When combined with a range of vegetation types (such as wildflowers and
other nectar-rich plants, grasses, drought-tolerant species, marginal-aquatics and wet grasslands, open
water, trees and shrubs – see Chapter 29) it is possible to deliver a diverse range of habitats for little or
no extra cost beyond the requirements for delivering water quantity and quality.
Further guidance on how to maximise biodiversity value within a SuDS design is provided in Setion .

6.3 SUDS DESIGN CHARACTERISTICS TO SUPPORT BIODIVERSITY
This section presents a summary of the design characteristics that will contribute to the delivery of
biodiversity value for a SuDS scheme. Further information can be found in Graham et al (2012). The
focus here is on wet and planted features. However, there will be biodiversity value associated with other
surface types, eg gravel, aggregate, grit and mulch, particularly for insects and spiders.
6.3.1 Structural variability
A SuDS scheme should include both horizontal and vertical structural variability. This can be achieved in
the following ways:
z Use a variety of SuDS components and combine these with the natural longitudinal gradients
required for conveying water through the landscape.
z Use excavated topsoil and subsoil from the site by forming banks, mounds and terraces to provide
mosaics of permanently wet, temporarily wet and dry features that will aid the development of
a wide range of habitats. For example, hummocky margins in shallow water can mimic natural
wetland habitats.
z When designing pond and wetland features, use the sequence of riparian dry-level bench (required
for safety and maintenance access), gentle slopes, wet shallow safety bench, shallow and possibly
deeper water zones to help to deliver a physically and ecologically diverse landscape.
z Use variations in topography to protect ecologically valuable features from insensitive mowing
regimes by providing a physical constraint.
z Avoid smooth finished surfaces commonly seen in ditch and drain edges, retaining walls etc, as
these “tidy” edges do not encourage habitat development.

6.3.2 Biodiverse planting
A SuDS scheme should include a diverse range of planting. Biodiversity can be enhanced in the
following ways:
z Use planting of known wildlife value, wherever possible, that is appropriate to the location.
z Never introduce invasive species.
z Wherever possible, maximise the use of plants that are native and of local provenance, appropriate
to the region and suited to local soils and hydrology. Non-native plants can be considered in formal
situations, such as rain gardens adjacent to habitation.
Chapter 6: Designing for biodiversity
89
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
z Where non-native plants are used, only use plants of high nectar and aesthetic value. They should
not be invasive, or liable to spread into and impact on important sensitive habitats, or dominate the
planting scheme in which they have been included.
z Choose species which, when planted together, maximise all-year-round leaf coverage, flowering and
fruiting periods to provide food and shelter for invertebrates and birds.
z Allow natural colonisation by plants and animals of desired/intended species to take place during the
SuDS establishment process.
z Provide a variety of heights of grasses throughout the site, as wildlife will utilise grasses of different
heights in a variety of ways (Box 6.2).
z Encourage flowers into grasslands (by natural colonisation, seeding or planting), as these provide
nectar for a variety of insects.
z Consider planting gravel surfaces with nectar-rich plants, tolerant of drought, foot and vehicle
damage, for example chamomile and thyme.
z Where SuDS components require 100% vegetation cover before the system is commissioned (eg
swales) which means that turfing is essential, use flower-rich turf or add wildflower plugs to standard turf.
z Where necessary, use turfs that can withstand high flows and extended periods of waterlogging.
z Include trees, scrub and wet woodland features. These can increase habitats for amphibians and
invertebrates and provide some valuable shaded areas. Appropriate management of these areas will
be required to ensure that the intended biodiversity is retained.
z Maximise opportunities for providing or retaining dead wood in dry or wet areas. Dead and decaying
wood is valuable for mosses, lichen and fungi. It is also particularly important for invertebrates, as
many species rely on it for completing all or part of their life cycles. Standing deadwood can also
provide cavities for birds and bats for breeding and roosting.
See Chapter 29 for further guidance on planting.
Box
6.2
The importance of grasslands
Grasslands are particularly important for wildlife. For example
Birds and mammals will forage for seeds and insects in different lengths of grass.
Taller grasses will help retain humidity and soil moisture, which will in turn benefit soil invertebrates.
Longer swards provide somewhere for the eggs, pupae or larvae of some insects to over-winter
in the grass thatch. They will also be used by bumble bees for nesting.
Beneath trees and adjacent to shrubs, invertebrates that feed in the trees and bushes can
pupate in the grass to complete their life cycle.
Flying insects may shelter in longer grass during rain or sudden changes in temperature and
roost overnight.
Reptiles and amphibians will search for insects in longer grass and use it as cover when moving
between sites.
6.3.3 Biodiverse water features
A SuDS scheme should include biodiverse and resilient water features. These can be achieved in the
following ways:
z Manage the risk of toxic, pathogenic or otherwise harmful substances and silts that can smother
wildlife being discharged into the water feature (Chapter 4).
z Where possible, retain existing habitats and incorporate these into the landscape design, and locate
SuDS near to less intensively managed landscapes that are near to (but not connected to) natural
ponds and wetlands.
90 Part B: Philosophy and approach
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
z Maximise shallow and occasionally inundated areas of emergent pond vegetation, as these habitats
are more resistant to pollution than submerged areas, and they have high ecological value.
z Where possible, design the system so that some ones are not exposed to every runoff event and/or
are fed from a separate runoff source that is as clean as possible, such as roof water.
z Where appropriate, create shallow grassy wet areas along dry swales and basins, particularly towards
their downstream ends, where the water should be cleanest. These can be as small as 1–2 m wide
and 100 mm deep. Shallow scrapes, linked with sinuous surface channels of varying width will
increase opportunities for wildlife and slow water flows.

The SuDS design process
This chapter sets out the stages of the SuDS design process, from early
consideration of the strategic objectives for a development through
to detailed design. The process is relevant for new development,
redevelopment infill or retrofit SuS sites with the level of detail and
relevance of certain stages determined by the development type, size
and complexity. A step-by-step guide to carrying out each of the design
stages is provided, linking design criteria and standards to guidance on
design methods.
The SuDS design criteria and standards referred to in this chapter are presented in
Chapters 3–6.
Guidance on design methods is provided in Chapters 24–26.
Appendix C presents the design phases for a hypothetical SuDS scheme,
demonstrating the design process (as described in this chapter) and the detailed
hydraulic and treatment design of individual components.
7.1 INTRODUCTION
The SuDS design process should begin as early as possible in the feasibility stages
of a development project and, wherever possible, should be a consideration before
land purchase. Where SuDS form part of the initial development vision, character and
layout, they can provide a range of creative opportunities – using water to shape and
enhance development space and maximise the functionality, value and desirability of
the development.
The SuDS design process broadly follows four stages, as shown in Figure 7.1, and
details of the tasks involved are set out in Sections 7.5 to 7.8. Further detail on the
application of each of these stages can be found in AECOM (201).
Figure 7.1 The four stages of SuDS design
Chapter 7: The SuDS design process
95
7.2 96 CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
The SuDS design process is part of a much larger design process for the development as a whole and
will therefore be influenced by the progress of the overall project. This means that there may be the need
for iteration between stages, while the overall development and individual building designs progress
alongside the SuDS design. For example, the layout of the system conceived at conceptual design stage
may need to be reviewed once the preliminary SuDS component siing has been carried out and as the
overall layout for the site is refined.
The guidance in this chapter is most relevant for new development or redevelopment projects, although
retrofit considerations are referenced. Detailed guidance on the design process and implementation
mechanisms for retrofitting SuDS is provided in CIRIA C71 (Digman et al, 2012).
SUDS AND THE PLANNING SYSTEM
7.2.1 Integrating SuDS design and land use planning processes
The land use planning system controls development and use of land in the public interest at different
scales. It is a plan-led system, requiring forward planning through development plans, and it gives local
authority development plan policies pre-eminence in the determination of applications for planning
permissions. This permission is required for all development, as defined in various planning Acts and
Regulations.
Local criteria relevant to SuDS may be set via a local planning authority’s adopted planning instruments
(including flooding and planning documents) and via standards set by drainage approving and/or adoption
bodies (which may also refer to national standards where these exist). Both need to be checked before
design starts, to ensure that designs are fully compliant with relevant requirements. Water management
is an important planning consideration for any new development or redevelopment, with flooding,
climate resilience, community value and changes to biodiversity and landscape being relevant material
considerations, among others. SuDS can deliver benefits to, and be implemented at, a wide range of
scales (from catchments to buildings) and the level of associated planning should be proportionate.
Guidance on the incorporation of SuDS requirements into local spatial planning documents is provided in
CIRIA C67 (Dickie et al, 2010) and University of Cambridge (201).
The alignment and integration of the planning and drainage design process stages is set out in Figure 7.2.
For large sites, conceptual design is likely to form part of development master planning (Section 7.2.3),
but for smaller sites, formal master planning may not be required. Outline designs will usually be required
where outline planning permission is sought, and detailed design will be required for full planning
permission. If outline planning permission is not a requirement for the development, then outline and
detailed design would normally be undertaken as a single stage. The process steps described for outline
design (Section 7.7), however, will still need to be carried out.
7.2.2 The importance of pre-application discussions
Pre-application discussions between planners and developers (or their consultants) is normally a
requirement of the planning and/or drainage approval process particularly for larger sites. It is highly
recommended for all sites. These discussions can help significantly in ensuring that the expectations and
objectives for the surface water management system, including approval and adoption requirements, are
set out at an early stage in the design of development layouts and characteristics. This will also help to
ensure that space is used as efficiently and cost-effectively as possible, and will maximise the benefits
that can be achieved through effective integration of water management within the development.
In parallel with this, it is also advisable to have early engagement with the affected stakeholders (Section 7.3).
Suggested material for discussion at pre-application stage is set out in Appendix B (Section
B.1.1, Table B.1).
Part C: Applying the approach
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Figure 7.2 The drainage system design process links with land use planning
7.2.3 Conceptual SuDS within development master planning
A master plan is an overarching planning document and spatial layout that is used to structure future land
use and development. Its scope can range from a ten-year implementation strategy at the regional scale
to an illustrative plan of a small-scale group of buildings. It provides a crucial opportunity for SuDS to be
linked with a wide range of other development objectives (demonstrating the potential benefits and multi-
functionality of SuDS components at this early stage) and for this to be recognised in the business plan
for the development. Although some developments may be large enough to require master planning for
preliminary planning approval or material change of use, there is often no formal requirement, and every
design team will have its own individual approach (AECOM, 201).
Chapter 7: The SuDS design process
97
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Master planning is a collaborative process that provides the strategic framework for considering the
whole range of requirements and objectives for a development and how they might be delivered. It
should be a holistic framework within which all relevant stakeholders can contribute and work together
in creating high-quality places’ for future generations. It creates the opportunity for the use and
management of rainwater and surface runoff to be fully considered in a strategic and collaborative way
by drainage engineers, urban designers, highway engineers, architects, landscape architects, ecologists
and community stakeholders (Section 7.3). For large sites, the design team will benefit from inputs from
all these disciplines as the drainage concepts evolve. For small sites, inputs should be sought where
necessary. There are many examples of master plans where surface water management has been
used to structure and frame the development (eg Ashton Green, Leicester (Atlas, 2012) and North West
Cambridge (University of Cambridge, 2015).
To maximise the value of water to all stakeholders and to deliver the most efficient and cost-effective
design solutions, water management should be considered at all design scales. It should influence and
enhance individual building form and performance, and then connect plot-level management components
into the wider strategic drainage network and landscape setting. By bringing together SuDS with building,
urban, service delivery and landscape design and form, designers can achieve a water-sensitive urban
design perspective (Abbott et al, 201).
7.2.4 The challenges of delivering SuDS for phased developments
On large sites where development may be completed in phases, there will need to be a strategic site
surface water management system that allows different parts of the site to be developed at different
times, while ensuring that each of the design criteria can continue to be met. This strategic system should
be designed to manage the flows from the final developed site, and specific conditions will need to be set
for each development plot so that the original design assumptions are not invalidated. Delivery of each of
the design criteria should be considered at both a site level and a plot level to maximise the benefits and
to reduce risks associated with non-development or substantially delayed development.
Consideration should be given to the relative benefits associated with providing strategic storage versus
higher levels of plot-based storage or a combination of both. The adoption arrangements for elements of
the strategic system that may lie outside the phase being developed will also require careful consideration
and facilitation. Relevant catchment or sub-catchment planning strategies may determine where off-
site or strategic drainage components are required or proposed, and their design characteristics.
Consideration should also be given as to any specific requirements for pollution prevention strategies
(affecting either the development design or future operational strategies) to manage pollution risks. This is
usually most relevant for industrial sites.
Guidance on pollution prevention strategies is provided in Chapter 27.
7.2.5 SuDS design and the Environmental Impact Assessment
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is the process by which the anticipated effects on the
environment of a proposed development or project are measured. If the likely effects are unacceptable,
the EIA will suggest design measures or other relevant mitigation measures to reduce or avoid those
effects (eg pollution prevention strategies Chapter 27). An EIA may not be required for smaller
development sites.
The EIA may evaluate many of the strategic objectives for the site (Section 7.5) and may also undertake
a number of the site and development characterisation steps required as part of the surface water
management system conceptual design (Section 7.6). Where an EIA is available, it is likely to be a very
valuable reference source for the SuDS designer particularly the sections covering water resources and
flood risk, water quality management, biodiversity, climate resilience, landscape, development character
and visual amenity. SuDS may be highlighted in the EIA as a potential means of addressing some of the
environmental impacts caused by the development.

7.3 7.4 CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
7.2.6 SuDS design and the Flood Risk/Consequence Assessment
The Flood Risk Assessment (FRA) or Flood Consequence Assessment (FCA) for the site may be
undertaken at a similar time to conceptual SuDS design. Delivering conceptual SuDS design as part of
the FRA/FCA outputs will tend to make the design process more efficient and integrated, and produce the
best outcomes. The FRA/FCA will identify key areas of the site that may or may not be suitable for SuDS
components, and will also establish any flood haards for the operation and performance of the drainage
system. The FRA/FCA should also identify any specific requirements for surface water management on
the site required by catchment- or sub-catchment-scale flood risk management strategies.
More detail on assessing the impact of pre-development flood risk and the potential impact on surface
water management system design is provided in BS 52201.
SUDS DESIGN AND STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT
Successful delivery of SuDS often depends on co-ordination and communication between the developer/
designer and a range of external stakeholders including local authority departments such as planning,
drainage and flooding, ecology, open-space management and highways as well as environmental
regulators, water and sewerage undertakers, local community group representatives, residents’
organisations and other private sector stakeholders.
There is a need for stakeholder involvement throughout the process of surface water management
system design. The land-use planning process should be used to bring together the views of both
statutory and non-statutory consultees with other interested parties, such as non-governmental
organisations and the general public. This provides a mechanism for planners and environmental
regulators to engage with others on SuDS – raising awareness, educating developers and promoting
community interaction and learning opportunities.
For retrofit schemes, stakeholder engagement can facilitate potential partnership funding opportunities,
where benefits from the scheme will accrue to multiple stakeholders, and this can help with securing
the most cost-effective and highest quality schemes. The design process for such schemes should
also encourage and involve local communities the most successful outcomes will be delivered where
communities can (because of effective education and awareness raising) act as a client’ and contributor’,
understanding the role and opportunities of rainwater and surface water management in the landscape.
Engagement with the local community (whether this is with neighbouring inhabitants for new
developments or current residents for retrofit sites) should be part of both the land use planning
and SuDS design processes. There are many different engagement processes that can be used (ie
inform, consult, involve, collaborate, empower), but most will include an element of education and
awareness-raising. Understanding will tend to foster an appreciation of the role and benefits of SuDS in
environmental protection, and an enhanced sense of responsibility for their upkeep and protection.
Guidance on working with communities is provided in Chapter 34.
STAGE 1: SETTING STRATEGIC SWM OBJECTIVES
The first stage of the SuDS design process is the setting of the strategic surface water management
(SWM) objectives for the development.
Consultation with relevant stakeholders (Section 7.3) and reference to adopted local planning and
regulatory guidance, policy (Section 7.2.1) and the site Environmental Impact Assessment (Section
7.2.5) and flood risk/consequence assessment (where available see Section 7.2.6) should establish
relevant local or site-specific strategic objectives including
flood risk management objectives
Chapter 7: The SuDS design process
99
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
water quality management objectives
community, social and amenity planning objectives
habitat and biodiversity strategy requirements and needs
viable long-term maintenance bodies for the proposed SuDS and any relevant SuDS adoption
requirements (eg standards, criteria and/or guidance)
climate change adaptation/climate resilience requirements and needs
water supply objectives and constraints.
Early consideration of surface water management will provide designers with the opportunity to use
SuDS that respond to the local context and character, enriching both the natural and built environment.
By fully integrating the management of surface water with the wider development objectives and by
considering all space as potentially multi-functional, surface water management systems can be used
to enhance development viability by delivering the design criteria described in Chapters 3–6. This can
result in a range of benefits, such as
an alternative water resource to improve future water security
higher value amenity, recreation and education facilities within public open space
improved habitats and biodiversity
improved climate resilience for the development
reduced pressure on sewerage infrastructure and reduced surface water flooding
a natural structure’ to the layout of the site where transport routes, public open space and buildings
are aligned with flow conveyance routes, and public open space is integrated with green and blue
flow storage and treatment components
a mechanism for enhancing and defining the quality, character and visual aesthetics of both the built
environment and green/open space
a surface water management system that can be easily and cost-effectively maintained.
General guidance on using SuDS to deliver multiple benefits can be found in Chapter 1.
Guidance on opportunities for multi-functionality can be found in Chapters 5 and 10.
Guidance on delivering water quantity, water quality, amenity and biodiversity benefits can be
found in Chapters 3–6 respectively.
Guidance on assessing the value of benefits can be found in Chapter 35.
7.5 STAGE 2: CONCEPTUAL DESIGN
The second stage of the SuDS design process is the conceptual design. The key outcome of this stage
is to identify and assess potential SuDS components and linkages, in developing Management Trains for
each area of the site.
The conceptual design stage process is shown in Figure 7.3 and described in the sections below.

Define site and deeoment harateristis
It is important to assess the site for the SuDS scheme before design begins. Where SuDS are to be
retrofitted, this should include existing roof areas, hard surfaces, green spaces and land ownership
boundaries, in order to make the best use of the space.
This step has two elements:
characterisation of the site – development of an understanding of relevant features of the site and
the surrounding area that could influence the SuDS design criteria and design options
characterisation of the development – development of an understanding of relevant features of
the proposed development that could influence the SuDS design criteria and design options.
Site characterisation covers an assessment of:
1 site topography
2 existing flow routes and discharge points
potential for infiltration
4 potential for surface water discharge
5 site flood risks
6 existing site land use
7 existing site infrastructure (above and below ground)

Development characterisation covers an assessment of:
11 proposed topography, land use and landscape characteristics
12 proposed flood risk management strategy
1 proposed site infrastructure
1 proposed building style and form
15 proposed adoption and maintenance of the surface water management system.
Each of these subjects is discussed in the sections below.
1 Site topography
o the site contours mean that flow paths will naturally occur in particular locations
Are there any lowlying areas where water will naturally accumulate
Are there any particularly flat or steep parts of the site
Topography is a good indication of existing natural drainage pathways and will often help define
appropriate natural routes for the surface runoff to follow, in order to efficiently drain the site from higher
to lower levels using surface gradients, without relying on extra infrastructure or pumping.
Particularly steep slopes may not be suitable for conveyance routes, without measures to reduce
gradients and/or flow velocities, and the siting of storage systems on slopes may require embankments,
which should be avoided where possible.
Identification of low-lying areas will demonstrate where water will naturally accumulate, and these may be
good locations for siting storage areas. Local historical knowledge and records of surface flooding will be
valuable for this process.
Guidance on designing for both sloping and very flat sites is provided in Sections 8.4 and 8.5
respectively.
istin o routes and dishare oints
ow is the site currently drained
hat are the existing flow paths across the site
The natural drainage pattern for the site and existing flow paths and discharge points should be
established (as illustrated in Figure 7.4) and an assessment made as to how these are likely to be
modified by development. This is determined largely by topography and ground conditions, together with
a review of historical drainage measures that have modified the original drainage pattern including land
drainage, culverts and sewer networks. Current discharge points (whether to groundwater, surface waters
or sewerage systems) should be established and characterised.

Singleton Hill is a development that considered drainage from the outset of the master plan. As
a result, buildings were designed around the existing drainage routes. Maintaining these natural
flow routes eliminated the need to engineer conveyance routes. The main drainage channels were
developed as a greenway for pedestrian and cycle access through the development to a local
commercial area. This makes walking and cycling safer on the development and reduces car usage
by residents and visitors.

(*If the area over which infiltration is taking place is large and at shallow depth, and providing the SuDS
allow evaporation of water, then the risk is often no greater than that posed by an area of grass.)
The site area should be characterised in terms of the potential for infiltration (eg good/poor/not possible).
This will identify areas where infiltration within the site can potentially be used as a method of disposing
of surface water runoff, areas where infiltration can be used to deliver Interception (using low infiltration
capacities), and areas where infiltration cannot or should not occur.
Guidance on the potential constraints to the use of infiltration and infiltration testing methods is
provided in Section 25.2.
Guidance on sites with high groundwater levels, contaminated soils or groundwater is provided in
Sections 8.2 and 8.3.
Guidance on the need to deliver Interception is provided in Sections 3.2.3 and 3.3.1 and
Sections 4.2.2 and 4.3.1.
Guidance on designing Interception is provided in Section 24.8.
4 Potential for surface water discharge
hat options are there regarding discharge destinations
Local surface waters that may be suitable for discharge of runoff should be evaluated in terms of their
capacity, existing flood risk and any environmental or use designations. These will influence the viability
of possible discharges and (when considered together with land use) provide an indication of the level
of runoff treatment that might be required. If the SuDS are likely to discharge to a surface or combined
sewer, then the surface waters receiving discharges from the sewerage system should be assessed.
Where discharges are proposed to existing sewers, early consultation should be undertaken with the
relevant sewerage undertaker. Rights to discharge to any receiving watercourse should be established
early in the design process, and the relevant stakeholders engaged appropriately.
Guidance on prioritising where surface water runoff is discharged is provided in Section 3.2.3.

CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Pre-development flood risk should be established by the flood risk/consequence assessment for the site, which
should have been considered during stage 1 (Setting strategic SWM objectives) but should be revisited here.
An assessment needs to be made of the extent to which the identified flood risk could impact on or
be impacted by any site surface water management system. Consideration should be given to fluvial,
coastal, groundwater, and surface water flood risks on the site, before the proposed development.
Guidance on managing on-site flood risk is provided in Sections 3.2.6 and 3.3.3.
Guidance on SuDS in floodplains is provided in Section 8.8.
6 Existing site land use
ow is the site currently used and will this continue after development for retrofit schemes
What opportunities are there to use the site more effectively for surface water management (for
retrofit schemes
How will the use of the site before the development impact on the extent to which runoff needs to be
managed by the SuS for the proposed site
Where looking to retrofit SuDS, site surveys and community engagement can help to understand how the
space is currently used.
Where the site has been developed previously (ie redevelopment sites), there should always be an
aspiration to manage runoff to represent greenfield characteristics. This will help reduce any receiving
watercourse flood risk (both now and under future climate change scenarios), thus contributing to more
sustainable development. However, it is recognised that redevelopment sites tend to be more constrained
in terms of space and infiltration may be more restricted, so drainage approving bodies (in conjunction
with the environmental regulator) may agree that reductions to an agreed proportion of the previously
developed rates/volumes are acceptable.
7 Existing site infrastructure
hat is the location depth and capacity of existing drainage
here are existing services located including depth
Are there any existing uniue assets in the streets eg sewer vent
Are there any flood ris management assets on the site
When building on brownfield or pre-developed sites, existing on-site infrastructure should be
documented and mapped. It is important to understand the location and capacity of existing drainage,
to determine what infrastructure could or should be reused in the SuDS scheme. Some of these
features may have byelaws associated with them, and this should be checked at an early stage, along
with any associated implications. Other buried infrastructure, such as utilities and other services, need
to be located and considered particularly with respect to access for inspection and maintenance.
Existing services can sometimes be diverted (although this is usually only possible for larger sites), and
this option can also be considered.
Asset databases of buried infrastructure available from utility providers or the local authority should not
be considered as definitive and should be checked with surveys.
For sites where there is congestion of buried services (most common for retrofit sites), a specialist
company should be employed to carry out a survey of buried services before starting any design.
Registered flood risk management assets should be identified from the local flood authority, and any
interaction with the proposed drainage system should be considered and managed appropriately.
Chapter 7: The SuDS design process
105
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
8 Existing soils
s the existing soil on the site suitable for use in SuS design
An assessment should be carried out of the existing topsoil and subsoils on site, so that their suitability for
reuse on the site can be determined and the handling and management of these soils can be carried out
appropriately (Section 29.3.3). It may be appropriate for this to be undertaken by a qualified soil scientist.
9 Local habitats and biodiversity
hich habitat types and species of flora and fauna are or were historically prevalent in the area
Are there any locally important habitats and how are these connected
s there a local biodiversity strategy
Existing site habitats should be characterised so that consideration can be given to which species of
flora and fauna might be able to exploit new habitat potentially created by the SuDS scheme. This should
normally be undertaken by an ecologist and should be documented within an ecological report for the
site. The Chartered Institute of Ecology and Environmental Management provides a comprehensive
source of guidance on species survey methods and ecological impact assessment techniques.
Existing and historic locally important habitats (eg marshland, ponds/wetlands, grasslands, riparian
corridors) should be evaluated in order that they are supported and/or recreated where valuable and
appropriate. Understanding existing habitat areas and how these are connected (or could be connected)
will help to determine the extent to which the new SuDS might be able to enhance local ecological
networks and corridors. Local biodiversity strategies should have been considered during stage 1 (setting
strategic SWM objectives) but should be revisited at this stage.
Guidance on supporting and protecting natural local habitats and species, delivering local
biodiversity objectives and creating habitat connectivity is provided in Chapter 6.
10 Local landscape and townscape
Are there any conservation designations or planning constraints for the site that will affect the SuS design
hat are the existing green or blue assets on or near the site eg pars playgrounds rivers laes canals
What are the potential climate change pressures for the area (eg urban heat island effect, water
scarcity
Existing local landscape and townscape characteristics will help define
the likely suitability and detailing of different SuDS components
the likely value of green and blue space, and natural assets (this may be a function of local housing
densities)
potential climate change pressures (eg urban heat island effects, water scarcity)
climatic characteristics (eg is the area naturally dry or wet)
the relationship between existing development and any common local water features.
Landscape character assessments (Tudor, 201) can be used to help support this characterisation process.
Planning and conservation designations for the local area may also be relevant to SuDS design and
should have been considered during stage 1 (setting strategic SWM objectives) but should be revisited
at this stage.
106 Part C: Applying the approach
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Guidance on landscape character is provided in Section 29.2.
Guidance on enhancing visual character is provided in Section 5.2.3.
Guidance on designing SuDS within the context of existing urban areas is provided in Chapter 10.
11 Proposed topography, land use and landscape characteristics

s the proposed topography liely to present challenges
hat are the proposed land uses for the site
hat are the landscape reuirements for the site
hat will be the building density for the development
ow will the site be used and maintained
ow could locally important habitats be connected
Any substantive changes to the topography required by the development will need to be taken into account,
including any land raising required for flood risk management or contaminated land remediation purposes.
Where the topography is likely to provide particular challenges for the implementation of a surface water
management system, consideration should be given to whether any beneficial changes could be made.
The extent of the development, likely building density, proposed land uses across the site, and the
proposed landscape strategy will be key influences on the overall surface water management design
philosophy. They will define the mix of impermeable and permeable surfaces to be drained or used for
drainage, they will define the likely pollution haard posed, and they will have a strong influence on the
suitability of different SuDS components. Any pollution prevention strategies proposed for the site should
be considered in terms of any potential impact on water-quality risk management for the site.
External landscape requirements (eg car parks and urban squares), amenity and recreation areas (eg
sports fields and playgrounds) and other public open space planned for the site should be evaluated so
that, where possible, it can be integrated with surface water management systems to deliver open space
that is multi-functional and of high amenity and biodiversity value. Natural flow paths and manmade
connection routes (eg roads, cycle paths and green corridors) are likely to be of particular importance
in structuring a potential network for runoff conveyance and storage through the site. Consultation with
stakeholders will be required to establish appropriate ownership and maintenance strategies for multi-
functional land.
The characteristics of likely vehicle usage (including types of vehicles and likely speeds) on the site will
be important. This can influence the type of surfacing and sub-base that might be suitable, the extent
and location of parking requirements at roadsides (this may influence options for managing road runoff),
the likely requirements for traffic calming measures and roundabouts (and the potential for integrating
these with SuDS), and the potential for using roads as surface water runoff exceedance routes. Any
requirements for special accessibility requirements, such as dropped kerbs, disabled parking or access
for sweeping and/or winter gritting machines, may also impact on SuDS design and detailing.
An understanding should be developed of how the aesthetic appeal and tranquillity of diverse vegetated
green spaces and open water features could add character and help create a sense of place, give the
community a healthy outdoor environment that encourages outdoor activity and enjoyment and provide
space where children can play and learn about water and the water environment.
Community engagement can provide valuable information regarding the community’s aspirations for
future use and the opportunities and constraints for SuDS, such as potential traffic calming measures and
car parking requirements.
Chapter 7: The SuDS design process

The potential use of underutilised land should be discussed with the appropriate landowners and tenants,
with respect to making hard surfaces permeable, improving the landscaping or green infrastructure
provision, or using the land directly as part of the surface water management strategy.
Guidance on designing SuDS to suit the proposed land use is provided in Chapter 10 (in
particular see the typologies in Section 10.3).
Guidance on enhancing visual character and supporting community environmental learning is
provided in Sections 5.2.3 and 5.2.7.
Guidance on the likely pollution haard associated with different land use types and the potential
implications for SuDS design is provided in Sections 4.2.2 and 4.3.2 and Chapter 26.
Guidance on community engagement is provided in Chapter 34.
roosed ood ris manaement strate
ow could surface water management for the site be affected by or affect the flood ris
management strategy
An assessment needs to be made of the extent to which any identified flood risk mitigation strategies
established by the FRA/FCA could impact on or be impacted by any site surface water management system.
This should have been considered during stage 1 (setting strategic SWM objectives) but should be revisited at
this stage.
Guidance on managing on-site flood risk is provided in Sections 3.2.6 and 3.3.3.
Guidance on SuDS in floodplains is provided in Section 8.8.
13 Proposed site infrastructure
ow could the proposed site infrastructure be affected by or affect the scheme design
here are existing and planned services located including depth
an existing services be diverted usually only possible for larger sites
an planned services be designed to fit around the SuS
Any planned subsurface or surface infrastructure (including proposed services) for the development should
be mapped and evaluated to determine the potential impact on SuDS layout and design. Where SuDS are
considered early in the development design process, there may be the flexibility to route planned services
around SuDS locations.
14 Proposed building use, style and form
How can the architecture and building design assist, improve and be part of surface water
management eg green roofs
How can drivers and opportunities for building-scale rainwater harvesting (RWH) systems facilitate
the use of R system storage for surface water management
ow might water features best be used in the context of the proposed building use style and form
How can water be conveyed from roofs and impermeable surfaces to SuDS components (downspouts, rain
chains etc
ow can water enrich urban spaces and building fabric
How can the surface water management system help secure climate adaptability and resilience
for the buildings (through securing a more sustainable water supply, providing urban shade, extra
insulation and cooling etc
10 Part C: Applying the approach
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Understanding the proposed building types, density, quality, character, style and any applicable sustainability
targets (eg DCLG, 200) will maximise the benefits for the development.
At the building scale, SuDS are increasingly being seen as part of the fabric of buildings, for example, as
landscapes, green walls and roofs, and as the key purpose of internal courtyards. Not only does this enhance the
aesthetic quality of the buildings, but it brings among other things, climate and internal air quality benefits.
Guidance on maximising multi-functionality and supporting development resilience/adaptability to future
change (including climate change) is provided in Sections 5.2.2 and 5.2.5.
Guidance on green roofs is provided in Chapter 12.
Guidance on RWH systems is provided in Chapter 11.
15 Proposed adoption and maintenance
ho will have final ownership or adopt the SuS
hat approval criteria and processes will be set by the owneradoption body
ho will be responsible for future maintenance of the SuS
hat is the liely level of maintenance
Agreement on the organisation that will take long-term responsibility for the ownership and maintenance of the
SuDS should have been established when the SWM objectives for the site were defined. Any remaining uncertainty
should be removed at this stage, because without a confirmed adoption body, the proposed scheme (and thus
development) will not be viable.
The adoption body may have independent approval criteria and processes, and these should be clearly understood
by the designer, and evaluated for potential impacts on the design.
The body may also have their own protocols on the level of maintenance that they will provide for schemes, and this
should also be given full consideration in the design.
Where SuDS are proposed in public open space, it will be necessary to ensure that the design meets the
requirements of the local authority. Consideration needs to be given to the responsibilities for maintenance of any
public open space where the primary function will be other than surface water management. For example, as part
of the design of detention basins or exceedance storage areas that have an amenity use, a decision will need to be
made regarding optimum maintenance for surface water management versus the designated amenity use.
7.5.2 Establish SuDS design criteria
A suite of SuDS design criteria should be developed for the SuDS scheme that
1 aims to deliver on each of the criteria set out in the individual criteria chapters to the maximum extent practical
for the site:
water quantity (Chapter 3)
water quality (Chapter 4)
amenity (Chapter 5)
biodiversity (Chapter 6)
(Note the standards set out in Chapters 3 and 4 should be met in full, unless there are local or national standards
that take precedence).
2 takes account of the strategic surface water management objectives established for the site (Section 7.5)
takes account of the opportunities, challenges and constraints identified by the site and development

It may be useful to develop some indicators (suggested in the criteria chapters) for each of the criteria that
can be used as a means of later assessing the extent to which each of the criteria are met by the as-designed
Identify feasible points of discharge
The destination for surface water runoff should be prioritised, as defined in Section 3.2.3.
Checks should be made of any potential receiving surface waters environmental designations and
discharge constraints and consents.
Where discharges to sewers are being considered, the sewerage undertaker should be consulted so that
the designer understands the likely available sewer capacity and opportunities and/or constraints with
respect to any potential connections.
Guidance on prioritising where surface water runoff is discharged is provided in Section 3.2.3
Guidance on the potential constraints to the use of infiltration and infiltration testing methods is
provided in Section 25.2.
Define surfae ater subathments and o routes
Flow routes and development clusters should be used to define surface water sub-catchments,
particularly on larger sites (Figure 7.6). These will then form discrete drainage areas, each with their own
drainage characteristics with the runoff from them then conveyed downstream to the drainage outfall. The
definition of sub-catchments and flow routes is therefore a linked process.
Figure 7.6 Defining surface water sub-catchments
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
It is often sensible to cluster land use types, as these will tend to have different requirements with respect
to treatment (Section 4.3.2). Each sub-catchment should deliver Interception for the impermeable
areas and should, where possible, treat the runoff and provide a degree of flow and volume control
(using infiltration where practical). For large events, it may be appropriate to allow runoff to bypass sub-
catchment controls to reach larger storage structures further downstream.
Where appropriate, planned parks and open spaces should be located at the downstream end of sub-
catchments to provide space for larger-scale, surface water attenuation and controls (as illustrated in
Figure 7.7).
Flow routes can often form part of open space corridors and be used to help link existing habitat ones
with biodiverse pathways. Surface water conveyance paths should work with the topography to safely and
effectively direct surface water to the desired locations, while simultaneously delivering integrated storage
and treatment wherever possible. Water should be kept at or near the surface (ie not, where possible,
in pipes), reducing the need for deep excavations and helping deliver all the benefits associated with
surface systems.
Figure 7.7 Defining parks, open spaces and corridors
If appropriate and practicable, configuration of the major road network and development blocks should
also be defined by sub-catchment boundaries within the site (as illustrated in Figure 7.8). The street
network should be structured to complement and manage flow pathways by
integrating SuDS components into street cross-sections, ensuring street widths are adequate
using SuDS to improve the streetscape, providing multi-functionality by integrating with other street
features including tree planting, traffic calming, parking bays, verges and central reservations
making best use of available space to accommodate a wider range of depths, widths and profiles,
where feasible.
Chapter 7: The SuDS design process
111
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Figure 7. Defining the road network
If there are adopted roads as part of the development, then consultation with the highways authority
needs to be undertaken early in the design process, in order that acceptable highway drainage designs
can be developed, and any required integration of highway drainage systems with the drainage of other
parts of the site can be agreed.

Guidance on designing SuDS for roads is provided in Chapter 9.
Guidance on designing SuDS to work within a streetscape and delivering multi-functionality is
provided in Chapter 10.
7.5.5 Select SuDS components for the Management Train
The SuDS components selected will depend on the design criteria, and on how the surface water
management system is linked and integrated with the development and its landscape setting. Individual
components can be designed in a number of different ways both in a technical sense (eg the same
component can either be lined to prevent infiltration, or have a permeable base) and a visual sense
(components can be landscaped to look appropriate in a contemporary or more traditional setting).
Components can often be used to both convey and store runoff, usually depending on the sie of
the runoff event (eg swales). Table 7.1 summarises the likely potential of different SuDS components
in delivering the design criteria, and provides a design aid as the steps of component selection and
Management Train design are worked through as shown in Figure 7.9.

Establish methods of runoff collection from all site surfaces
There are many ways in which runoff can be efficiently collected from development surfaces
Surfaces can be made permeable (eg through the use of pervious surfaces, or by using green roofs).
The SuDS component can be designed to run alongside the impermeable surface so that runoff can
be discharged directly, for example onto a filter strip, swale or other surface channel.
Runoff can be diverted into conveyance or storage components using distributed collection methods,
for example kerb openings and gullies.
Guidance on inlet and outlet design is provided in Chapter 28.
11 Part C: Applying the approach
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Select Interception components for all hard surfaces
The first consideration in designing the SuDS Management Train for a site should be the delivery of
Interception for each impermeable area, wherever possible. Interception is delivered where SuDS
components are an integral part of the runoff surface or collection method (eg permeable pavements,
green roofs, rainwater harvesting systems), and in such scenarios, the surface may also be able to
provide Interception for adjacent runoff surfaces.
In areas where infiltration is possible, soakaways can be considered for roof water, and infiltration from
swales, bioretention areas, dry basins and permeable surfaces can be used to manage as much surface
water as possible (providing sufficient treatment is delivered before any discharge to groundwater). Where
infiltration is impractical or inappropriate, very low infiltration rates and/or depths of soil storage can often be
used for Interception, followed by conveyance to downstream attenuation and treatment components.
Guidance on the design of Interception is provided in Section 24.8.
Guidance on the design of infiltration components is provided in Chapter 25.
Guidance on the design of RWH systems is provided in Chapter 11.
Select storage components
There are likely to be a number of areas within the development that could potentially be combined with
the delivery of attenuation storage, for example beneath permeable paving or recreation facilities, within
small detention ones, ponds or channel conveyance routes. Distributing the storage areas across the
site within multi-functional spaces, can be effective in terms of land-take, potentially reducing the need for
a large downstream attenuation facility.
If rainwater harvesting and infiltration cannot be used on a site, there will be a need to manage the extra
volumes of runoff from the site in some other way. This extra volume can either be spilled from the main
drainage system into a separate storage area which is drained very slowly (this is termed Long-Term
Storage), or the extra volume can be incorporated into the main attenuation storage for the site (but this
is likely to substantially increase the required storage volumes). Long-Term Storage areas will only flood
infrequently, so can often be recreation or other amenity areas.
Very initial estimates of required storage areas are usually pragmatic at this stage. These can be done using
past experience, simple spreadsheet tools (that follow the processes set out in Chapters 24 and 25) or
using the tools on www.uksuds.com
Where the development is to be phased, storage should, where possible, be delivered on individual plots.
Where the SuDS design for individual plots relies on strategic storage, agreement on access, ownership
and maintenance of these elements needs agreement at an early stage of the design.
Guidance relating to the delivery of storage components is set out in Sections 3.2.3, 3.3.1 and 3.3.2.
Guidance on the design of attenuation and Long-Term Storage components is provided in
Sections 24.9 and 24.10.
Guidance on design of infiltration is provided in Chapter 25.
Select conveyance components to link Interception and storage components
As water is conveyed downstream, SuDS components should be linked using conveyance systems (eg
swales, linear wetlands, channels, rills, pipes), which themselves may provide useful treatment, infiltration
and/or storage.
Vegetated surface conveyance components will tend to deliver greater water quality, amenity and
biodiversity benefits. They can also form part of open space corridors along important drainage features,
and link existing habitat ones with biodiverse pathways.
Chapter 7: The SuDS design process
115
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
On steep sites, surface water conveyance routes will either need to be directed across the slope to reduce
gradients and minimise erosive velocities or other mechanisms will be needed to reduce gradients, such as
natural waterfalls, checkdams and baffles. Keeping water on the surface reduces the need for cover, which
can create requirements for very deep excavations for piped systems.
On flat sites, careful design will be required, to ensure that conveyance gradients do not mean that
downstream systems are very deep.

It is important that a SuDS scheme is developed with consideration of the pollution treatment
requirements of different land use areas. Areas of the site with low contamination potential will represent
opportunities for rainwater harvesting, and areas with low and medium contamination levels can usually
be safely infiltrated. It is vital to ensure that relatively clean runoff is not mixed with poorer-quality runoff,
thus rendering it less suitable for infiltration or harvesting. Where possible, different land uses (that
have different pollution potential) should be clustered, so that Management Trains can be designed
most efficiently. By implementing SuDS at a plot level, sources of pollution can be easily identified, and
remedial actions and maintenance work can be undertaken by the plot owner/operator. Agreed pollution
prevention strategies (eg specified as a condition of use) may influence the haard posed by particular
land use types, and these should be considered at this stage.
Sufficient treatment must be provided for both individual and/or combined sub-catchments, and an early
review of likely treatment requirements for different land uses on the site should be undertaken following
the design criteria in Chapter 4 and supporting guidance on design methods in Chapter 26. Where the
development is to be phased, the drainage of individual plots should not rely on drainage systems on
plots not yet developed to meet the standards and criteria set for the site. Where the development is to
be phased, water quality management should, where possible, be delivered on individual plots. Where
the SuDS design for individual plots relies on strategic treatment components, agreement on access,
ownership and maintenance needs agreement at an early stage of the design.
Guidance on pollution prevention strategies is provided in Chapter 27.
Guidance on the likely pollution haard associated with different land use types and the potential
implications for SuDS design is described in Sections 4.2.2 and 4.3.2 and Chapter 26.
Identify exceedance routes and storage locations
Safe exceedance routes and storage areas should be considered and integrated within the development
design (Figure 7.10). Exceedance routes can include roads on the site, and exceedance storage areas
can include car parks, recreation areas and other areas of public open space, as long as their use for this
purpose will not impede their normal function to the extent of putting people or vehicles at risk and that
they can be maintained in the long term. Appropriate legal permissions and requirements for use of the
land as an exceedance route should be sought at an early stage.

Guidance on designing SuDS for roads is provided in Chapter 9.
efine the anaement rain
Once the preliminary scheme has been designed for the site, the scheme as a whole should be reviewed
against the design criteria, potentially using indicators where these have been developed. Where the
design fails to meet the criteria, or benefits have not been maximised, SuDS components should be
revisited to determine if there are more appropriate alternatives or whether the components can be
designed in such a way as to increase their value to the development.
At this stage, rough initial estimates of likely scales of SuDS components may be useful to designers so
that adequate space for SuDS in the streetscape and public open space can be allowed for.
Consideration should also be given at this stage to any potential construction issues associated with the
selected components, and likely maintenance requirements (including access) to confirm the scheme’s
long-term viability.
Where development is to be phased, the SuDS design will need to take full account of this.
7.5.7 Conceptual design: Reporting
The reporting at this stage should set out the conceptual drainage strategy and confirm the approval and
adoption processes and stakeholders involved. The report should include
definition of strategic objectives for the development in relation to the management of surface water,
including any sustainability targets for water management, climate resilience, biodiversity, green
infrastructure etc for the development, FRA requirements, and local SuDS approval and adoption
policy requirements
Chapter 7: The SuDS design process
117
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
identification of likely synergies and challenges, such as potential contribution of the site surface
water management system to wider catchment objectives, such as biodiversity delivery and flood
risk management
any requirements/objectives imposed by a wider site surface water management strategy (ie where
the site is a parcel of land that forms part of a larger development area)
water quantity, water quality, amenity and biodiversity design criteria and standards relevant for the site
constraints and opportunities for SuDS delivery, including any likely change in permeability of the
site following development, proposed land use, site contamination levels, infiltration potential, public
open space/green space/amenity provision requirements, local biodiversity characteristics, building
types and forms, street types and forms
initial scoping of potential costs and benefits of different SuDS options, in order to estimate any
influence on development viability
the outputs of any initial stakeholder consultations and implications for SuDS design and community
engagement strategies
the definition of surface water sub-catchments, land use types, flow routes, runoff destinations and
Management Train options
design methods to be used (eg for greenfield or previously developed runoff rate assessments)
and justification
likely SuDS components and initial estimate of space required (including access for maintenance),
including the potential integration with the built form, connective pathways, green/public space
consideration of key construction and maintenance issues.
At this stage, it is crucial to secure a complete understanding as to who will be the long-term owner of the
drainage assets (some assets are likely to remain in private ownership, while others may be adopted by
public bodies) and who will operate and maintain the assets. This will dictate any site-specific adoption
criteria and also the required processes set by the relevant drainage adoption body.
Where the proposed system has operational requirements (eg pumping), the operation protocols and
emergency procedures will need evaluating and agreeing with the adoption body.
Even at early stages in the design, it is important to ensure that long-term maintenance is as cost-
effective as possible, and that any future owner will have easy access to all parts of the drainage system
that may require future maintenance, and any equipment and skills required to undertake the work.
Options for the disposal of waste (arising from sedimentation and vegetation management) should also
be considered.
Guidance on assessing potential costs and benefits of different SuDS options is provided in
Chapter 35.
Guidance on operation and maintenance requirements is provided in Chapter 32.
Guidance on waste management requirements is provided in Chapter 33.
Guidance on community engagement strategies is provided in Chapter 34.
7.6 STAGE 3: OUTLINE DESIGN
The third stage of the SuDS design is the outline design, which should be developed alongside the
agreed layout and design of the development, and landscape and building characteristics. Key steps in
outline design are shown in Figure 7.11 and described in the following sections.
11 Part C: Applying the approach
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Figure 7.11 The outline design process
Outline designs will usually be required where outline planning permission is sought. Where only a full
planning permission is sought, the stages involved here will still be required, but should be incorporated
into the detailed design stage (Section 7.8).
7.6.1 Size SuDS components at site scale
In order to further develop the SuDS design, estimates will be required for the following
the greenfield (and/or agreed proportion of previously developed) runoff rates, to which the runoff
from the site will need to be controlled
likely runoff rates from the developed sub-catchments (including any climate change and urban
creep provisions)
infiltration capacities where infiltration components are proposed
demand for non-potable water where rainwater harvesting components are proposed
the remaining difference in runoff volume between the development runoff volume and the greenfield
(or other agreed) runoff volume for a specified large event.
The required attenuation storage volume will be dependent on the increase in runoff rate because of the
development, and the design rainfall event characteristics.
This will allow initial siing calculations to be done of the
volumes assumed to be harvested for different return periods
volumes assumed to be infiltrated for different return periods
total attenuation storage volumes required for the site for different return periods
extra storage volumes likely to be required for volume control for the 1100 year event (ie Long-
Term Storage).

Guidance on attenuation storage design is presented in Section 24.9.
Guidance on Long-Term Storage design is presented in Section 24.10.
7.6.2 Develop design at sub-catchment scale
At this stage, the individual SuDS components should be sied, and their designs refined. Any
assumptions made at conceptual design stage, such as infiltration capacities, groundwater levels and
existing sewerage infrastructure and capacities, should be confirmed, using robust evaluation methods.
Required storage volumes should be distributed between sub-catchments (where appropriate), estimates
should be made of required conveyance and exceedance flow rates and checks should be made that
proposed treatment components are adequate. Any required flow control components should be defined
and scoped. This process is set out in Figure 7.12.

7.6.3 Check design feasibility
The constructability and maintainability of the proposed SuDS scheme should be given full consideration,
and initial construction and maintenance strategies developed for consideration by stakeholders.
A preliminary health and safety risk assessment should be developed. SuDS designs will require
consideration as part of any CDM risk assessment process.
Any requirements of the drainage approving body and other engaged stakeholders regarding design
detailing should be evaluated at this stage.
The costs of the scheme should be given full consideration and agreed with scheme funders, and
likely long-term operation and maintenance costs should be approved by the drainage adoption body
before final design. Where scheme investment is driven by benefits delivered by the scheme, benefit
quantification should also be undertaken.

provided in Appendix B (Section B.3, Table B.5).
Guidance on costing designs is provided in Chapter 35.
7.6.4 Outline design: Reporting
Reporting at this stage should be sufficient to support outline planning applications, and should include
preliminary siing for each component and exceedance flow management route. The outline design
statement should establish
points of discharge of the surface water runoff from the site
the extent to which each of the design criteria (quantity, quality, amenity and biodiversity) will be
delivered by the SuDS design, and the impact of any stakeholder engagement undertaken during
the design process
statements regarding how each of the criteria will be delivered by the system
a description and evaluation of proposed Interception measures for all impermeable areas
a suitable SuDS Management Train(s) for all sub-catchments that delivers appropriate treatment
infiltration tests (where practical or other infiltration assessments based on desk studies) and
approximate infiltration designs (where relevant)
approximate attenuation and Long-Term Storage volumes and appropriate flow control systems to
manage flows and volumes for different return periods, including design exceedance events

an operation and maintenance plan (that includes waste disposal).
A more formal list of requirements might be set by a drainage approving body at outline planning stage.
An example list of requirements for reporting is set out in Appendix B (Section B.1.2, Table B.2).
7.7 STAGE 4: DETAILED DESIGN
The fourth stage of the SuDS design is the detailed design, which should refine the SuDS design in line with
the final development design, and determine siing and detailing for final drawings and documentation to be
submitted for planning approval, drainage approval and to contractors for costing purposes.
Where the outline design stage is omitted, the design steps described in Section 7.7 should be
incorporated as part of the detailed design stage.
The design should be refined and finalised following the process set out in Figure 7.13.
Figure 7.1 The detailed design process
Chapter 7: The SuDS design process
12
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
7.7.1 Test hydraulic performance of scheme
The scheme should be tested hydraulically to identify the worst case hydraulic condition for each
component for all design return periods. This should be undertaken using either design storms or time
series rainfall (TSR) analysis.
The hydraulic performance of the system should then be optimised to make sure that all storage and
conveyance areas are used as effectively as possible during design rainfall events. Drainage simulation
models can be used where appropriate.
Consideration should be given to the extent to which the SuDS components should function during flood
events affecting the receiving surface waters.
Account should also be taken of any overland flow routes across the site from external areas or other
external flood sources. Such flows will either need to be routed around the site or conveyed across
the site, either in exceedance routes or within the SuDS components themselves. The likely rates and
volumes of these extra flows will need to be accounted for in the system design so that people and
property on the site are not put at risk.
Exceedance routes should be evaluated and designed where required, ensuring appropriate levels of
freeboard between extreme flood levels and building floor levels
Guidance on rainfall characteristics is provided in Section 24.2.3
Guidance on Interception, attenuation and Long-Term Storage design, conveyance and
exceedance route siing is presented in Sections 24.8 to 24.12.
Guidance on infiltration design is provided in Chapter 25.
Guidance on the design of RWH systems is provided in Chapter 11.
Guidance on design of inlets, outlets and flow control systems is provided in Chapter 28.
7.7.2 Check scheme meets design criteria and agreed standards
Checks should be made that the final scheme meets all of the design criteria established for the site
(Section 7.6.2). At this stage, it is likely that the main checks will be that the system meets the agreed
standards for quantity and quality, that:
Interception is delivered for all hard areas
peak rates of runoff for low return period events are adequately controlled
peak rates of runoff for high return period events (including appropriate climate change and urban
creep factors) are adequately controlled
volumes of runoff for high return period events are adequately controlled
high return period events (including appropriate climate change and urban creep factors) do not
pose an unacceptable risk to people or property, as a result of the development
the flow velocities and depths for regular events allow effective treatment to be delivered by
components for which treatment performance is assumed.
The performance of the system with respect to the remaining water quantity and water quality criteria,
and the amenity and biodiversity criteria is unlikely to change materially at this stage in the process.
However if, because of non-compliance with the above standards, a decision is made that a component
should change fundamentally (eg a surface component has to become a subsurface component), then a
review of performance to the full suite of criteria will be required.
Indicators are likely to be a useful way of assessing the performance of the scheme to agreed criteria and
where these have been established early in the design process they can potentially form a framework
12 Part C: Applying the approach
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
for the assessment process (eg “the proportion of the scheme that is on or near the surface” is likely to be
a useful indicator of the extent to which the scheme might deliver a number of the water quality, amenity
and biodiversity criteria).
Example indicators for water quantity, water quality, amenity and biodiversity criteria are
presented in Chapters 3–6.
efine SuDS omonent siin and o ontros
Where the agreed standards (described in Section 7.8.2) are not met satisfactorily, the design will need
to be revisited, and amendments made to component siing and/or flow controls. The hydraulic testing will
then need to be undertaken again. This process will usually occur iteratively until a satisfactory solution
has been identified.

Guidance on treatment design is presented in Chapter 26.
Guidance on siing of inlets, outlets and flow control systems is provided in Chapter 28.
7.7.4 Finalise design
The final design should be refined, taking costs and benefits into account, together with any health and
safety risk assessment (required as part of CDM), constructability and maintainability considerations.
Individual SuDS components should be finalised and detailed following the guidance within the technical
component chapters of this manual and/or appropriate manufacturer literature.
Specifications will need to be prepared for all the materials used in the design, and for the construction
and landscaping works, together with full construction method statements and Maintenance Plans.
Community education and engagement strategies for the completed system should be developed. In
some cases these will evolve from community input provided during earlier design stages.
A design statement should be prepared, which includes a description of each of the system criteria and
standards, and the approaches through which these criteria and standards have been met.

sufficient to support a full planning application, including
infiltration and geotechnical test results and evaluation

8.1 INTRODUCTION
SuDS can be delivered on all sites, but most sites will pose challenges of one sort or
another in relation to the selection and integration of effective SuDS components. Most
of these will be relatively straightforward to solve, using engineering and landscape
best practice. However, there are a few challenges that have mistakenly been raised as
potential reasons why SuDS cannot be used and these are addressed here.
This chapter demonstrates, with examples, how SuDS can be integrated into sites
that have:
contaminated soils or groundwater below the site
high groundwater levels
steep slopes
no gradient or very shallow slopes
underlying rocks or soils that are prone to instability, that is, slope stability,
dissolution or other voids (eg old mine workings)
sites with very deep backfill (eg infilled open cast sites, old landfill sites)
sites with open space in floodplain ones.
8.2 CONTAMINATED SOILS OR GROUNDWATER BELOW THE SITE
8.2.1 The challenges
When designing a surface water management system for a site that overlies contaminated
soil or groundwater, the following issues should be considered within the design process:
1 The presence of contamination in the ground may prevent the use of infiltration.
This is because water soaking through the ground can mobilise contamination and
thereby pollute groundwater.
2 Contaminated groundwater may flow into the SuDS. This would only occur if
unlined conveyance and/or attenuation components are located below maximum
likely groundwater levels.
Chapter Designing for specific site conditions
129
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
3 Contamination may have an adverse effect on materials used in the construction of the SuDS.
4 Inappropriate design of the SuDS could compromise the remediation system provided to protect
residents from any contamination that is left in the ground. One example is where SuDS are
designed to extend below any capping layer provided to prevent contact with contamination.
5 Excavation and disposal of contaminated soils in order to construct drainage systems is expensive.
The above issues are not valid reasons for not using SuDS on sites affected by contamination. They can
be overcome by careful planning, communication, risk assessment and design detailing. It is generally
appropriate to seek advice from a geo-environmental professional with experience in contaminated land
issues, as early as possible in the development planning process, so that drainage and any remediation
strategies can be integrated, and a cost-effective solution developed.
Guidance on planting in contaminated soils is provided in Chapter 29.
reentin the o of ontaminated roundater into the SuDS
Impermeable barriers can be used to prevent contaminated groundwater flowing into any SuDS component.
However, it is preferable to construct the SuDS component above the groundwater table to minimise the risk
of groundwater entering it, rather than relying on liners. The minimum distance between the maximum likely
groundwater table and the base of the SuDS should be based on a detailed groundwater risk assessment,
although 1 m of unsaturated soil is often sufficient, unless specific risks exist.
reentin damae to SuDS materia from ontamination
The issues for the construction of SuDS are no different from any other construction in contaminated
ground, including piped drainage. An assessment of the impact on any materials likely to be in contact
with contamination should be undertaken to make sure that the materials will be durable in the anticipated
exposure conditions. Guidance is provided in Privett et al (1996), EA (2001) and Paul (199).
rotetin the ontaminated and remediation sstem
When designing SuDS on contaminated sites, it is important to fully consider the planned site remediation
strategy. If possible, the SuDS design and the design of the remediation strategy should be integrated, to
maximise efficiencies and opportunities and to minimise costs. Clear communication between all parties
is paramount for the success of these schemes.
If a capping layer is to be provided, it will often only be constructed below gardens and landscaped
areas. Hard areas such as parking are usually considered to be an effective capping layer themselves,
without any extra provision (although this is not the case for pervious pavements). Capping layers can be
extended below SuDS components, such as ponds or swales as shown in Figure 8.1.
If contamination is to be removed or reduced either by excavation or in situ remediation, this may
mean that SuDS can be designed as for any uncontaminated site. Again close collaboration with the
remediation designers is necessary.
inimisin the eaation and disosa of ontaminated sois
The use of well-designed, shallow SuDS can minimise excavation and disposal when compared to piped
drainage and deep tanks. They can also reduce the risk of creating preferential pathways for vapour
and gas migration via pipes and backfill. SuDS that are shallow and on the surface usually also offer
significant advantages with respect to the health and safety of construction workers, because contact
with contaminated soils can be minimised.

Figure 8.1 Contaminated land and SuDS: typical capping layers
he use of infitration on ontaminated and sites
When considering the suitability of infiltration for a contaminated land site, the specific location and
depth of contamination should be evaluated. This will clarify whether infiltration can potentially be
used in some areas and not others,
or if infiltration is not suitable for the
site at all. A risk assessment and
assessment of the leaching potential
of contamination should be undertaken
by a contaminated land specialist, to
determine whether pollution will be
mobilised. If infiltration is not suitable,
then SuDS components should be
designed not to allow infiltration.
The permeable pavement for the high-
density development in Figure 8.2 is
constructed on a small, constrained
brownfield (previously developed) site
where there was some hydrocarbon
contamination from previous industrial
use. The risk assessment together with
the assessment of leaching potential
determined that limited infiltration (to
provide Interception) would not be a risk to groundwater.
Figure 8.2 Unlined permeable pavement on a contaminated site,
Stamford, Lincolnshire (courtesy EPG Limited)
Depending on the depth, infiltration systems can potentially be located below any contamination so that
the infiltrating water does not come into contact with the contamination. Contaminated soils can also be
removed from the immediate area around soakaways. These solutions are illustrated in Figure 8.3. The
use of vertical geomembranes placed around the edge of the excavation could also be considered to
minimise the risk of horiontal migration of the infiltrating water into the contaminated soil.
Chapter Designing for specific site conditions

Figure . Locating infiltration systems beneath layers of contamination and/or removal of contaminated soils from
around soakaways
If infiltration is not considered appropriate for the site, following a risk assessment, drainage systems can
be lined to prevent water soaking into the ground and connected to a suitable outfall system. While not
providing infiltration, and reducing the potential for Interception, it can still attenuate flows. An example of
a lined permeable pavement constructed over a former landfill site is shown in Figure 8.4.
It is important to consider the impact of contamination on the liner, for both geosynthetic and mineral (eg
clay) liners.
If large expanses of a site are covered
by liners (eg a large expanse of lined
permeable pavement in a park-and-ride),
then the impact of effectively sealing the site
surface may need to be considered where
there is gas or vapour contamination in the
ground. If ground gas or vapour is migrating
through the surface of the undeveloped
site, sealing the surface could potentially
force gas to migrate sideways, although this
can be prevented by providing a suitable
venting system. Small areas of impermeable
lining (ie covering a small proportion of the
surface) are not likely to have a great effect
on gas and vapour migration horiontally.

former landfill site, Portsmouth (courtesy EPG Limited)
HIGH GROUNDWATER LEVELS BELOW THE SITE
8.3.1 The challenges
When designing a surface water management system for a site that overlies high groundwater levels (ie
maximum likely groundwater levels are within 1 m of the base of the SuDS component – see Section 25.2.2),
the following challenges should be considered within the design process:
The use of infiltration may not be suitable due to reduced hydraulic and treatment capacity.
If SuDS are constructed below the maximum likely groundwater level, then groundwater can
potentially enter the SuDS component and reduce the storage capacity.
Part C: Applying the approach
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Flotation and structural design risks to
storage structures or impermeable liners
can occur because of the extra loads
imposed by the groundwater and the
buoyancy of the tanks or liner.
One example of SuDS on a site with high
groundwater levels is the Henry Box site in
Witney, Oxfordshire. On this site, shallow
source control methods using a combination of
swales and kerb drains was used to manage
surface water (Figure 8.5). Groundwater was
00 mm to 700 mm below the surface of the
site, and ground levels could not be raised as
part of the development.
he use of infitration here roundater ees are hih
Figure 8.5 Shallow swale on a site with shallow groundwater,
Witney, Oxfordshire (courtesy EPG Limited)
Infiltration may not be suitable where there is not an adequate depth of unsaturated soils (ie greater than
1 m) between the infiltration surface and the groundwater. Any assumption of pollution protection within
the unsaturated soil layer will also be invalidated. Contaminated surface water runoff can potentially
directly pollute groundwater if the groundwater is hydraulically linked to water within the SuDS.
Depending on the depth of groundwater below the site it may be possible to use shallow infiltration basins
or permeable pavements. On some sites careful use of land raising with suitable fill materials may also
be an option, although this will require advice from a ground engineering specialist, to ensure that the
infiltration capacity and risk of settlement or instability is acceptable.
Where infiltration into sites with shallow groundwater tables is proposed, the impact of recharge in thin
aquifers leading to groundwater mounding (even under average conditions) should be considered. This
risk is minimised by using planar infiltration systems such as discharges from below a pervious surface.
The impact of fluvial flood events on groundwater levels should also be considered, as there may be
impacts even if the site is outside the fluvial flood plain.

It is important to keep storage and conveyance systems above maximum likely groundwater levels,
wherever possible. This will avoid difficulties during construction caused by water flows into excavations
and will ensure that the hydraulic and treatment capacity of the SuDS component is retained at all times.
It is very difficult to completely seal a geomembrane around a geocellular tank or permeable pavement,
and any water ingress can impact on the available internal hydraulic storage capacity. This is recognised
in the landfill industry where lining systems rely on multiple layers to form an effective containment
system. Even in landfill sites with highly regulated installation and quality assurance procedures it is
still recognised that holes in a liner can occur, mainly due to defects in jointing or from post-installation
damage (Privett et al, 1996). Table 8.1 provides information in the leakage rates from various defects in
liners. This shows how important it is that robust membranes are used to line tanks, and that they are
integrity tested after installation.

Information on integrity testing of geomembranes used in gas protection systems in buildings is provided
in Mallett et al (201). The methods of integrity testing and advice on visual inspections is applicable to
membranes used in SuDS, and indeed some of the methods described in the report have been used
to test membranes installed around geocellular tanks. Testing may be required at different times of
installation (eg when the membrane is laid out over the base, and then later when the geocellular units
are installed and the membrane is wrapped over the sides and top).
Comparison of leakage rates with the allowed discharge from a tank show that if the leakage rate is
more than about 5% of the allowed discharge rate then the hydraulic design capability of the tank will be
compromised. The use of tanks with membranes below groundwater is not recommended. It should also
be noted that surface linear channel systems cannot be assumed to be completely sealed and, if they
extend below the groundwater table, then water will leak into them.
otation and strutura riss from hih roundater ees
It is important to avoid locating storage tanks or lined sub-base systems below the maximum likely
groundwater level, if at all possible. There are two reasons for this:
The lateral loads on the side of tanks increase significantly if groundwater is applying pressure to the
side of the tank and will therefore impact on the structural design of the system.
Buoyancy of the tank or lined sub-base can cause uplift failure of the system. Flotation should be
prevented by having sufficient counter force, which will be derived from the self-weight of the tank
construction and the weight of permanent backfill over the top of the tank. Shallow 150 mm deep
attenuation tanks have been successfully used below concrete slabs where groundwater was very
close to the surface. In some cases where it has not been possible to resist uplift forces by dead
weight alone, extra resistance has been provided using anchorage systems.
8.4 SLOPING SITES
8.4.1 The challenges
When designing a surface water management system for a steeply sloping site (usually greater than 3%
to 5%), the following issues should be considered within the design process:
the effective utilisation of storage capacity within SuDS components
the likely velocities in swales and basins due to the steep gradients (which affects scour, erosion and
resuspension of pollutants, as well as health and safety)
the risks of infiltrating water reappearing as spring lines further down a slope

draui aait of SuDS omonents on soin sites and ontro of oneane eoities
Available storage capacity can be reduced where SuDS components are implemented on sloping
sites. However, there is usually a need to terrace the site to fit in the proposed development. Roads will
normally be designed to run at shallow slopes across contours. This allows space to be found between
the contours into which SuDS can fit.
A sloping site (as shown in Figures 8.6 and 8.7) can have opportunities for attenuation storage areas.
Terracing for parking areas provides opportunities for pervious pavements to store water. Basins can also
be provided on terraces formed to deliver open space for the development. If space is limited, geocellular
sub-base replacement can be used below such basins to drain larger areas by increasing the available
storage. Successful SuDS design on sloping sites usually involves splitting the runoff catchment into
small, manageable sub-catchments, and looking for all the potential opportunities for runoff conveyance
and storage.

CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
It is possible to slow down the flow of water and increase storage on sloping sites by using check dams in
swales or in storage layers, for example below permeable pavements. Examples of check dams in swales
are shown in Figures 8.8a to 8.8b. Check dams can also be combined with road or pedestrian crossings
as shown in Figure 8.8c. Guidance on check dams in swales and pervious pavements is provided in
Chapters 17 and 20 respectively.

iss from infitration
Whether or not infiltration systems pose a problem on steeply sloping sites will depend on the geology
below the site. The impact of using infiltration drainage on sloping sites should be assessed by a
competent geotechnical engineer or engineering geologist.
It is possible that infiltrating water may cause seepages out of the slope at a lower level, which could
cause flooding or instability. Care also has to be taken where water is infiltrating close to retaining walls,
because water could issue from the face of the wall, or it could increase the overturning pressure on it
and cause it to fail.
A single small soakaway may not have any significant effect on groundwater flows at lower levels, but the
combined effect of many such components could be significant. The geology and slope angle together
with the likely volume of water that is infiltrated will determine the extent of any potential risk. Layered
strata with impermeable soils or rocks will present the greatest risk of spring lines developing due to
infiltration drainage higher up a slope, as shown in Figure 8.9.

136 Part C: Applying the approach
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
8.5 VERY FLAT SITES
8.5.1 The challenges
When designing a surface water management system for a very flat site, the following challenges should
be considered within the design process:
achieving sufficient gradients to drain runoff effectively
difficulty in meeting outlet levels to existing watercourses or sewers
impacts of downstream water levels on drainage system performance.
Suffiien of hdraui radients for effetie drainae
On very flat sites, it is often not possible to construct piped drainage systems with sufficient falls to
achieve minimum self-cleansing velocities. So using shallow SuDS components such as swales, pervious
pavements or high capacity linear drainage channels is an advantage in these situations. Good SuDS
design should aim to divide the site into small sub-catchments and provide local combined storage and
conveyance components. The hydraulic head that develops as water flows into and builds up in the
system will then cause water to flow out of the system.
This is a common issue in low-lying coastal (internal drainage board) areas where piped drainage and
the necessary cover often compromise the ability to achieve a suitable outfall. A common solution is to
provide extensions of rhyne systems and provide storage volume within an on-site swale/rhyne system
embedded throughout the development.
On flat sites, or indeed any site where a storage tank or layer has a flat base, ponding of water may occur
in the base of the storage. If this occurs in systems that are not lined (where the soils are impermeable
and do not therefore allow infiltration), the water could be in contact with the underlying soils for a
significant length of time and could ultimately reduce the strength of the soil. If possible, a slight fall on
any subgrade exposed to water is preferred, to avoid ponding of water. If this cannot be provided, then the
reduction in strength due to waterlogging should be taken into account in the structural design of tanks or
pervious pavements.
eetin minimum outet ees
A normal drainage system will often end up being fairly deep. Even using shallow SuDS components,
the end of the surface water drainage system may still end up below the minimum allowable outfall level.
In such cases, a pumping station will be necessary. Several SuDS schemes have included pumping
stations, but they should be a last resort and only allowable in situations where guaranteed maintenance
of the pumps can be ensured.
Figure 8.10 demonstrates the advantages of SuDS in meeting minimum outfall level constraints.

8.6 SITES WITH POTENTIALLY UNSTABLE SUBSURFACE ROCKS OR SOIL WORKINGS
8.6.1 The challenges
When designing a surface water management system on a site that may be prone to subsurface soil or
rock instability, the following issues should be considered within the design process:
Water infiltration into the ground can cause instability in poorly consolidated soils, because the water
can wash out the soil or cause it to compact. Also, rocks such as chalk may slowly dissolve over time.
Water from infiltration systems can cause slope or retaining wall failure, because water pressure may
increase in the soil behind the slope or wall.
Guidance on areas of potential surface geology instability can be found via BGS infiltration maps
http://tinyurl.com/oruu25r
nstabe soi or ro matri
SuDS for sites where there are soils or rocks prone to instability should not use infiltration as a runoff
destination, and it may be necessary to line systems to prevent any water infiltrating the ground. This will
depend on the risks associated with any potential instability and the likely volume of water discharging to
the infiltration device when compared to natural exposure to rainfall on the same area. A small amount of
infiltration to provide Interception may not be a problem.
Using infiltration drainage in chalk can cause settlement due to solution of the chalk or infilled features in
the surface of the chalk. Guidance is provided in Lord et al (2002).
The use of SuDS in such areas with rock/soil instability risks will require advice from a geotechnical
specialist. Areas that need specific care include the areas around old shafts or adits into mine workings,
shallow mine workings, limestone and areas with buried, infilled solution features. Shafts and adits and
infilled solution features have often been filled with loosely compacted soil that has very marginal stability.
The passage of water through it can cause loss of material, as fines are washed out, leading to collapse
of the soil mass.
iss to soes andor retainin as
If water is allowed to infiltrate behind slopes or retaining walls, it can increase pore pressures in
the ground. This may increase the pressure on the wall or slope and cause it to fail. Infiltration
devices should be located at a sufficient distance from slopes and retaining walls to prevent any
adverse effects on stability. The appropriate distance should be based on a slope/wall stability and
groundwater flow assessment.
8.7 SITES WITH VERY DEEP BACKFILL
he issues
When designing a surface water management system on a site located above or close to infilled open
cast sites or old landfill sites, the following issues should be considered within the design process
Infiltrating water can cause compaction of the existing fill material.
Any settlement of the backfill is likely to cause surface level changes, which can potentially affect
gradients along a drainage system or cause damage to liners. Settlement can cause tension cracks
that allow more water to infiltrate, which may not be acceptable. This issue may affect the viability
of an entire development. So if the site is suitable for development over the backfill then it will most
likely be suitable for some form of SuDS.

8.8 SUDS ON FLOODPLAINS
he issues
10 Part C: Applying the approach
The main concern is the potential effect of infiltration on settlement of deeper areas of fill. Infiltration
should be avoided unless it can be demonstrated that the fill material is sufficiently well compacted that
settlement will not be a problem (as well as being sufficiently permeable).
As shown previously in Figure 8.4, a drainage scheme has used permeable paving over a landfill site in
Portsmouth. The system is lined to prevent infiltration.
SuDS such as swales and permeable pavements are likely to be more tolerant of movements due to
settlement than piped drainage. Where there are potential risks, however, the effect on gradients should
be assessed and any liners should be carefully detailed to prevent tearing. Pipe drainage can only
tolerate a small amount of movement at the joints.
On some sites, floodplains might be the only available public open space. The role of a floodplain is
primarily to mitigate flood risk from rivers or tides, and during extreme events these areas will naturally
flood with river or seawater, making them ineffective for use in storing surface water runoff. It is highly
unlikely that any storage volume achieved within a floodplain would be allowed to meet a development’s
total surface water attenuation requirement. All storage volume should normally be provided within the
development footprint, outside of the floodplain.
The presence of a floodplain, however, should not preclude the site from including SuDS, as they could
still be effective in managing routine rainfall, and runoff may need to be discharged safely across the
floodplain. SuDS in the floodplain may also be acceptable in terms of providing treatment for frequent
events. The design of those parts of SuDS in a floodplain should not reduce floodplain storage or
conveyance.
8.8.2 Design considerations
Any SuDS within a floodplain should be selected and designed taking account of the likely high
groundwater table and vulnerability to erosion during periods of high flows/water levels.
Design of any conveyance routes should limit grading and the creation of surface features (such as
berms and unreinforced channels) that could either reduce floodplain capacity or be washed out in a
flood. Surface discharge from SuDS should be dispersed (ie allowed to shed off as sheet flow) with point
discharges minimised or eliminated.
All SuDS within or crossing a floodplain should take full consideration of the likely influence of river water
levels on the design performance (in terms of level, frequency, duration and impact on SuDS conveyance
and storage). Combined probability assessments may be required.
Siltation and subsequent clearance after a flood event has subsided should also be taken into account in
the design.
The SuDS shown in the development in Stamford in Figure 8.2 are located in the flood plain.

9.1 INTRODUCTION
The drainage of roads using SuDS is a design application scenario that has specific
challenges owing to the need to protect the road pavement from damage and ensure that
extra safety risks are not introduced by the design of the drainage system.
Road/highway design requirements will also be a key influence, and there needs to
be co-operation between road/highway and SuDS designers to achieve the most
effective schemes.
This chapter is not intended to be a complete guide to designing SuDS for roads. It
covers the following specific concerns and issues that are often raised
1 general road drainage approval issues
2 interface with buried utility services
examples of SuDS components used for road drainage
use of infiltration systems for road drainage
5 filter drain design issues
6 swale design issues
7 exceedance flow management

9 safety issues
10 retrofitting SuDS for road drainage as part of a highways improvement scheme (but
not standalone retrofit of SuDS)
11 maintenance issues.
There is other guidance on designing SuDS specifically for roads (including highways),
and this is referenced at the end of the chapter (Section 9.14).
9.2 APPROVAL AND ADOPTION OF SUDS IN OR ADJACENT TO ROADS
Roads, over which there is a public right of passage, have to be constructed to an
agreed standard, with prior technical approval for the design having been secured by
Chapter 9: Designing for roads and highways
143
9.3 9.4 9.5 144 CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
the developer from the relevant highways authority. Any road design must also include details of how the
road surface is to be drained and what drainage components are to be employed.
Currently, surface water drainage components that drain only an adopted road have to be approved by
the local highway authority. Their design may also require approval by the drainage approving body,
which could differ from the highway authority. (Although it would normally be in the same local authority,
it could be different departments.) If SuDS components drain both the road and adjacent parts of the
development, it is more likely that the drainage system will be approved and adopted by the drainage
approving body. In the case of pervious surfaces acting as the road surface, this element of the system
is likely to be adopted by the highway authority, whether or not they adopt the underlying drainage layer.
This is a complex area, and guidance on relevant approval and adoption protocols should be sought from
local stakeholders before SuDS design.
Discussions should be held early in the design process to ensure that SuDS for roads are designed to the
standards required by the relevant adopting body. It is advisable to consider drainage from roads specifically
during the master planning process, taking account of local road (including street) design guidelines and
engaging the local highways authority representative, so that a cost-efficient solution can be determined
that benefits private property owners, drainage authorities and the highways authority (Chapter 7).
INTERFACE WITH BURIED UTILITY SERVICES
The layout of buried utility services needs to be considered as part of the SuDS design. As far as possible
the services should be located in corridors, and the choice of SuDS should recognise their presence.
For example, using pervious surfaces over services may not be appropriate in a road where uncontrolled
excavation by utility companies could damage the system and lead to flooding. Conversely there are
many large commercial sites where concrete block permeable paving has been constructed over buried
services without any issues.
Another constraint posed by buried services is where surface features have to be connected below
a road. The presence of utilities below the road will lead to the surface water system below the road
(usually a pipe) being at least 1 m deep so that they are below the normal services and so the risk of
damage by excavation is minimised.
CONNECTIONS BETWEEN FEATURES BELOW ROADS
Connections between surface features will often have to pass below roads. Normally the most effective
way to provide the connection is to use a pipe (or pipes). The pipes are usually required to be placed as
shallow as feasible to minimise the depth of the surface features (as this can potentially impact on the
design, cost and benefits associated with the drainage system). However, in addition to the constraints
imposed by services described above, the cover depth to protect a pipe from traffic loadings is normally
1.2 m, although they can be placed at shallower depth if the strength is increased or they are surrounded
in concrete.
If consideration is being given to placing pipes at shallower depth than usual, the risk of damage by utility
companies should be assessed.
There are also concerns about shallow concrete surrounds causing hard spots in the pavement
construction. If the pavement is not heavily trafficked and has been constructed correctly (especially
compaction of materials) this is not likely to damage the pavement surface or affect its performance.
APPLICATION OF SUDS FOR ROAD DRAINAGE
There are several SuDS components that are particularly suitable for draining roads.
Part C: Applying the approach
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Pervious pavements (Chapter 20) are often used for low trafficked roads, particularly in residential
areas. These can include permeable paving, porous asphalt, pervious concrete or reinforced grass
systems (Figures 9.1 to 9.3).

a residential road, Cambridge (courtesy Cambridge City
Council)

tramlines, Switerland (courtesy EPG Limited)
Figure 9. Swale and wetland systems with reinforcedaccess points, A16, Lincolnshire (courtesy EPG Limited)
 grass used in less trafficked areas such as laybys and field
Swales (Chapter 17) are an extremely useful method for draining long stretches of road where the road
is close to existing ground level and there are few buried services alongside or crossing the road. Swales
are usually not suitable where roads are located on embankments unless they are lined (because any
infiltrating water could cause stability issues) or where the available space is limited. Other longitudinal
drainage components include filter stris (Chapter 15), which can be used for initial treatment, and filter
drains (Chapter 16), which take less space, but tend to provide less storage capacity than swales and
can clog more easily. The provision of an underdrain to the swale can allow for crossing points without
disrupting conveyance flows.

The profiled edge paving shown in Figure 9.4 traps silt and limits vehicle overrun. The check dams
reduce conveyance velocities.
Figure 9.5 shows the swale and wetland system used for the A16 in Lincolnshire. In some places surface
water runs directly from the road surface into the swale in others edge channels collect and discharge
to the swale (eg from areas of road on low embankments where water flowing down the slopes could
cause instability) and in others (where kerbs are required) the kerb drainage collects surface water and
discharges to the swale.
Detention basins, ponds and wetlands (Chapters 22 and 23) may be suitable for roundabouts or
junctions, and are also used extensively on the motorway and trunk road network, where there is space
in open countryside.

The detention basin shown in Figure 9.7, draining a rural road in Oxfordshire, has simple dropped
kerb inlets into a filter strip one trap silt. Low mown grass around the edges ensures that site lines are
maintained. Other areas drain into the basin via pipes.
Bioretention systems (Chapter 18) can be fitted within road build-outs as traffic calming features and within
dead space in car parks or turning areas, providing amenity and biodiversity benefits within urban areas.
Proprietary silt traps, proprietary treatment systems, oil interceptors, gully and pipe systems
(Chapter 14) may form part of a cost-effective road drainage solution where space is particularly limited
or other site constraints are present. Early engagement with the adopting body and those that would have
responsibility for maintenance is necessary to ensure their acceptability and viability.
For example, hydrodynamic vortex separators have been used to treat pollution from road runoff on a
scheme to widen the M25 (Figure 9.10). An oil separator is preceded by a large sediment trap and leads
to a sedimentation channel and attenuation basin.

Attenuation storage (Chapter 21) may be appropriate in space constrained areas. It may be combined
with solutions such as swales or bioretention. There are many examples where road drainage attenuation
tanks have been adopted by highways authorities or have been used on motorways, especially as part of
widening schemes.

ALLOWING WATER TO INFILTRATE IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE ROAD PAVEMENT
Normal road pavement materials are affected by the presence of water, which gradually weakens them
and leads to defects such as potholes. SuDS that are adjacent to normal pavement construction should
therefore be designed to prevent water infiltration into the pavement or into the soils below it, as they may
lose strength if excess water is present. If surface water depths in the adjacent drainage components are
kept low, then the infiltrating water will flow downwards and not sideways, and simple details such as that
shown in Figure 9.12 can prevent water from flowing into the adjacent pavement structure.
Retrofitting SuDS as part of highway improvement works may well encounter older types of road
construction, and the design needs to recognise and be sympathetic to this. The system in Figure 9.12
would be provided with an overflow to the underdrain, and this can allow access for cleaning if necessary.
Swales located next to roads should not, in normal circumstances, be very deep for safety reasons.
If there are outstanding concerns regarding risks associated with infiltrating water, swales can be
underdrained, which will act as a subsurface drain at the side of the road (Figure 9.13 and HA /06
see Section 9.14). For very shallow swales and low-speed roads a side slope of may be acceptable
both from a safety and maintenance perspective (this will depend on the planting design and maintenance
regime). For faster roads and deeper swales 25 side slopes may be more appropriate to address safety
concerns and make simple grass mowing easier.

FILTER DRAINS FOR ROAD DRAINAGE
Highways England (formerly the Highways Agency) has used filter drains as combined surface and
subsurface drains for many years (HD /06 see Section 9.14) but there are a few performance issues
that need to be considered
There is a risk of stone scatter from the surface of filter drains.
Slopes on the sides of embankments can fail due to water ingress.
Water can cause pavement failures (filter drains often have larger depths of water than swales and
tend to be located closer to the pavement structure, therefore the risk of ingress is greater).
If not maintained, the risk of clogging and blockage can increase the risk of surface water flooding
and also water ingress to the road pavement construction. The risk of clogging can be greatly
reduced by allowing water to run over a 1 m width of grass filter strip before the filter drain, if this is
possible within the constraints of road/highway design.
Part C: Applying the approach
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
The greater the distance from the filter drain to the main carriageway, the less the problem caused by stone
scatter and the less the effects of water on the pavement. If necessary, the filter drain could be lined with an
impermeable membrane to prevent water ingress to the adjacent road pavement construction.
HD /06 (Section 9.14) provides information of relevance to the design of filter drains for roads/
highways. A general filter drain detail for roads is shown in Figure 9.14. The boundary between the
impervious area and the vegetation is key to ensure success with this design. This can be an area of
significant erosion, compaction, sediment build-up and contamination that has to be considered in the
design and maintenance requirements. The significance of these issues increase as the traffic frequency
and area drained to the edge increases. On heavily trafficked roads this edge may need frequent
maintenance to remove silt.
Figure 9.1 Filter drain details for cuttings combined surface water and groundwater drainage
9.8 SWALES FOR ROAD DRAINAGE
Highways England has used grassed channels as surface drains for highways for many years (HD /06
see Section 9.14) but the following needs to be considered
The profile and location of the channel should not pose a haard to traffic.
The swale should be designed to allow easy access for maintenance.
The swale should be designed so that water ingress into the ground will not affect the adjacent
pavement construction. If necessary the swale can be lined with an impermeable geomembrane.
HD /06 (Section 9.14) provides information of relevance to the design of swales for strategic trunk
roads/highways and motorways. Although not completely applicable to other roads, it does contain useful
information that can be used and adapted by designers of swales alongside other roads. A general swale
detail for roads is shown in Figure 9.15.
Kerb drains can be an effective way of collecting water from road surfaces and discharging it at shallow
depths into swales. (The rear outlets from the kerb drain to the swale should be at very regular spacing
to keep flow rates low and minimise the risk of erosion.) In Figure 9.16 the roof water from the houses
discharges into the kerb drains that are draining the road. The kerb drain discharges to the channel drain
across the road which in turn discharges to the swale at the right of the picture. This keeps the swale very
shallow. The system has been adopted by the local highways authority (Oxfordshire County Council).
Another kerb drain outlet directly into a swale is shown in Figure 9.17.

ROADS FOR EXCEEDANCE FLOW MANAGEMENT
Roads can provide routes for flows that exceed the capacity of the drainage system (Figure 9.19). Further
guidance is provided in Balmforth et al (2006) and Digman et al (201).
Roads can be designed or modified to maximise their exceedance flow conveyance or storage capacity,
but great care is needed to ensure that the flows do not cause problems further downstream and do not
represent a haard to vehicles and pedestrians.
Road designs can be modified to act as efficient exceedance routes by various methods including
raising kerb heights (within acceptable limits of road design)
removing drop kerbs (if practical)
reprofiling ground levels behind drop kerbs
introducing dropped kerbs or reprofiling to allow water to run from the road carriageway into suitable
open areas of land adjacent to the road
raising sections of carriageway to provide a dam that allows further storage and attenuation of
exceedance flows. This can often be integrated with, or be part of, traffic management schemes (eg
speed humps).
Where the road is drained using conventional pipework, the number and capacity of road gullies will
determine the division of flows between the subsurface system and the road. These should be optimised
so that flood risks are managed most effectively.
9.10 TREATING ROAD RUNOFF
For the design of roads in development sites the general guidance on water quality principles and criteria
provided in Chapter 4 should be followed. For trunk roads and motorways that are the responsibility of
Chapter 9: Designing for roads and highways
151
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Highways England, there are specific guidance documents and risk assessment approaches provided
in HD 5/09 (Section 9.14). HD /06 (Section 9.14) also includes indicative treatment efficiencies for
drainage systems and guidance on appropriate combinations of vegetative and proprietary systems.
Gully emptying, road sweeping and other road maintenance tasks are important pollution prevention
strategies for road runoff, and the treatment of the runoff at or close to its source should be a priority
(Chapter 27).
Winter maintenance activities and particularly the gritting of roads can have adverse impacts on the health
of vegetation next to roads. Planting should be specified that is as tolerant as possible of potential higher
chloride levels in winter runoff. The winter performance of pervious surfaces is discussed in Chapter 20.
In order to maintain the filtration capacity of vegetation systems at the edge of roads it is necessary to
protect them from rutting caused by vehicle overrun.
9.11 DESIGNING SAFE SUDS ADJACENT TO ROADS
Any drainage system needs to be safe and there are specific safety considerations for components that
lie adjacent to roads. The risk of a vehicle overturning and the ease of maintenance are the main issues
to consider when decided on an appropriate slope to the side of the swale. For swales next to high-speed
roads, Highways England specifies a maximum slope to the swale of 1 in 5 and a maximum water depth
of 200 mm (HA 119/06 see Section 9.14). For slow-speed access roads in residential areas a side
slope of 1 in is more appropriate if the swale is very shallow. Discouraging vehicle overrun with profiled
paving (as shown in Figure 9.4) is also useful in this respect.
Vegetation in SuDS should not interfere with sight lines. In Figure 9.7 the grass around the edge of the
detention basin is cut regularly to maintain site lines. The vegetation in the centre of the detention basin
can be left to grow higher.
9.12 RETROFITTING SUDS FOR ROADS
The most likely occasions where retrofitting into an existing road drainage system could be considered to
be practical and cost effective are
during road reconstruction/resurfacing schemes
during large-scale drainage improvement schemes
increased residential expansion in urban and rural schemes.
Further information on retrofitting SuDS is provided in Digman et al (2012). The overriding factor in
choosing suitable locations for retrofitting SuDS will be the existing falls on the carriageway and the
location and depth of buried services. Before any design work on a retrofit SuDS is undertaken, a
comprehensive utilities and topographical survey should be completed so that the SuDS can be designed
around the buried services and existing levels.
In dense urban environments, roads constructed before the 1950s could include crushed rock or hoggin
sub-base (hoggin is an as-dug mixture of clayey sand and gravel common in the south-east of England),
clinker construction, granite sett construction or wooden tar block construction. Designing around these
types of construction is site-specific. Care needs to be taken that the SuDS will not adversely affect
the construction by allowing water into it and the impact of breaking into the construction does not
compromise the long-term stability of the pavement. Breaking into concrete pavements to construct SuDS
also needs to be done with care to ensure that the stability of the pavement is not adversely affected.
When retrofitting SuDS to existing roads, the gradients and kerb levels will be an important influence on
drainage paths. Designers should always check existing gradients and finished kerb height levels and
152 Part C: Applying the approach
9.13 9.14 CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
assess any likely future changes that may occur as a result of maintenance works to ensure that the
SuDS will drain the road effectively in the long term.
When retrofitting SuDS in rural roads, how the road is constructed, drained and maintained will influence
the design. A large proportion of rural roads have been maintained by having had many applications of
surface dressing (chip and tar), so levels and falls will simply follow the original profile (which will have
been a cart track). If the road is reconstructed to modern standards the cross falls and longitudinal
gradients may change and water may not flow to the SuDS.
It is impossible to provide a completely water-tight road construction, and there is always a level of
moisture within any road construction, especially in the sub-base. It is important that, in addition to
not increasing the moisture levels, the retrofit SuDS does not cut off existing drainage paths within
the sub-base.
Further advice including potential retrofit opportunities for SuDS adjacent to roads is provided by Pittner
and Allerton (2009).
THE MAINTENANCE OF SUDS ADJACENT TO ROADS
The maintenance requirements for SuDS alongside roads are no different from those in other situations,
and reference should be made to Chapter 32, and also to the individual technical component sections of
this manual.
SuDS draining roads should be reinstated and established correctly, if service companies dig trenches
through them. The profile of a swale should be reinstated to the correct levels and use appropriate topsoil
and seeding. The repair will need to be protected from erosion until the vegetation is fully established.
Pervious surfaces and bioretention systems will require the correct permeable materials to be used in
reinstatement.
Wherever SuDS are present over buried services they are an engineering problem in the event of
excavation, and the road should be classified as a street with special engineering difficulties (SED) under
the New Roads and Street Works Act (NRSWA) 1991. Further information on SEDs and the NRSWA is
provided by the Department for Transport (2012).
ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE RELEVANT FOR SUDS DRAINING ROADS
Pittner and Allerton (2009) provides guidance on SuDS design and implementation for road surfaces.

to SuDS

subsurface drains
These documents refer to design for the strategic road network (SRN) and local highway authorities
(LHAs) should refer to published guidance if they wish to adapt this guidance for use on their networks
(UK Roads Liaison Group, 2011). The use of standard designs and specification is useful and can avoid
many pitfalls. However, it should be recognised that effective design often requires standard requirements
and specifications to be adapted to particular circumstances that apply to a site.
It is only trunk roads that are required to be designed according to the DMRB and in the Manual of
Contract Documents for Highway Works (MCHW) Specification for highway works (HA, 2005). For all
other roads, the decisions on the choice of standards and their incorporation into designs remain in the
hands of local highway authorities.
The UK Roads Liaison Group’s document has been written to assist highway authorities assessing
departures from ighways Agencys Standards and designers preparing submissions. The stated aim
is that the departures process should be viewed as an opportunity to simply and effectively record the
best judgements of the professionals involved in the delivery of a road/highway scheme, rather being
overly bureaucratic.
The DMRB is frequently amended to reflect advances in design and construction practice, and therefore
the list above should not be considered exhaustive and designers should check whether updated version
have been published.
esigning streets (The Scottish Government, 2010) provides a policy statement in Scotland for street
design with an emphasis on place-making, including the use of SuDS.
Manual for streets (DfT and DCLG, 2007) provides guidance on design, planning and approval of new
residential streets and modifications to existing ones.
Manual for streets (CIHT, 2010) is a companion guide to the Manual for streets and demonstrates
through guidance and case studies how the philosophies set out in Manual for streets can be extended
beyond residential streets to encompass both urban and rural situations. It is intended to fill the perceived
gap in design advice between the Manual for streets and the DMRB.

10Chapter Designing for the urban
environment
This chapter sets out how to evaluate the opportunities and challenges
associated with implementing SuDS for high density new development
and sites within existing urban areas redevelopment sites infill sites and
retrofit sites Much of the guidance is also relevant for suburban sites
It discusses how to design schemes that deliver effective surface water
management while maximising amenity and biodiversity benefits for
urban communities, by following the SuDS design criteria set out in
hapters
The images and illustrations provide urban planners, architects, landscape
architects and drainage designers with examples of the different options
and opportunities available Example SuS solutions for different types of
urban development are presented as a set of nine typologies
This chapter should be read alongside Chapters 3–9 in order to understand the many
issues that influence the selection of appropriate SuS for the urban environment
10.1 OBJECTIVES FOR SURFACE WATER MANAGEMENT IN THE
URBAN ENVIRONMENT
10.1.1 Surface water management and urban design
Surface water management should be an integral part of urban design
Successful integration of SuDS into urban design requires:
1 early consideration of surface water as part of an integrated design process
2 a collaborative, interdisciplinary design team that brings together developers,
engineers, planners, landscape architects, architects, ecologists and the local
community.
Surface water management should be considered at the very early stages of urban
planning (Chapter 7), to help shape and enhance the overall vision for the area,
whether this is part of, for example, the redevelopment or regeneration of an existing
urban area, infill development, a new large high-density development or part of a green
infrastructure strategy. By adopting this approach, designers can make best use of the
space available, delivering cost-effective multi-functional developments.
See the Rathbone Market case study in Section 10.4.
Flooding and poor water quality are the main drivers for surface water management. The
high proportion of impermeable surfaces, high pollution loads in surface water runoff
and limited sewer capacity have left a legacy of problems for our urban areas. However,
there are other issues facing our urban areas that can be addressed by improving the way
that surface water is managed. For example, natural drainage systems and green space
have often been lost or severely fragmented, leaving a degraded ecological landscape.
The combined effect of large expanses of hard surfacing and less green space means
that cities are warmer than the surrounding areas (the urban heat island effect), which
Chapter 10: Designing for the urban environment
157
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
can result in uncomfortable living conditions and health problems during periods of hot weather. Areas of
planting or open water, and features that retain water can help reduce the temperature of urban surfaces
during hot summer periods. Trees can help shade buildings, reducing internal air temperatures, and green
roofs can improve a building’s thermal insulation properties.
The challenge of managing surface water effectively within the urban environment is intensifying with
climate change, continued urbanisation and urban creep. Climate change projections indicate that more
intense rainfall and higher temperatures will become more frequent in the UK. The density of development
is also increasing and, with this, competition for the use of space is exacerbated. This means that reversing
urban creep and maximising the multi-functionality of urban space is essential (Section 10.2.6).
The challenge for designers and planners is to create integrated urban spaces that include SuDS in
creative and innovative ways, taking into consideration their potential contribution to a range of functions,
such as flood risk management, water supply, green infrastructure, habitat provision, transport corridors,
climate proofing, community identity, recreation and tourism. In this way, SuDS can make a significant
contribution to the delivery of a wide range of local planning policies and objectives.
10.1.2 SuDS and urban place-making
SuDS an mae a sinifiant ontribution to imroin here e ie and or
Good urban design should be about place-making’ all urban design projects should have a strong
focus on the people and community that will inhabit and use the space, providing opportunities for people
to interact with each other and their environment.
People have always been drawn to water in the urban environment, due to the beauty it can create in
the landscape, its calming and cooling effects and its use for recreation. The positive presence of water
within the urban environment can promote a strong sense of place, creating unique spaces that can be
enjoyed by all. Features such as reflective pools, ponds, fountains, water playscapes, planted rills etc, if
designed creatively, can help to bring an urban space to life and connect people, nature and water.
SuDS can make a significant contribution to supporting urban communities. People are more likely to
feel that they belong to the local community and take a greater pride in their neighbourhood where they
have opportunities for human interaction, such as recreational facilities and places to congregate. This
in turn can have a wide range of secondary benefits, such as encouraging businesses to move into the
neighbourhood, investment in amenity facilities and events and visitors to come and spend money. It can
even lead to crime reduction. These benefits are discussed in more detail in Chapter 5.
Effective consideration of urban community needs and opportunities during the design stage can help
maximise benefits (Chapter 34). For example, green spaces have an important role to play in improving
the health and well-being of the urban population, as they can contribute towards the improvement of air
quality, provide shade and urban cooling, as well as help play a part in surface water and wider flood risk
management strategies for the area.
See the Bristol Harbourside case study in Section 10.4.
Connected green infrastructure can facilitate walking and cycling routes within tranquil settings and
recreational green space. These benefits in turn provide opportunities for people to come into contact
with nature, to experience the seasons, to become more active and to live and work in a more attractive
and stimulating environment, all of which are proven to have positive effects on health and well-being.
10.1.3 Finding space for SuDS
Good SuDS design maximises the use of the available space
Sites within urban areas are often confined and restricted. Planning and design constraints are often
tighter than at other sites, and land is often more valuable. Introducing SuDS can appear challenging

when faced with competing development objectives, but SuDS can be integrated into a development
without negatively impacting upon the primary function of the urban space (Case study 10.1).
CASE

10.1
Hunter Avenue, Kent
Figure 10.1 Hunter Avenue (courtesy Kent County Council)
Working within the constraints of 50 dwellings per hectare, the development at Hunter Avenue
incorporates green space effectively, improving the aesthetics and providing opportunities for
recreation, while increasing the number of street trees on the site.
Permeable paving with below-ground attenuation is used to manage surface water runoff.
Exceedance flows are contained within the road curtilage and parking areas along the southern
boundary of the site.
Opportunities for the creation of SuDS can be found in even the smallest spaces, and a perceived lack of
space is not a justifiable reason for not using SuDS.
For example, as part of the conceptual design stage (Chapter 7) the following potential uses of the site
should be considered:
Can green roofs be used as an alternative to standard roof construction?
Can roof runoff be harvested in tanks for non-potable use within buildings, such as toilet flushing
Are there other potential non-potable uses for surface water runoff (eg landscape irrigation,
urban horticulture)?
Can harvested rainwater be used as a resource for water features and recreational play areas?
Can impermeable surfaces (roofs, parking, pavements etc) be replaced by pervious surfaces and/or
include permeable sub-base in which water can be stored
Where impermeable surfaces are necessary, can these be drained to small bioretention systems,
open water amenity features and/or tree pits?
Chapter 10: Designing for the urban environment
159
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Can private or public landscaped areas use or be redesigned to include tree pits, landscaping
planters, rain gardens, bioretention systems or swales to provide storage and treatment of runoff?
Can small areas in front or back gardens or yards be designed as bioretention planters to capture
roof runoff or configured to include rainwater harvesting systems
Can proprietary products be used to help control flows, store water and/or provide treatment in
confined spaces
Traditionally, the perceived usable space for SuDS has been confined to what is deemed to be public
space from fence to fence’ which can limit the potential for SuDS implementation and a fully
integrated approach. Looking at the urban space as being from ‘door to door’ (blurring the boundaries
between public and private land) provides many more opportunities for using space efficiently.
Underutilised land often falls along the interfaces between public and private land, such as grass
verges and other small pockets of vegetation or paving. Reviewing this land and discussing potential
opportunities with landowners and the community can unlock large areas that can be used to enhance
the streetscape as a whole as well as supporting SuDS strategies. Facilitating this approach will require
effective community engagement, but there is an increasing number of cases where this has been
successfully achieved, as discussed in Chapter 34.
Integrating SuDS within urban space can also deliver biodiversity benefits. This may be through
introducing or enhancing the green and blue space for the site, reconnecting fragmented green space in
the surrounding area and/or linking with local green infrastructure.
Examples of where SuDS can enhance green infrastructure include:
street trees as individual specimens, lines of trees that can connect green spaces together and
groves of trees that can form habitat islands (Chapter 19)
management of existing street trees and enhancement by using SuDS to increase air and water
availability for tree roots
maximising the plant coverage by replacing hard barriers with hedges etc
extensive and intensive green roofs
green walls and vertical gardens
using SuDS components such as swales and detention basins within multi-functional landscape features
using reinforced grass surfaces in place of hard surfaces where appropriate
raised planters, which can provide temporary storage measures
diversity of planting and habitat provision.
Urban SuDS should always take a form that responds to the location, character, drivers and opportunities
associated with the site. There are a number of components or component derivations likely to be more
relevant for dense urban areas. The examples given below are not exhaustive, and different components
will develop as SuDS design progresses in the future. All of these types of components are used within
the typologies presented and illustrated in Section 10.3. Guidance on how to design and implement the
SuDS components is provided in Chapters 11–23.

PERVIOUS SURFACES
Figure 10.2 Pervious surfaces (courtesy Interpave)
Pervious surfaces can be used in combination with aggregate sub-base and/or geocellular/modular
storage to attenuate and/or infiltrate runoff from surrounding surfaces and roofscapes. Liners can be
used where ground conditions are not suitable for infiltration. A variety of different surfacing materials are
available (Chapter 20).
KERB DRAINAGE, RILLS AND CHANNELS
Figure 10.3 Kerb drainage, rills and channels (courtesy ACO, Illman Young)
Kerb drainage, rills and channels can keep runoff on the surface and convey runoff along the surface to
downstream SuDS components. They can include inverted road profiles with central surface conveyance
in low traffic areas. Some proprietary kerb and channel drainage systems can trap silt and oil from runoff
and provide treatment (Chapter 14).
PLANTED CHANNELS
Figure 10.4 Planted channels (courtesy Robert Bray Associates, Graham Fairhurst)
Planted channels can provide conveyance routes that treat runoff and attenuate flows. They can be in the
form of ground-level planted channels and raised planters. These can form privacy strips along interfaces
to reaffirm public/private boundaries and support urban greening.

BIORETENTION SYSTEMS AND RAIN GARDENS

Planted areas and raised planters can be used as rain gardens and other types of bioretention systems,
including areas between the road and building elevations, at street intersections or traffic islands, as kerb
extensions to create parking bays or traffic calming measures (Chapter 18).

GREEN ROOFS, GREEN WALLS AND PODIUM DECKING
Figure 10.8 Green roofs (courtesy Sky Garden, Arup)
Green roofs can be used to treat and attenuate runoff in their substrate and support root uptake of
water with appropriate planting, while also insulating buildings and reducing the urban heat island effect
(Chapter 12). Green walls can be used to attenuate roof runoff within their substrate and extensive
planting, receiving natural irrigation and supporting natural ventilation and building temperature
regulation. Podium landscapes can include geocellular storage and attenuation within pavement build-up
on roof terraces and decks.
PUBLIC SPACES

Public spaces can double as shallow detention basins and flood channels, and can also provide
opportunities for ponds and wetlands (Chapters 22 and 23).

PLAY AND EDUCATION

164 Part C: Applying the approach
etrofittin SuDS
etrofittin SuDS maes our urban areas more resiient
Retrofitting SuDS is a vital part of the overall strategy for making towns and cities more resilient to
future climate change and urbanisation, considering new development only comprises around 1% of
land use change within urban areas each year (Adaptation Sub-Committee, 2012). While SuDS for new
developments (and redevelopments) can prevent any increase in flood risk from surface water caused by
the development, retrofit SuDS can reduce the existing risk.
Retrofitting SuDS into urban spaces is possible in many places. Detailed guidance on the opportunities
for SuDS retrofit and the implementation mechanisms are set out in detail in Digman et al (2012).
The extent and type of SuDS components that can be used for a retrofit site will be influenced by the
specific characteristics of the site. The extent to which a retrofit SuDS scheme can deliver the SuDS
design criteria (Section 10.2) will depend on the context of the development, land use and the specific
retrofit drivers, which will be set by the stakeholders involved in funding and planning the retrofit scheme.
Retrofitting SuDS into urban streets as a standalone project may not always appear to be cost-beneficial.
It is often easier and more cost-effective if it is done as part of other works to improve an area, such as
constructing traffic calming measures or highway maintenance improvements. Courtyards or other green
spaces are ideal for retrofitting SuDS as part of general improvement works. The same is also true for
retrofitting to buildings it is likely to be most cost-efficient to retrofit SuDS to buildings as part of a wider
programme of repairs, renovation, upgrading or extension.
See the Derbyshire Street case study in Section 10.4.
Increasing economic and development pressures means that land in towns and cities is enormously
valuable. In some scenarios (particularly where retrofitting SuDS is being considered) the land
required for SuDS should be evaluated strategically through collaboration and partnership working with
stakeholders, so that potential benefits beyond site drainage and opportunities associated with joint
funding initiatives are identified.
Where retrofitting SuDS, there is also the need to optimise the multi-functionality of existing infrastructure.
For example:
Can existing gullies be used as exceedance/overflow routes for SuDS by adjusting levels of the
gulley grating?
Can bioretention systems or rain gardens be located upstream of existing gullies (Figure 10.11)?
Can existing kerbs/edges be removed or altered?
Can surface rills and channels be incorporated to replace below-ground drainage
Can green roofs be fitted to existing roof structures
Can downpipes be disconnected and redirected into plot level rain gardens?

10.1.5 Community engagement
Community engagement plays an important role in successful urban design
Community engagement can be critically important in the design of SuDS in urban areas, as neighbours
or existing residents often have a major say in development planning.
Community engagement is essential for the success of any proposed SuDS retrofit scheme, not only
to obtain acceptance, but also to identify opportunities for maximising benefits and in the long-term
to promote community ownership of the SuDS. SuDS schemes that have tangible benefits for the
community may be actively encouraged by residents, if they are well-informed. Working with local
environmental and other community groups can help to support, maintain and develop the SuDS and
surrounding area.
See the Augustenborg case study in Section 10.4.
Methods for increasing public awareness and encouraging engagement are discussed further in Chapter 34.
10.2 DELIVERING THE SUDS DESIGN CRITERIA WITHIN URBAN AREAS
SuDS can be used successfully in urban areas by following the design criteria described in Chapters 3–6 and
summarised in Table 10.1. Supplementary guidance on the specific opportunities and challenges associated
with designing and implementing SuDS in urban areas is presented in the Sections 10.2.1–10.2.10. Reference
should be made to Chapters 3–6 for further information, and where guidance is sufficient in those chapters for
individual design criteria, this is not repeated here.
Many of the design criteria are interrelated, and the total value that can be achieved for a development will
be greatest when they are considered collectively as part of an integrated urban design solution. Integrated
urban design requires the use of different SuDS components for different land uses and for different
development scenarios. It requires a collaborative or multi-disciplinary design process that brings together
engineers, planners, architects, landscape architects, developers and the local community.

10.2.1 Water quantity criterion 1: Use surface water runoff as a resource
SuDS provide a unique opportunity to exploit surface water runoff as a resource in urban areas, rather
than regarding it as a nuisance and a waste product that should be removed as quickly as possible.
In a dense urban environment, climate change scenarios may mean that periods of water scarcity
and associated controls on its use become more common, and the cost of water may rise. By taking
opportunities to capture and store runoff (particularly from roofs), a supply of non-potable water can be
secured and used either internally for the property (eg toilet flushing) or externally, such as landscape
irrigation, urban food growing or as an educational resource for children’s play areas (Figure 10.12).
Guidance on the design of rainwater harvesting systems for surface water management is provided in
Chapter 11. Rainwater storage tanks can be included on roof space (blue roofs), within roof space, above
ground within property curtilage, or below car parking areas.
Surface water runoff is also a valuable resource for the environment a regular flow of water (if suitably
treated) can help to sustain habitats that may otherwise be lost within the urban environment and can
provide crucial ecological connectivity between other water bodies nearby (Section 10.2.3).

a) Prioritise where surface water runoff is discharged
The destination for surface water runoff that is not collected for use should be prioritised as described in
Section 3.2.3 (part 1).
Discharge to existing surface water and combined sewers will sometimes be the only feasible options
in existing urban areas. Locating and characterising existing sewerage systems is an important task
to undertake early during the feasibility stages, together with consultation with the relevant sewerage
undertaker to scope potential opportunities and constraints.
b) Control the volume of runoff discharged from the site
Opportunities for infiltration within existing urban areas are often limited. This means that rainwater
harvesting and the use of evapotranspiration from temporary soil moisture (eg green roofs, tree pits,
bioretention and other vegetated systems) and gravel media storage zones (eg pervious pavements)
are important design tools for delivering Interception (ie volume control for frequent events). Where
opportunities for infiltration and rainwater harvesting are limited and cannot reduce runoff volumes
sufficiently for extreme events, then storage should be provided so that discharge rates can be controlled to
a level that will not adversely affect flood risk (Section 3.3.1).
c) Control peak runoff rates from the site
Usually, the most efficient way of designing storage and flow control systems in urban environments is to
store and control runoff in small distributed sub-catchments. All available opportunities to provide small-
scale surface water storage features should be considered, and the system can then be designed to
Chapter 10: Designing for the urban environment

CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015

provide the rest of the storage below ground. Combinations of rainwater harvesting systems, bioretention/
rain gardens, pervious surfaces, green/blue roofs, hardscape storage, microwetlands and trees can
usually provide more than sufficient storage volume.
Using small-scale storage features requires the control of relatively low flows. The most effective way
of doing this is to keep the head of water in the system low (ie the height of water above the orifice
level) so that the orifice opening can be as large as possible. Orifice diameters as small as 15 mm can
be acceptable provided that the opening is well protected from material that could potentially cause
a blockage (eg by placing the orifice downstream of pervious surfaces or a suitable, cleanable filter).
Guidance is provided in Chapter 28. Surface weirs can also be used to control flows from surface
features or along sloping conveyance systems as shown in Figure 10.13.
10.2.3 Water quantity criterion 4: Preserve and protect hydrological systems
Natural hydrological systems in existing urban environments will often have been damaged, culverted,
polluted or otherwise degraded. Redevelopment or infill development in urban areas can provide
opportunities to rehabilitate, protect and enhance these systems. Where the surface water management
system for the site can make a positive contribution to natural hydrological systems, this should be an
important design consideration.
Where practicable, consideration should be given to whether watercourses flowing through culverts within
urban areas can be returned to open channels with all the concomitant water quantity, water quality,
amenity and biodiversity benefits associated with surface systems. Runoff from the pre-development
site may have been of poor quality, but sediment and pollutant loadings can be significantly reduced by
treating the runoff using SuDS. Hydraulic control of the runoff will also help reduce erosion, morphological
damage and local flooding. Where existing hydrological features provide valuable local planting, habitats
and biodiversity, these should be preserved and enhanced by the SuDS wherever possible.
Existing urban areas may have highly compacted soils that are effectively impermeable to water. Where
possible and appropriate, opportunities should be taken to rehabilitate surface soils to promote infiltration.

Exceedance flows (ie flows in excess of those for which the system is designed) should be managed
safely in above-ground space such that risks to people and property are acceptable. Definitions of
acceptable risk should be sought from the local planning authority. Where space is limited, this often
means directing excess flows into roads. Safe storage ones and conveyance channels for extreme
events can be included as part of road or car park designs using raised kerbing or speed bumps as
containment features. Civic spaces, such as pocket parks, squares and plazas, can also be designed to
function as exceedance storage zones (Figure 10.14).
Figure 10.1 Multi-functional civic space
SuDS and exceedance flow management can form key design elements of linked blue and green
corridors as well as squares and public open areas. In Rotterdam, for example, retrofit public plaas are
used as excess runoff storage areas several times a year and as recreational areas at other times, as
illustrated in Figure 10.15. Some of these include green space, whereas others are paved to provide
sports facilities.
See the Benthemplein Water Square case study in Section 10.4.

Urbanisten)
Figure 10.15 Benthemplein Water Square, Rotterdam
Where SuDS discharge into a sewer (Section 10.2.2), the effect of water levels in the downstream sewer
on the operation of the SuDS should be considered. On many sites extra storage is required to reduce
the risk of site flooding when the downstream sewerage system is full and does not have sufficient
capacity to drain the site. Flap valves may also be required to prevent water from the sewer backing up
and flooding the site.
10.2.5 Water quality criterion 1: Support the management of water quality in receiving
surface waters and groundwaters
Runoff from roof surfaces within urban areas and runoff from pedestrian areas will require limited
treatment. Any surface that has vehicular use, however, will need to demonstrate that the proposed
treatment system is suitable to minimise risks to the receiving environment.
Treatment is normally achievable using soil or gravel filtration media systems (eg pervious pavement,
tree pits, bioretention systems) or through the use of planted conveyance and storage zones (eg swales,
wetlands/ponds). Where, due to space constraints, the surface water management system has to remain
largely beneath the surface, then proprietary treatment products may prove to be the most viable option.
Guidance on the design of SuDS for treatment is provided in Chapter 26.
10.2.6 Amenity criterion 1: Maximise multi-functionality
Section 10.1.3 discusses how designers should seek out every available space for SuDS. Designers
should also consider how that space can perform multiple functions. In urban areas, where the density
and impermeability of the development is high, this becomes particularly important and is best achieved
through collaboration (Section 10.1.1).
SuDS should be integrated into urban areas to ensure that competing requirements are managed, and
the urban landscape is hard-working’, that is it performs multiple tasks and provides multiple benefits
from even the smallest land-take. SuDS in urban areas should be considered alongside provision of
green infrastructure, delivery of biodiversity objectives and the creation of community amenities to
support urban lifestyle and function, where necessary finding a balance between competing needs.
Rain gardens/bioretention areas are an excellent example of how SuDS components can be integrated
into a streetscape with limited impact on the primary purpose of an urban space. They can be integrated
into a wide range of street features, such as on-street parking, pedestrian crossing points, spaces for
cycle storage, cycle hire stations and seating areas. They can also be used to assist traffic calming
measures, including gateways and build-outs.
Guidance on the design of rain gardens is provided in Chapter 18.
170 Part C: Applying the approach
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Pervious pavement is another important example of where hard surfacing for pedestrian, recreation or
vehicular use can be used for surface water management with limited impact on the primary purpose of
an urban space.
Guidance on the design of permeable paving is provided in Chapter 20.
See yoloy meium resiential infill in Section 10.3.
In particularly dense developments, where green space is minimal or may be completely absent, every
hard surface becomes a rainwater collector and every construction profile should be considered in terms
of its contribution to and potential for management of surface water runoff. Hard surfaces associated with
parking, footways and podiums can attenuate runoff, communal areas can accommodate rain event water
features and green roofs can be integrated to slow the runoff rates (Figure 10.17 in Section 10.3). For
further information.
See Typology 3: mixed use and Typology 6: elevated spaces
Figure 10.16 Multi-functional streetscape
10.2.7 Amenity criterion 2: Enhance visual character
SuDS design can play a significant role in enhancing the visual character of the urban environment, which
in turn contributes to multiple amenity benefits, as discussed in Chapter 5.
Within high-density urban environments, the quality of the detailing is very important as part of the overall
visual character for the site. These locations tend to have high footfall, so the detailing can have an
impact on a large number of people (both residents and visitors) and it is often seen close up. There can
also be constraints on ensuring that the design fits in with existing built form and planning expectations.
Chapter 10: Designing for the urban environment
171
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Figure 10.17 Multi-functional use of elevated spaces
It is important that SuDS design is sensitive to the
historic environment. This involves considering the
existing character and materials to ensure that the
proposals retain and enhance the historic setting.
It also requires high-quality (and often subtle)
detailing and finishes.
In some cases, SuDS already form part of the
heritage of the area, such as the roadside rills in
Cambridge (Figure 10.18).
Examples of opportunities for SuDS implementation
in historic environments include:
the use of permeable paving to enhance public
open space while controlling and treating runoff
the incorporation of green roofs onto
modern extensions to historic buildings
or in new developments or extensions in
conservation areas
the implementation of sensitively designed
water butts and/or rainwater harvesting
systems adjacent to or within historic buildings
the use of surface rills that reflect the
existing historic character within historic
hardscape areas.
Figure 10.18 Roadside rills, Cambridge (courtesy
Cambridgeshire County Council)
172 Part C: Applying the approach
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
The use of landscape features for storing surface water runoff will require consideration of the impact on
any trees in the vicinity and on any other landscape features of historic importance. Where infiltration is
proposed, this also needs to ensure that it does not undermine historic buildings or archaeology.
The designation of a conservation area does not mean that new development is prohibited, but it does
mean that any new development should make a positive contribution to the conservation area. Therefore,
good design and detailing, with due regard to the use of materials, existing green (and blue) spaces, sight
lines etc should meet the conservation area requirements.
Under the permitted development order, a council can make Article 4 (1 and 2) directions that withdraw
‘permitted development’ rights, which can affect existing features such as fence lines and trees. In
sensitive locations it is, therefore, advisable to consult the development control section of the LPA to
ascertain whether the work is permitted development and for advice on appropriate materials and design.
For listed buildings any external changes or additions required by SuDS need to be permitted by the local
planning department, who may consult the relevant statutory authority (English Heritage, Cadw, Historic
Scotland or NIEA). For grade 1 listing, any internal changes or additions will also need listed building
consent. As with conservation areas, any proposal should retain and enhance the reason for listing,
which means that consideration of materials and composition is important.
10.2.8 Amenity criterion 3: Deliver safe surface water management systems
The function and access requirements of the urban space should also be considered when designing SuDS
schemes. The risks to health and safety associated with the SuDS scheme should be assessed during the
early stages of the project and continually reviewed and reduced during the course of the project.
Considerations for safety when designing urban SuDS include the following:
Edge conditions and fall protection need to be considered at an early stage to prevent later additions of
barriers, which may clutter the landscape and prove detrimental to the overall character of the area.
When designing SuDS with open water, the location, water depth and edge detail should be
considered to protect the safety of users and workers. This does not discount their inclusion, but
highlights the need to design out risk and to consult relevant groups to ensure that the end product is
fit for purpose.
In tight urban spaces, shallow gradients may not be achievable and/or capacity requirements may
call for steeper gradients. In such cases, reinforced steeper gradients and hard edges may provide
a solution. If so, the edge detail needs to be considered to promote the safety of users and workers
to prevent falls. Detailed paving, wide edge details with contrasting colours and planting can all
promote a safe barrier-free landscape. For ground level features that are close to houses, schools
or along busy pedestrian areas it may be best to use features that are normally dry with subsurface
flow. In extreme events the water could be allowed to rise and gradually drain away.
Runoff entering permanent water features should be treated by at least one treatment stage before
discharge into the feature to minimise health risks (Chapter 26).
Planting within any SuDS component needs to retain sightlines and avoid hidden or heavily shaded
spaces, such as raising tree canopies to ensure that people can walk beneath them and see through
them. The maintenance of sightlines is vital to ensure that vehicles can be manoeuvred safely and
that all signage is visible. This also provides a degree of natural observation within the public realm
and allows individuals to assess their personal security (see below).
Opportunities for crime reduction should be identified by adopting the secure by design’ approach,
achieved by crime prevention through environmental design (CPTED).
The location and/or load-bearing capacity of SuDS components should be reviewed to ensure that other
features, such as building facades, can be maintained and accessed safely.
Reference should be made to the health and safety checklist provided in Appendix B.

CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
10.2.9 Amenity criterion 4: Support development resilience/adaptability to future change
Urban spaces are always changing, as they adapt to the community they serve, advancements in
technology and the unavoidable deterioration of physical features. For instance, street furniture and
lamps may need replacing within a decade hard surfaces often need repairing or replacing due to
wear every other decade, or reinstating after below-ground works there can be shifts in the needs for
public and private transport and there may even be changes in surface water runoff characteristics due
to climate change or increased development within the SuDS catchment area. This means that there
may be a need to upgrade as well as maintain the functionality of the SuDS scheme, while also being
mindful of the evolving design and function of the urban space. These changes or upgrades may provide
additional or new opportunities for SuDS.
In order to prevent inappropriate interventions or loss of key SuDS components within a scheme,
it is important that stakeholders understand the roles of different components, particularly if there
are components on their land. Therefore, consideration should be given to finding ways to embed
knowledge within the community and to ensure that this knowledge is retained over the long term.
Providing signage and making the scheme legible (see Amenity design criterion 5, Chapter 5) will
contribute to this. Listing the components on an asset register can also be beneficial, and is mandatory
for some developments.
It is important to take account of repair and replacement needs of SuDS components, recognising that
different elements of a SuDS component can have different durability levels. Where SuDS components
(or elements of a SuDS component) have a shorter design life than the SuDS scheme as a whole, the
design should take into consideration how they will be replaced to retain the functionality of the scheme
(Chapter 35). Planters, rills, channels and kerb stones can be designed as simple units to enable
repositioning, alterations, adaptations and improvements over time.
Retrofitted SuDS should ensure that street surfaces retain good access to all underground services.
Wherever possible, services should be located in specific service corridors that are surfaced with normal
construction. Some services may end up below the pervious surface, and the backfill to the trench should
be specified so that it cannot be washed out by infiltrating water. Consideration also needs to be given to
reinstatement requirements for statutory undertakers.
10.2.10 Amenity criterion 6: Support community environmental learning
The opportunities for deriving benefits from SuDS relating to environmental learning will often be greater
in urban settings. A green or blue biodiverse feature (either in a streetscape, public area or on an
accessible roof) is likely to be unusual and therefore of particular interest and value for local community
environment groups, schools and visitors/tourists (Section 5.2.7).
10.3 DIFFERENT URBAN DEVELOPMENT TYPOLOGIES
A set of typologies has been developed to represent a range of urban conditions and to demonstrate
the opportunities for integrating SuDS into their design. These typologies are not intended to be
comprehensive they are solely illustrative. The illustrations for each typology should not be followed rigidly.
The illustrations are simlifie representations of abstracted urban conditions aimed at showing how
an integrated design might be achieved. The connections between SuDS components are indicated in a
simplified form, as fully designed connections would be too complicated to show on these schematics. For
each typology there will be a range of other potential surface water management solutions.
These ideas should be developed, enhanced and moulded to individual sites and budgets, so that they
work with the specific opportunities and constraints of the site and fit in with the local character, while
delivering as many benefits as possible.
Each typology includes a range of SuDS components that can be delivered individually or in combination.
Not all real-life schemes will be able to include all of the SuDS components shown for that particular
typology. Equally SuDS components that are not shown are not discounted from any particular typology.
174 Part C: Applying the approach
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
The preferred SuDS scheme for any site (whether it is one of the typologies presented here or not) will
depend on strategic objectives for surface water management and the characteristics of the site and
proposed development.
Guidance on the SuDS design process is provided in Chapter 7.
For guidance on how to design individual SuDS components see Chapters 11–23.
All the typologies are designed to apply primarily to new infill developments within existing urban
conurbations. However, the majority of SuDS components shown could equally be retrofit to existing
urban development.
The site for each typology is assumed to have the following characteristics:
not suitable for infiltration
free from contamination
These characteristics are not necessarily representative of all sites within existing urban areas.

Figure 10.19 illustrates how these different typologies can coexist within the urban landscape.

Summaries of the typologies are provided here.
oo Sma residentia infi
Low-density housing of detached and semi-detached dwellings. Typically this type of housing is located
on sites with moderate space availability, which allow front and rear gardens, on-street public parking and
off-street private parking, along with clear boundaries between public and private land. It is also assumed
that these are relatively high value properties, based on the land-take within an urban setting.
oo edium residentia infi
Medium-density housing development of apartments and maisonette style dwellings, typically low rise
over two to three floors. The development is assumed to have combined utilities and services along with
community gardens and limited on-street parking.
Typology 3 – Mixed use
Mixed-use development within moderate to high-density inner city location. Assumed to have retail and/
or commercial space at lower levels beneath upper level residential apartments and private residential
amenities deck/garden. Assumed to have public realm interfaces, surface and basement parking
provision and associated servicing and access requirements.
Typology 4 – Destination public realm
An inner city space that provides a community focus, event areas and social function. These spaces can
be hard paved squares and plazas or softer spaces associated with urban greening. Either way they are
required to be flexible to accommodate the urban social calendar and variable numbers of people.
Typology 5 – Transitional public realm
An inner city space that is dominated by access requirements and confined by the existing built form.
The design and SuDS opportunities of these spaces can often be challenging. Therefore this typology
aims to provide ideas and insights to enable efficient and effective integration of SuDS in even the
smallest urban spaces.
Typology 6 – Elevated spaces
This typology explores design of urban SuDS above ground level, from green walls and green roofs to
amenity podium decks associated with residential and mixed-use developments.
Typology 7 – Neighbourhood street
Inner city streets that act as a local road or main road into residential areas, often with restricted space
availability within existing built form and infrastructure. Residential neighbourhoods require a streetscape
that may require parking provision, public transport links, ease of access into dwellings, servicing and
trash collection, clear land ownership between public/private, along with adequate setbacks for privacy
and regulation.
Typology 8 – Civic street
Inner city streets that have a community function and focus within a commercial setting. These streets
often have changing characters, one day a retail street and the next market stalls and pop-up cafes. This
typology demonstrates how SuDS can be integrated into these flexible civic spaces.
Typology 9 – Greenway
Inner city green corridors and disused historic infrastructure routes that become key pedestrian and cycle
routes, connecting the city away from built-up areas, traffic and crowds. These spaces provide valuable

social and biodiverse landscapes as well as connective green infrastructure, while forming an important
part of the urban SuDS strategy.

located on sites with moderate space availability, which allow front and rear gardens, on-street
public parking and off-street private parking, along with clear boundaries between public and
private land t is also assumed that these are relatively high value properties based on the
landtae within an urban setting
Design approach
Small residential infill should take advantage of the space allocated to each plot, providing SuDS
components that would often not be feasible in denser residential developments. All SuDS design should
also aim to enhance and promote local character to optimise land value and neighbourhood desirability.
Considerations
Whether retrofit or new build, each plot should ideally be able to attenuate and treat its own runoff with
on-plot SuDS components. However, with impermeable conditions and confined sites this may not be
feasible, but runoff rates can still be reduced.
For new build, it should also be a design ethos to combine components as part of a neighbourhood-wide
strategy. This approach should take into consideration the shared spaces and streetscape to enable
greater consideration of scale, which helps with managing exceedance events and provides informal
community spaces. The local highway authority would need to be consulted in these scenarios.
Integrating SuDS components such as bioretention systems with strategic tree planting and underdrained
swales can aid the creation of leafy green streets, which in turn can support higher land/property
values. To achieve this, the width of streetscape needs to be considered at the early design stages (see
Typology 7 for further information).
With a neighbourhood-wide approach, the ownership and maintenance of SuDS need consideration, as
some components may cross over plot boundaries and highway boundaries.
Potential SuDS components
Rainwater harvesting systems overflow into on-plot rain gardens.
Green roofs over the garage overflow into driveway attenuation.
Shared driveways and patios are drained using lined pervious pavements with sub-base storage.
Rain gardens and sub-base storage slowly drain into underdrained swales and bioretention areas in highways.
The public footpath is drained into an underdrained swale which may also collect outflow from the
on-plot SuDS components.
The public highway is drained with a single drainage profile into a bioretention area that incorporates
tree planting. The bioretention area integrates pervious on-street parking and access into driveways.
The underdrained swale and the bioretention area convey water into a local detention basin if space
is available.
The green roofs, rain gardens, underdrained swale and the bioretention area all play an important
role in treating surface water runoff.
utie benefits
The underdrained swale and on-plot rain gardens provide a privacy strip along the property frontages.
Biodiversity is supported by the on-plot green roofs and rain gardens, along with the public highway
swales and bioretention areas with tree planting.
Visual quality of the streetscape is enhanced with the provision of leafy green streets.

oo edium residentia infi
Medium density housing development of apartments and maisonette style dwellings typically

Design approach
Residential infill projects should deliver multiple benefits from good urban design and SuDS. This will
embed SuDS components and support a range of amenities and services required by the community.
SuDS in compact new-build residential areas should therefore give consideration to access, service
routes, utilities, green infrastructure, biodiversity and community facilities such as outdoor dining areas,
seating provision and productive zones.
Considerations
Measures can be small and simple with minimal investment, such as rain gardens, or more complex with
greater investment, such as below-ground storage tanks. Even the simplest surface water management
techniques are beneficial, but systems with greater diversity are inherently more adaptable to the
changing urban climate. The ambition should therefore be to provide a range of SuDS components within
a site-wide surface water management system.
Potential SuDS components
Rainwater harvesting (integrated into roof level), green roofs and terraces attenuate roof runoff and
overflow into below-ground storage tanks within communal areas.
Hard surfaces are drained using pervious pavements with sub-base storage, which discharge into
adjacent bioretention systems and trench planters.
Bioretention systems and trench planters convey, attenuate and treat surface water, slowly
discharging into a local detention basin if space is available.
The vehicle carriageway is drained with an inverted drainage profile with surface catchment channels
that discharge into a local detention basin (if space is available) or the local drainage system.
The green roofs, planted trenches and bioretention systems all play an important role in treating
surface water runoff.
utie benefits
Stored water can be recirculated to tap points within the communal garden and within private
courtyards and terraces for landscape maintenance and irrigation.
The planted trenches provide a privacy strip along the property frontages to reaffirm personal
boundaries and support urban greening.
A communal garden provides outdoor recreation and gathering space.
The private roof terraces and courtyards provide outdoor recreation and gathering spaces.
Biodiversity is supported by the green roofs and communal gardens.
Local amenities are enhanced with the provision of communal gardens.

Design approach
Mixed-use developments should take advantage of their scale and extent, providing SuDS components
that would often not be feasible in smaller single use developments. Therefore, the approach to SuDS
within mixed use development should start at a strategic level with site-wide consideration of economies
of scale.
Considerations
The public boundary condition of a mixed use development is a key contributor to character and
community engagement. Considering the SuDS as part of this condition will utilise the space efficiently
while enhancing urban greening and streetscape quality.
Site services can be a dominant influence on layout and design. Requirements such as vehicle and
pedestrian movement, building access, servicing, maintenance, utility routes, parking capacity, street
furniture, green infrastructure and drainage all need to be established during the early design stages to
ensure that the proposed scheme avoids conflicts with SuDS.
Mixed-use developments often require parking provision, and this space can almost always be utilised for
SuDS. The layout and levels should be designed to maximise the potential for site-wide water management.
Amenity podium decks associated with residential and office developments provide an opportunity to
store water and attenuate flow, while enhancing character and improve amenity provision. For further
details refer to Typology 6.
With a site-wide approach the ownership and maintenance of SuDS needs consideration, as some SuDS
components may cross boundaries.
Potential SuDS components
Green roofs treat and attenuate runoff in their substrate and support root uptake with extensive
planting. Geocellular storage layers can maximise the attenuation provided.
Rainwater harvesting (integrated into roof/basement level) supports the buildings’ non-potable water
requirements (including residential, office and commercial).
Green roofs overflow into the car park attenuation.
Private terraces and communal amenity deck use pervious surfaces over geocellular storage
layers (hard and soft) to attenuate roof runoff and overflow into parking area sub-base storage and
boundary bioretention/detention areas.
Car park is drained using pervious pavements with sub-base storage, which discharge into adjacent
bioretention/detention areas.
Exceedance event capacity is provided within the car park using high kerbs and level changes to
temporarily retain water.
Pedestrian circulation spaces are drained using pervious pavements with sub-base storage, which
discharge into adjacent bioretention systems.
Bioretention systems convey, attenuate and treat surface water, slowly discharging into a boundary
detention basin, if space is available.

Typology 4 – Destination public realm
An inner city space that provides a community focus event areas and social function hese
spaces can be hard paved squares and plazas or softer spaces associated with urban
greening Either way they are reuired to be flexible to accommodate the urban social calendar
and variable numbers of people
Design approach
Inner city pocket parks, squares and plazas create openings in the urban form that provide rare
opportunities to collect and treat the surface water runoff from a wider area. To use the space efficiently,
the design should aim to accommodate the social and functional needs of a community alongside the
needs of SuDS.
Considerations
Before the design process can begin, a high-level review of the location’s SuDS performance
requirements (ie attenuation, storage, and treatment) is needed, as this will inform the design process.
Incorporating large-scale SuDS components into the public realm takes planning and consultation it is
important that the design process recognises the purpose of the new park/plaza, so that SuDS components
do not conflict with that purpose, are integrated efficiently and are accepted by the local community.
SuDS components need to work with the functional requirements of the public realm, including: vehicle
and pedestrian movement, building access, servicing, maintenance, utility routes, street parking, street
furniture, green infrastructure and drainage.
Potential SuDS components
During frequent rain events the surface water is collected and stored below the park’s surface,
slowly releasing into the existing local drainage system.
During exceedance events the park provides a temporary storage area, which enables the surface
water runoff to be gradually released into the local drainage system. The change in level that defines
the area could be used to provide seating or a performance arena. An overflow that discharges to
the local drainage system should be provided to set the maximum exceedance water level.
The hard surfaces surrounding the central green space are drained using pervious pavements with
sub-base storage, which discharge into the below-ground attenuation of the park.
Adjacent roof catchments can be drained into the central space via the pervious pavements and
combined tree trenches placed along the conveyance route to provide natural irrigation.
utie benefits
The park provides a public green space with a distinct and dynamic character.
The park can support local community events, promote a local identity and aid wayfinding through
the creation of a landmark.
The educational value can be maximised to inform users of the park’s SuDS function, which they
can witness themselves during exceedance events.
Biodiversity is supported by the park’s planting strategy, which could include a range of flora to suit
the variable planting conditions.
Accessibility is retained by incorporating combined tree trenches below hard surfaces.

Typology 5 – Transitional public realm
An inner city space that is dominated by access reuirements and confined by the existing built
form he design and SuS opportunities of these spaces can often be challenging herefore
this typology aims to provide ideas and insights to enable efficient and effective integration of
SuS in even the smallest urban spaces
Design approach
Within these transitional urban spaces, SuDS should be seen as a sequence of simple components that
combine to form a site-wide strategy. Therefore, implementing what may seem a small gesture adds to
the bigger picture to meet the attenuation and reduced runoff rate targets.
Considerations
Confined inner city spaces between buildings or major infrastructure often require complex access
and circulation patterns. This inevitably results in extensive areas of hard surfaces that may also be
heavily trafficked, which can limit the feasibility of some SuDS components. Pervious pavements and
underground storage/attenuation are usually the most applicable methods in these scenarios, allowing
people to move freely through a space with wall-to-wall hard surfaces. The below-ground attenuation can
be just below the surface within the pavement build-up or deeper within large tanks and combined with
tree pits/trenches. All systems can receive runoff from surfaces and adjacent roofscapes.
Opportunities to animate the public realm with SuDS components should be embraced, as this increases
awareness and supports localised character. Animation can take many forms, including surface water
features, sound sculptures linked to underground tanks, digital displays that show water movement and
quantity, and other information sources about what is happening below ground.
Potential SuDS components
The hard surfaces are drained using lined pervious pavements with sub-base storage, which discharge
into the local drainage system or SuDS components further down the site-wide Management Train.
During heavier frequent rain events the surface water is also collected via inverted drainage profiles
leading to surface channels, which discharge into a defined one to create a rain event water
feature. This water feature slowly drains into the below-ground attenuation.
During exceedance events, sunken features, such as seating areas, can provide a temporary
storage area, which enables the surface water runoff to be gradually released into the local drainage
system. An overflow that discharges to the local drainage system should be provided to set the
maximum exceedance water level.
Adjacent roof catchments can be drained into the space via the pervious pavements.
Combined tree trenches placed along the conveyance route provide natural irrigation for the trees
and attenuate runoff rates.
utie benefits
Trees provide evapotranspiration, urban greening, shade and shelter, wildlife habitat and seasonality.
The rain event water features provide a distinct and dynamic character.
The space can promote a local identity and aid wayfinding through the creation of a landmark.
The educational value can be maximised to inform users of the space’s SuDS function, which they
can witness themselves during regular rainfall events and exceedance events.
Accessibility and the urban character is retained by incorporating combined tree trenches below
hard surfaces.

Typology 6 – Elevated spaces
This typology explores design of urban SuDS above ground level, from green walls and green
roofs to amenity podium decs associated with residential and mixeduse developments
Design approach
Within high density urban developments elevated landscapes are key factors for the provision of private/
semi-private outdoor spaces and urban greening. All urban projects should aim to use integrated SuDS
components to provide opportunities to enhance character and amenity provision.
Considerations
Intensive and extensive green roofs can help reduce (and for frequent events often eliminate) the volume
of runoff from the roof surface and, with suitable design, help slow runoff rates. Attenuation and treatment
can then be delivered by incorporating further SuDS components into deck structures and planters.
SuDS within elevated landscapes have a series of considerations to ensure their functionality:
The waterproofing of any substructure needs to be considered and co-ordinated.
Potential loading of water, soil and the live load of plants needs to be calculated in all structural design.
Future maintenance and management needs to be considered during the early design stages.
Roof-level mechanical and electrical plant and penetrations can be combined with attenuation
and storage components, but the extent of plant and penetrations needs to be reviewed to ensure
efficiency of scale. Roof-level attenuation tends to remove the need for multiple deck penetrations
and underslung pipework below podium decks.
Biodiversity viability and value should be as important for elevated spaces as elsewhere, and
needs to be considered when selecting plant species, optimising the habitat potential for the local
flora and fauna.
Potential SuDS components
Green roofs reduce runoff by storing water in their substrate and supporting root uptake and
evapotranspiration with extensive planting. Geocellular storage or other drainage layers can
maximise the attenuation provided.
Green walls can also help reduce runoff volumes. However, consideration should always be given to
the potential need for a supplementary supply of water other than from rainwater harvesting, which
may mean they are not economic or environmentally acceptable solutions.
Ledge planters can act as treatment biotopes, conveying rainwater from the roof to lower levels
through granular fill and plant root ones.
Roof terraces can be drained using pervious surfaces over geocellular storage, which discharge into
downstream SuDS components.
Podium decks can provide a large area of attenuation by using pervious surfaces (hard and soft)
over geocellular storage, which discharge into downstream SuDS components.
During heavier frequent rain events, runoff can be directed into rain event water features.
utie benefits
Green roofs and green walls can help insulate buildings and reduce the urban heat island effect.
Natural irrigation of green walls, can be supplemented with stored rainwater (from rainwater
harvesting) in times of drought.
Trees provide evapotranspiration, urban greening, shade and shelter, wildlife habitat and seasonality.
188 Part C: Applying the approach

The rain event water features provide a distinct and dynamic character, animating the space and
increasing awareness of water.

CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Typology 7 – Neighbourhood street
Urban streets that act as a local road or main road into residential areas, often with restricted
space availability within the existing built form and infrastructure Residential neighbourhoods
require a streetscape that may contain: public transport links; parking provision; ease of
access into dwellings; servicing and trash collection; clear land ownership between public/
private along with adeuate setbacs for privacy and regulation
Design approach
The design of SuDS should focus on space efficiency and consistency to meet the functional and
aesthetic demands of the streetscape.
Considerations
Simply providing the minimum space for carriageway and footway is not usually enough to support a
sustainable urban design with integrated SuDS. During the master planning stages of a project, the street
width needs to be realistic, that is wide enough to accommodate all the functions needed to support
vehicle and pedestrian movement, building access, servicing, maintenance, utility routes, street parking,
street furniture, green infrastructure and drainage. The dimensions of these elements will vary.
New-build streetscape should aim to include a linear element that acts as a multi-functional one,
combining parking, crossing points, traffic calming, green infrastructure, rain gardens, combined utility
route and pedestrian footways. The width of this linear element is defined by the parking provision
(parallel or perpendicular with the road) and the footway width. Filter strips and swales can also
be incorporated, although they do require wider areas which need consideration during the master
planning process.
Streetscape is often composed of public and private land, for instance in this typology public highway with
footpath and private front gardens. Therefore when designing SuDS in the streetscape a door-to-door
approach should be adopted to ensure that the space is fully utilised. For this typology, plot boundaries are
clearly defined by building and fence lines, but the SuDS elements will need to flow across the boundaries.
Potential SuDS components
Rainwater harvesting components overflow into on-plot rain gardens.
Shared driveways and footpaths are drained using lined pervious pavements with sub-base storage.
Rain gardens and sub-base storage slowly drain into highways trench planters, underdrained swales
and/or bioretention systems.
Trench planters collect, convey and treat runoff from adjacent footways and potentially roof catchment
via downpipes. These can take the form of ground-level planted channels and/or raised planters.
The public footpath is drained using lined pervious pavements with sub-base storage which
discharge into the trench planters or bioretention systems.
The public highway is drained with a single drainage profile into a bioretention system that
incorporates tree planting and integrates pervious on-street parking and access into driveways.
The trench planter and the bioretention system convey water into a local detention basin if space is
available or the local drainage system.
The trench planters and bioretention system with tree pits play an important role in treating surface
water runoff.
utie benefits
Multi-functional ones use space efficiently by combining street trees, on-street parking provision,
footway, pedestrian crossing points, spaces for cycle storage, seating area etc. They can also be
190 Part C: Applying the approach

used to assist the traffic calming strategy through the creation of gateways that narrow the street
width and therefore slow traffic speed.
The trench planters and on-plot rain gardens provide a privacy strip along the property frontages.
Biodiversity is supported by the on-plot rain gardens, along with the public highway trench planters
and bioretention systems with tree planting.
Local character is enhanced with the provision of leafy green streets.

Typology 8 – Civic street
nner city streets that have a community function and focus within a commercial setting hese
streets often have changing characters, one day a retail street and the next market stalls and pop-
up cafes his typology demonstrates how SuS can be integrated into these flexible civic spaces
Design approach
Unlike the clearly defined plot boundaries of Typology 7 , civic streets have blurred boundaries where
highways and public realm merge with private commercial frontages that are open to the public. This
imposes different pressures and priorities on the streetscape, which can be used to the advantage of
SuDS. Therefore, when designing SuDS in the civic streetscape, a door-to-door approach should be
adopted to ensure that the space is fully utilised.
Considerations
Civic environments need to be flexible to accommodate a variable calendar of events, an influx of people
and traffic, higher levels of delivery and trash access, temporary street furniture and the desire for open
frontages along retail and commercial properties. These elements should be used to define the street
dimensions along with green infrastructure requirements defined by the local planning department and
the functions outlined in Typology 7.
The parking provision and spill-out spaces associated with retail and commercial frontages provide flexible
space for civic use, for example market stalls, parades and commercial launch events. There are a number
of issues associated with these events in terms of visual clutter, waste/debris and vehicular congestion in
the area during set-up and take-down. Therefore the event process and required infrastructure needs to be
considered at an early design stage to prevent the later removal of SuDS components.
With a door-to-door approach the ownership and maintenance of SuDS needs consideration, as some
SuDS components may cross boundaries.
Potential SuDS components
The carriageway provides an exceedance event flood path.
Combined tree trenches placed along the conveyance route provide natural irrigation for the trees
and attenuate runoff rates, with outflow to the local drainage system.
The public footpath and hard paved areas are drained using pervious pavements with sub-base
storage which discharge into the bioretention systems.
The public highway is drained with a single drainage profile into a bioretention system that
incorporates tree planting. The bioretention system integrates pervious on-street parking and
pedestrian crossings.
The trench planter and the bioretention system convey water into a local detention basin if space is
available or the local drainage system.
The bioretention systems and tree pits play an important role in treating surface water runoff.
utie benefits
The space is used efficiently by combining street trees, bus stops, on-street parking provision,
footway, pedestrian crossing points, spaces for cycle storage, seating areas etc. SuDS can also be
used to assist the traffic calming strategy through the creation of gateways that narrow the street
width and, therefore, slow traffic speed.
Biodiversity is supported by the bioretention systems and tree planting.
Local character is enhanced with the provision of leafy green streets.

Typology 9 – Greenway
Inner city green corridors and disused historic infrastructure routes that become key pedestrian
and cycle routes connecting the city away from builtup areas traffic and crowds hese spaces
provide valuable social and biodiverse landscapes as well as connective green infrastructure,
while forming an important part of the SuS strategy for urban regeneration proects
Design approach
Connectivity across urban landscapes supports healthy communities and promotes neighbourhood
liveability. Historically, these routes are associated with canals or disused railways and historic
infrastructure. Urban design master plans should consider integrating these features as purpose-made
connective landscapes that also support the neighbourhood SuDS strategy.
Considerations
An important purpose of these green corridors should be to facilitate movement of people. Therefore path
widths need to be suitable for all the intended users, and the predicted peak flow of people. Alongside
this, the scale of strategic tree planting should also be incorporated, ensuring that the trees have enough
space to mature.
SuDS components can be integrated with the tree planting but, where space allows, larger purpose-built
SuDS components can also be used, such as detention basins and underdrained swales.
Directing runoff from frequent events into the greenways will provide natural irrigation for planting while
treating runoff and providing a degree of natural attenuation.
Potential SuDS components
Surface water runoff from adjacent streets and footways is directed into the greenway.
Kerb drainage and channels keep the runoff on the surface with single drainage profiles to direct
runoff into linear SuDS components.
Incorporating landforms and deep planted troughs form flood channels, acting as detention basins
during exceedance events.
Underdrained grass areas use subsurface filter drains.
Below-surface soakaways can be beneath planted areas or hard surfaces (only suitable for areas
with adequate infiltration rates).
A high level of strategic tree planting will increase runoff volume reduction.
The hard surfaces surrounding the greenway are drained using pervious pavements with sub-base
storage which discharge into the below-ground attenuation components.
utie benefits
The greenway provides a public green space.
The greenway connects the local community and promotes a local identity.
Seating provision and gathering spaces enable people to interact with each other and their environment.
The educational value can be maximised to inform users of the greenway’s SuDS function, which
they can witness themselves during exceedance events.
Biodiversity is supported by the greenway planting strategy, which could include a range of flora to
suit the variable planting conditions.

Bristol Harbourside
Bristol Harbourside is a 6.6 ha mixed-use development on the edge of the city’s floating harbour,
which has regenerated the heart of Bristol’s historic waterfront. The project creates a series of spaces
and routes to enhance the floating harbour’s wider public realm, including new public squares, tree-
lined avenues and harbourside moorings with a new harbour inlet.
As a brownfield site, potential pollutants from the site’s former use needed to be managed.
Runoff from roofs and pavements is conveyed through the public realm via a series of collection
dishes, channels and rills.
Runoff is used to irrigate the planted areas and enhance the character of the spaces with sound
and motion.
Along the harbour edge floating reed beds filter the runoff as it enters the harbour, providing
valuable habitat opportunities and an attractive waterside setting.
Trees and other planted areas provide Interception and infiltration.
Green roofs and green walls are incorporated within the new buildings.

Derbyshire Street
The eastern end of Derbyshire Street was a dead-end road that only served as a space for 12 parking
bays, suffering from fly-tipping and providing opportunities for anti-social behaviour. The pocket park
concept was developed to provide a stronger social function with a cycle lane and an outdoor café
space. Core to the design philosophy was managing surface water runoff within the park and, in turn,
reducing the potential for flooding locally and within the wider catchment area.
A planted rain garden receives surface water runoff from the hard surfaces running the length of
the street and provides a physical barrier between the cycle lane and the outdoor café space.
Downpipes have been redirected into attenuating planters, providing water storage as well as
overflowing into the rain garden.
Permeable paving with infiltration into the ground is provided within the outdoor caf space.
A swale captures runoff and takes excess water from the rain garden, allowing it to soak
into the ground, as well as providing a physical barrier between the cycle lane and adjacent
residential flats.
Green roofs have also been installed to provide Interception and attenuate runoff, attracting birds,
butterflies and bees.

Rathbone Market is a high-density mixed-use development in east London, including social and
private housing (650 homes) and 20 000 m2 of commercial space. It provides high-quality open space
for residents as well as managing surface water runoff on site in order to limit discharge to the local
drainage system.
A pond provides a central visual feature, with plants around its margins designed to make the
water relatively inaccessible. It can accommodate a 200 mm rise in water level following rainfall,
providing 40 m3 of storage.
Treatment is provided by a filter bed beneath the planting at the edge of the pond, plus a silt trap.
Biodiverse roofs, with planting substrate and plug plants, provide Interception and attenuation of
runoff before it drains down to podium level.
The lowest level roof is not planted, but has a series of allotment beds for use by the residents.
A water butt is provided to collect rainwater from an adjacent roof for use on the allotments. The
paving around the beds is also designed to collect runoff, which drains to the pond.
A living wall absorbs noise and the water features also provide white noise to reduce the impact
of the noise from the nearby main road.
Future phases of development will include green and brown roofs with storage beneath the planting
substrate using an open cellular storage system. The capacity of these roofs will be around 110 m3

and forms one of three new parks in the Pearl District.
Formerly a contaminated industrial site, ground conditions do not allow infiltration.
Artwork in the park depicts the city’s previous industrial landscape, adding further to the sense of place.
The rainwater that falls within the curb-line of the park is fed into a pond with planted margins via
a native grassland area and wetland, providing a natural treatment system.
The SuDS scheme discharges to Tanner Creek, which at one time flowed openly through the site.
During dry spells the pond water is recirculated to keep the system active.

The project focused on reducing impermeable surfaces, creating green spaces and utilising
above-ground SuDS including green roofs, downpipe redirection to open ditches and channels

Benthemplein Water Square
The Water Square at Benthemplein, near the city centre of Rotterdam, is a retrofit scheme designed
to manage an increasing problem of urban flooding by disconnecting urban runoff from the combined
system, while also maximising the amenity value of an underused urban square.
Three detention basins collect and store surface water runoff two shallow basins are used
during all rainfall events and the third deeper basin is only used for large events.
Runoff is collected from the paved areas in the square and the surrounding area including roofs of
the surrounding buildings.
Runoff is conveyed via large stainless steel gutters into the basins.
The two shallow basins allow infiltration, while the deep basin provides attenuation before
discharge to a nearby canal.
The deep basin has a hard-court sports pitch surrounded by terraced seating. The gutters and
one of the shallow basins are designed to be fit for use by skaters.
Planters have been positioned alongside areas of pedestrian movement and emphasise places
where people can stop and enjoy the space.
The planting has been selected to provide vibrant bright colours in summer and soft muted
colours in winter.
The colour scheme for the hard landscaping uses blues where water is stored and stainless steel
for conveyance routes.
The community was closely involved in the development of the design, setting the objectives of
providing a dynamic place for young people, lots of space for play and meeting places, pleasant
green secluded areas and the stimulating use of water.

Rainwater harvesting
This chapter provides guidance on the design of rainwater harvesting
systems for surface water management, that is storage systems that
collect runoff within the boundary of a property (from roofs and/or
surrounding surfaces for use on site where the use is sufficiently great
to ensure that storage of runoff is achievable for most rainfall events.
Appendix C, Section C.5.3 demonstrates how to design a rainwater harvesting
system for a supermarket.
11.1 GENERAL DESCRIPTION
Rainwater harvesting (RWH) is the collection of rainwater runoff for use. Runoff can be
collected from roofs and other impermeable areas, stored, treated (where required) and
then used as a supply of water for domestic, commercial, industrial and/or institutional
properties. RWH systems have a number of key benefits
They can meet some of the building’s water demand, delivering sustainability and
climate resilience benefits.
They can help reduce the volume of runoff from a site.
They can help reduce the volume of attenuation storage required on the site.
Where the runoff is from trafficked areas, the potential for harvesting will depend on
the proposed use of the water, the extent of pollution and the treatment provided. The
collected water can generally be used for a range of non-potable purposes, such as
flushing toilets, washing machines (which may require adaptation) and for external uses
such as car washing and irrigation. RWH systems are rarely used to provide potable
water for consumption or bathing in the UK, as this requires specialised treatment and
monitoring to manage the contamination risks. In the UK, private water supplies for
locations not connected to main water supply networks have to comply with the Private
Water Supplies Regulations 2009.
Figure 11.1 (courtesy Stormsaver)
Rainwater harvesting storage tanks for domestic and commercial application
RWH systems are designed to a specific level of service, which may address water
supply only (water conservation systems) or surface water management as well (via
the inclusion of further storage capacity). Provided the system is designed for supply
purposes (ie it has a regular daily demand), RWHs can be considered to deliver
Chapter 11: Rainwater harvesting
207
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Interception for the contributing impermeable area and to reduce the runoff volume. This is the focus of
the design methods proposed in this chapter. However, designing systems for water conservation (supply)
only is also included for completeness and comparison purposes.
Much of the cost of an RWH system is related to the provision of a storage tank, the pump and the power,
controls and the pipework required for its operation. The cost of providing an additional 1 to m of
storage will therefore usually lead to a relatively small increase in the total system cost. For a property
with a roof of 50 m2 the additional storage needed to capture a 60 mm (total depth) rainfall event would
commonly be around m.
The principal documents that provide guidance on the design of RWH systems are as follows
BS 5152009A1201 Rainwater harvesting systems. Code of practice

EA (2010) Harvesting rainwater for domestic uses: an information guide.
Although water butts are often regarded as a form of RWH, in practice their value is limited to domestic
watering during dry periods when there is garden water in the container. Water butts do not guarantee
that storage will always be available, unless the system is designed so that any water stored above a set
threshold drains slowly to the downstream drainage system or to a soakaway. However, there is no robust
evidence regarding the potential effectiveness of such components during significant events and no
guidance on the sie of orifice and storage volume that may be required to ensure suitable performance
levels. Modelling would, therefore, be required.
Table 11.1 summarises the different possible objectives for RWH systems and the implications for
their design.
There are three main types of RWH system
gravity-based systems
pumped systems
composite systems
These are described in the following sections. In all cases there is a need to ensure that, if the store of non-
potable water is depleted, an appropriate alternative supply of water is available for the relevant appliances.

RWH objectives and design implications
RWH for water conservation (supply) only
The RWH system is designed to supply water to the building that it serves. The storage provided is sied to capture
and retain an appropriate volume of runoff from the contributing surface (the yield) to meet the projected building
use requirements (the demand).
Although a proportion of the runoff from large events will normally be captured, the performance of such systems
to manage extreme events cannot be relied upon, and therefore any potential contribution to surface water
management should not be allowed as part of the design.
RWH for water conservation (supply) and surface water management, passive systems
The tanks for these systems are sied to accommodate the storage required for water supply plus the storage
required to manage a specific depth of rainfall during a large event.
The term passive refers to the fact that the space available in the tank to store surface water runoff at any
particular time is entirely dependent on the balance between the demand and supply, and the water level is not
“managed” in an “active” way.
Where RWH systems are implemented for individual residential properties, surface water control for the design
rainfall event is unlikely to be achieved for every property, and an average level of compliance will need to be
assumed. Where groups of properties share a tank, or where consistent demand in commercial buildings is more
likely, performance of the system is more certain.
RWH for water conservation (supply) and surface water management, active systems
If the water storage in a tank is actively managed, then all properties can be designed to comply with surface water
management objectives, irrespective of the relative levels of demand and supply, provided the system is managed
so that no runoff (of any significance) occurs for any event up to the design rainfall depth. There are two mechanisms
available to ensure that sufficient tank volume is available to manage the design storm depth. These are
forecasting that a large event is approaching (days or hours ahead) and pumping the stored water away, or
pumping out the stored water down to a set level whenever a threshold is exceeded.
The first option requires communication to rainfall event forecasting information. The second requires a timer delay
so that water is pumped away at a set time after the event has passed.
Rainwater harvesting for schools, Essex
At Columbus School and College in
Chelmsford, rainwater is harvested
from both sites in a combined
storage and treatment facility. The
water is then distributed for use in
the toilets.
RWH forms part of a wider water
management strategy, which also
includes SuDS to manage local
flooding, water-efficient fittings and
fixtures plus leak detection systems
and drought resistant planting.
The scheme forms part of a wider
strategy by Essex County Council
to improve sustainability standards
and reduce costs.

Several other schools in the county also use RWH. Monitoring of different systems is helping to
inform future schemes.

11.1.1 Gravity systems
Gravity systems are designed so that the rainwater is collected by gravity and stored at elevation so that it
can also be supplied by gravity (Figure 11.3).
Rainfall runoff can be collected from standard domestic or commercial property pitched roofs and stored
in the roof space or on the roof. In other designs, the storage is supported at a high level on the wall just
below gutter level. In low elevation buildings, above-ground storage tanks can be used to serve ground
floor appliances and irrigation demands.
The key design constraints are
the structural capacity of the building to store the water at an elevated location
the collection of sufficient water from the roof, at sufficient height, that will allow subsequent supply
based on a gravity-only process
limiting operating pressure
temperature of stored water.
Modern domestic properties are generally quite lightweight structures and only designed to meet
standard loadings, which includes the storage of cold water tanks in lofts. The roof area of a standard
pitched roof tends to fall to a level equal to or below the loft space, therefore collecting water by gravity
and storing it in the loft has to limit the collection area to the upper section of the roof unless below-gutter
storage options are used (where they can be supported structurally).
Figure 11. A conceptual gravity-fed RWH system
11.1.2 Pumped systems
The most common type of RWH systems tend to store water underground or at ground level and then
pump it out for supply purposes.
There are two types of pumped systems those that pump to a header tank and those that pump directly
to the units in the buildings.
210 Part D: Technical detail
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
A typical pumped RWH system is shown in Figure 11.4.
Figure 11. A conceptual pumped rainwater harvesting system
11.1.3 Composite systems
These systems use the advantages of both gravity and pumped processes. Runoff collected by gravity
is passed directly to a large header tank, while excess runoff (and runoff from areas that cannot drain by
gravity to the header tank) can be stored in the main tank in the ground. If and when the header tank is
empty, a pump then comes into operation to fill it from the main storage tank. Although the header tank is
likely to be much smaller than the main tank, the amount of water which needs to be pumped is often very
significantly reduced compared to a fully pumped system.
11.2 SELECTION AND SITING OF RWH SYSTEMS
Rainwater harvesting can be used in residential, commercial or industrial development for new or retrofit
projects for water conservation and surface water management. Careful consideration should be given
to the likely contaminants present in the runoff, and thus the suitability of the runoff for harvesting for
example, runoff from roofing materials containing copper or inc, or treated with fungicides or herbicides,
may not be suitable, depending on the purpose for which the water is to be used.
There are a number of site-specific features that will influence how RWH systems are designed (in addition
to the considerations of contributing area, property demand and elevation discussed in Section 11.1).
Chapter 11: Rainwater harvesting
211
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Selection and siting of RWH systems will depend on the sie and access requirements of the tank and
the physical constraints of the site. In all cases, easy but safe access is needed to all components (filters,
pumps etc) to ensure that there is no impediment to maintenance being carried out.
Storage tanks should be placed in a safe, secure location either underground, indoors, on roofs or
adjacent to buildings (depending on the intended uses of the water). Tanks that are located underground
tend to have improved performance with respect to the control of water temperature, reducing bacterial
growth in summer and frost damage in winter. Where the tank has to be installed close to the building,
structural considerations such as the depth of the foundations and the watertightness of the RWH unit
and its overflow provision are particularly important. The presence of underground utilities may also
constrain the location of the tank.
Tanks should not generally be placed on filled ground, and an adequate geotechnical investigation should
be undertaken to ensure the suitability of the soils for the tank foundation.
The storage tank is quite likely to be empty for periods of time and, where groundwater levels are close to
the ground surface, the issue of flotation will need to be addressed.
11.3 HYDRAULIC DESIGN
11.3.1 General
The siing of an RWH storage tank is a function of
the demand for non-potable water from the tank
the regularity of the demand
the area contributing runoff to the tank
the local seasonal rainfall characteristics
the design level of service for the tank, with respect to the control of surface water.
An accurate assessment of the performance of an RWH system requires the pattern of demand to
be modelled, together with a continuous rainfall time series and runoff model. This enables temporal
patterns of supply, storage and demand to be predicted, together with frequencies of overflow operation
and supply shortfall. However, in most instances, this approach is not needed and a simplified calculation
of tank storage can be used.
The RWH code of practice BS 5152009A1201 provides six ways of calculating tank sies. These are
1 the simple method for water conservation
2 the intermediate method for water conservation
the simple surface water management method with passive control
the intermediate surface water management method with passive control
5 the detailed surface water management method with passive control
6 the surface water management method with active control.
Each of these methods are discussed in the following sections. It should be noted that the surface water
management options automatically provide an equivalent (or better) level of service with respect to
water conservation (supply). An automated calculation of storage tank sie for residential RWHs can be
accessed from www.uksuds.com
In all cases, there is an assumption that regular daily demand will take place. If there are unusual demand
requirements, then analysis from first principles will be needed. This applies to all uses of RWH systems
whether residential, commercial, industrial or institutional.
212 Part D: Technical detail
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
The primary parameters used for calculating the size of the storage are:
the storm rainfall depth that is to be captured
average annual rainfall (AAR)
daily demand for non-potable water
building occupancy
contributing surface area.
These are described in the following subsections. Other parameters include the runoff factor and the filter
efficiency factor.
Design level of service for the tank (design rainfall depth)
The design rainfall depth can be any value. However, site runoff volumetric control criteria are often linked
to the 1 in 100 year, 6-hour event, which tends to be of the order of 60 mm in the UK (Figure 11.5).
Average annual rainfall for the UK
The average annual rainfall across the UK can be obtained by reference to tools such as the Flood
Estimation Handbook (FEH) CEH, 1999) or the mapping from the older Flood Studies Report (FSR) (IOH,
1975). Figure 11.6 provides an indication of the annual rainfall depths across the UK.
Daily demand for non-potable water
The assumed consumption of non-potable water has historically been 50 litre/capita/day (l/c/d) for toilet
flushing (assuming 9 litre cisterns). However, with recent developments in water-efficient appliance design
(eg maximum toilet cistern sie of 6 litres), daily household toilet usage is now thought to be closer to 20 l/c/d
(Kellagher, 2012). The consumption of water in washing machines is believed to be of the same order at
around 20 l/c/d. This means that 0 l/c/d could be assumed if both appliances use non-potable water.
These figures have been based on research (Kellagher, 2012), but there is some degree of uncertainty
over whether these figures are suitable averages to use, and as variations in water use are likely to be
significant between households, it is important to assume a conservative (low) value when designing for
surface water runoff management.
For commercial properties such as offices where toilet flushing alone is used during the working day, the
consumption rate may be as low as 10 l/c/d. Guidance on water consumption for any category of building
should be obtained when designing for non-potable water use (BS 522011). For other buildings where
water demand is driven by temporary customer use (eg schools, large stores, supermarkets) consumption
needs to be based on specific information associated with the buildings being served.
Occupancy rates of domestic properties
The occupancy rates of properties are available from statistical information gathered by the government
and regional authorities. These are linked to type of property which includes the number of bedrooms.
The average occupancy values are supported with information on standard deviation, which is important
when assessing the degree of compliance of individual property RWH systems in managing runoff from a
specific design storm depth.
An illustration of values for household occupancy is provided in Table 11.2 and these are fairly
representative of many other regions of the UK.

For water conservation design, a traditional rule of thumb is two persons per bedroom, although the
figures in Table 11.3 indicate that this may be conservative, and perhaps the mean occupancy plus one
standard deviation (if this is known) is a more reasonable estimate to use.
For surface water management design, the mean occupancy should be used, which is conservative for
this aspect of the design.
Contributing plan areas
Contributing roof areas should be calculated in plan. It is important to use the actual roof plan area
drained as it may not be possible to capture all the runoff from a roof area due to the various pitch
arrangements of the property.
unoff ied oeffiients
It is important to recognise that many events are relatively small and therefore the initial wetting losses,
especially for flat roofed areas, may be quite significant which can mean that the overall proportion of
runoff for an event is much less than 100. Where losses are complex and varied, such as on green
roofs and permeable pavements, then analysis with a continuous rainfall time series, taking into account
evapotranspiration may be necessary to get a sufficiently accurate estimate of the likely proportion of
runoff. Table 11.4 provides suggested values for the average runoff coefficient.

The runoff coefficients suggested for green roofs and permeable pavements in particular are likely to be
higher than would be observed for most small-to-medium events (ie they will give too high an estimate of
yield and associated yield/demand ratio).
An alternative approach to the calculation of the runoff yield can be used which explicitly addresses both
the losses for each event and the runoff coefficient losses once the collection surface is wet. Table 11.5
provides indicative values for various roof surfaces for this approach.

Note

Intensive and extensive green roofs are described in Chapter 12.
For small roofs, it is unlikely that green roofing would be used together with RWH as the natural losses
from green roofs are large and demand would be significantly greater than the available supply. However,
for very large roofs (or where demand is limited) there may be a need to use both in conjunction in order
to adequately meet surface water volume control requirements.
draui fiter effiien
Runoff losses are increased by filter losses. Filters vary in the way they work, and these losses are also
a function of the rainfall depths and intensities. It is best to use an appropriate coefficient for the actual
filter used in the design (obtained from the manufacturer), but a coefficient of 90 can be adopted as a
starting point.

21 Part D: Technical detail
Siin W storae tans for ater onseration su on S
The siing of storage tanks for water conservation (supply) systems is generally based on a value that
is the smaller of either 5 of the annual property water demand or 5 of the annual runoff yield of the
contributing surface. The approach remains the same for one or more than one property and assumes
reliable regular daily demand for the water, and
fairly similar monthly rainfall depths throughout the year.
The 5 figure is based on the presumption that 5 of the year (ie 1 days) provides enough time for the
rainfall yield to approximate to the average yield.
Where the RWH system does not have a regular demand, and/or where a large amount of water might be
needed infrequently (eg a garden centre), then the design will need to take account of the seasonality of
both supply and demand patterns.
The simple method is just a graphical representation of the formula-based intermediate method (see
below). This allows the capacity of the storage tank to be determined based on an assumed number of
occupants (in this case, four people), the annual rainfall depth and the sie of the roof of the property
(plan area). Figure 11.7 illustrates the approach, drawn from BS 5152009A1201. A roof runoff
coefficient of 0, a water demand per person of 50 l/c/d and 1 days of storage have been assumed in
To avoid having a separate figure for different occupancy rates, the information can be aggregated to
one figure, as illustrated in Figure 11.8. The horiontal lines for each property occupancy defines the
maximum storage that is appropriate for that property, due to the limit in the demand.

The intermediate method
The intermediate method is based on calculating the lesser of 5 of the annual runoff yield and 5
of the annual property demand as set out in the following sections. The 5 represents approximately
1 days of supply/demand and is required to ensure that sufficient storage is available, being suitably
conservative so as to take account of the variability in rainfall/demand patterns.

11.3.3 Sizing RWH storage tanks for surface water management, with passive control
All surface water management methods are based on two criteria
1 A design rainfall depth is to be captured by the system without the overflow coming into operation.
2 The average annual demand (DN) is greater than the average annual yield (YR) from the contributing area.
Where seasonal variability is significant, data should be used for the season for which large rainfall event
control is relevant.
The demand assessment is based on assumed occupancy and water usage. As a result of the passive
control approach and the variability in property occupancy (and therefore consumption), surface water
control for the design event is unlikely to be achieved for every property. Where demand is lower than
average, the RWH tank will tend to have lower availability for the storage of runoff. A rule of thumb should
therefore be adopted that assumes that 0 of properties on any site will fail to control surface water
runoff for the design event.
The water demand for a group of properties sharing a communal RWH tank is more predictable as the
total population for a group of houses will tend to converge toward the average. Therefore the more
properties there are sharing a tank, the less likely the tank is to fail to deliver surface water management
for the design rainfall depth. Demand predictability is also likely to be higher for commercial properties.
There are design uncertainties regarding how many houses are needed to achieve sufficient convergence
on the mean water consumption, and what the chance of “failure” is for the system with respect to
managing the design event. These questions can be addressed using appropriate statistical analysis.
However, as the consequences of failure of a communal system is greater (if it is being presumed that
the runoff volume is being stored), a degree of conservatism needs to be exercised in the analysis of
assessing the yield and demand ratio. As the number of properties served by a communal rainwater
system increases, the uncertainty associated with the demand level reduces and the likelihood that YR/DN
is greater than 0.9 is lowered.
The simple method
For the simple method, the YR/DN ratio should be less than 0.7. This method calculates the water
conservation (supply) component and the surface water management storage volumes separately and
simply adds them together. However, for the situation where the demand (DN) is more than three times the
yield (YR) (ie where YR/DN 0.), the total storage that needs to be provided can be limited to the storage
required for surface water management alone.
The storage calculation is set out in Box 11.4.

specific.

Figure 11.9 Additional storage volume VSC required for surface water management, over and above the storage
needed for water conservation, simple approach
The intermediate method
The intermediate method is effectively a minor refinement of the simple method. The extra assumption is that,
where YR/DN ranges between 0. and 0.7, the storage provision for water conservation can be reduced to
minimise the increase in volume needed for surface water management. In all other aspects the constraints
and design criteria are the same as those given for the simple method for surface water management.
The detailed method
This method can be used for all scenarios where YR/DN 0.9. In this scenario, storage volumes
calculated using the simple or intermediate methods will underestimate the storage requirements.
This methodology is based on the research work of Gerolin and Kellagher undertaken to avoid the need
to carry out extensive analysis using a continuous rainfall time series (Kellagher, 2012). This method does
not guarantee to capture the design rainfall depth for all events, but is aimed at achieving this objective for
at least 90 of all such events.

Ad (allowance depth)
As SP50 is the available storage available in the tank for 50 of the time, an extra allowance of
storage is needed to ensure capture of 90 of all storms equal to or greater than the design rainfall
depth. This extra allowance depth (Ad), measured in terms of rainfall depth, is defined as

and 0 mm.

The CP50 value takes into account the fact that the effective storage volume provided is less than

storing the runoff. The value of CP50 is:

Note: the difference in the values CP50 values are small, and this hydrological regional refinement
only has a small influence on the design tank storage volume.
11.3.4 The detailed surface water management method – with active control
Most RWH systems are designed as passive systems, and the demand for active RWH systems is
currently limited. However, as the advantages they bring becomes better understood, especially in
situations where site management criteria focus on runoff volume control, it is likely that actively managed
RWH systems will become more commonplace. There are three benefits of using actively managed
systems over their passive counterparts. These are:
storage volumes can be reduced when the YR/DN ratio is 0.7
they can be used where YR/DN is 1.0
the assumption of non-compliance of 0 of all residential properties is no longer needed where
RWH systems are used for individual dwellings.
The method works on the basis that active control of the available storage volume in the tank ensures
that the capture of the design event rainfall runoff can be guaranteed. The active management requires
the tank to be drawn down every time the water level encroaches above the volume needed to store
the design rainfall depth. However, this action cannot be taken as soon as this threshold is triggered, as
this may mean that the system is discharging rather than storing the design rainfall during a flood event.
Therefore discharge can only take place when its effect will not cause negative impacts on flood risk for
downstream areas and drainage systems. For many site drainage systems, the critical duration of the
storage system is more than a day, in which case the drawdown should be delayed for at least two days
in order to minimise the effects of many such systems drawing down following an event. The longer the
period before drawdown, the greater is the statistical risk of the design rainfall depth being only partially
captured or not being captured at all. However, the probabilities associated with this are very small and
the consequences in larger catchments are also small. Only where YR/DN ratios are significantly higher
than 1.0 is this issue worth examining in more detail.
22 Part D: Technical detail
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Although this method is not dependent on the ratio of
yield to demand, it is worth noting that where YR/DN
1.0 the emptying frequency will be relatively small,
while if it is above this threshold then pump drawdown
will occur fairly often. Pump drawdown will be more
frequent as the ratio increases. This factor could
influence the design of the trigger thresholds and the
on and off pump settings.
In cases where YR/DN 1.0, the drawdown depth
might be set to the equivalent to 5 mm of rainfall
(Figure 11.10). However, where YR/DN 1.0 the
drawdown might be increased to 10 mm of rainfall to
minimise the frequency of pumping, and also to ensure
there is a little more time during which the available
storage exceeds the design rainfall depth requirement.
It should be noted that when YR/DN 1.0, the tank
will be very rarely empty and therefore the extra
drawdown will not significantly impact on the water
available for use.
Figure 11.10 Rainwater harvesting tanks with active
control for surface water management
Where RWH systems are designed to manage surface water runoff, they can contribute to all aspects of
site drainage. For the surfaces served, they can meet the Interception criterion, contribute significantly
to the volume reduction needed to meet the volumetric criterion and reduce the volume of temporary
storage required to attenuate flows discharged from the site.
nteretion desin
RWH, whether designed for water conservation only or surface water management as well, provides
benefits in delivering Interception for all connected surfaces where demand from the system is regular
and consistent through the year.
Where YR/DN is significantly more than a ratio of 1.0 (and the system is not actively managed), then it will
be ineffective for surface water management, but it can still be considered to provide Interception as it will
prevent the first 5 mm of most rainfall events from creating runoff.
Designing for Interception is discussed in Section 24.8.
ea o ontro desin
RWH systems will only contribute to peak flow rate reductions during the period where upstream storage
tanks are filling, that is when there is no runoff from the contributing surfaces. Once the tank storage is
full, there will be no reduction in flow rates as it should be assumed that runoff then passes to the site
drainage system. Unless the RWH system can be designed to guarantee to capture all events without
overflowing (which is very unlikely), RWH systems cannot be assumed to contribute to a reduction in
peak flow rate on a consistent basis, and therefore site conveyance design should not assume that any
flow rate reduction is achieved. If RWH is a major site component in managing runoff, and it is felt that
there are significant gains to be made in reducing the site conveyance capacity, then a detailed analysis
of a continuous rainfall time series of 100200 years would need to be carried out to justify the design of
the site drainage where conveyance rates are reduced.

RWH systems can be designed to capture and retain the design rainfall event depth required for
volumetric control (as set out in Sections 11.3.3 and 11.3.4).
Chapter 11: Rainwater harvesting

CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
The surface water management storage volume provided by the RWH systems will contribute to reducing
the volume of attenuation storage required on the site. The critical duration of the design event for the site
attenuation storage will be shortened due to the reduction in runoff volume delivered by the RWH system.
The attenuation storage volume will be reduced by more than the amount of the RWH storage provided.
Designing for attenuation storage is discussed in Section 24.9.
eedane o desin
RWH systems for surface water management are designed to capture a specific depth of rainfall. They
therefore only contribute to extreme event flow management during the initial stages of extended extreme
events and during high intensity, short duration rainfall when site drainage systems are overwhelmed
while the rainwater tanks are still capturing and storing runoff.
Consideration should be given to the design of the RWH overflow and the subsequent discharge pathway.
Where infiltration systems are used for disposal of excess water, then consideration should be given to
the likely frequency and consequences of potential exceedance events.
11.4 TREATMENT DESIGN
There are two aspects with regards to RWH system treatment design
1 the contribution of RWH systems to the control of pollution from site surface water runoff
2 the treatment of the collected rainwater so that it is suitable for non-potable domestic or other uses
11.4.1 RWH contribution to site runoff pollution control
Roof runoff is significantly less polluted than runoff from road surfaces. Nevertheless, roofs may still
generate pollutants such as sediments, PAHs and metals due to atmospheric deposition and runoff
entrainment. In some cases, particularly in commercial environments, the wash-off of roofing constituents
such as copper and inc is a particular issue. Where roof runoff is captured by the RWH system, any
pollutants from the roof surface will be captured by the collection and filtration system. Maintenance of
the system is essential to prevent debris, sediment and other pollutants that accumulate in the filters from
being discharged downstream, and to ensure the long-term performance of the system.
By reducing the volume of runoff generated from the site, particularly for small events, RWH systems can
directly reduce the pollutant load discharged to receiving waters. They are considered as an effective
Interception component for the roof contributing to the system whether designed for surface water
management or water conservation (supply) only.
11.4.2 Treatment of collected runoff for use
RWH systems designed to BS 5152009A1201 should deliver a water quality that is suitable for
applications such as toilet flushing, washing machines and garden watering. Runoff that contains a high
pollutant loading (eg sediments or heavy metals) may only be appropriate for use after treatment. The use
of the harvested runoff will dictate the extent and type of treatment that should be provided. Disinfection
may be required where site-specific risk assessment indicates the need for a specific water quality.
Useful references on this topic include BS 5152009A1201, BS 595201 and a number of papers
particularly those from Fewtrell and Kay (2007a, 2007b).
Rainwater harvesting water quality treatment measures include pre-treatment, filtration, biological
treatment and disinfection. Storing the water below ground can reduce the need for water quality
treatment by keeping the water cool. Cool water has higher oxygen concentrations and prevents bacteria
growth, and the lack of light prevents algal growth. Filters can be implemented pre or post storage.
Treatment technology is developing rapidly as RWH system uptake and development increases, and is
not covered further here.

RWH systems provide indirect amenity value by supporting the resilience of developments and their
landscape to changes in climate and water resource availability. Occasionally, they can also provide
direct amenity value when implemented above ground, if designed with visual interest and/or integrated
with landscape features and/or combined with educational initiatives. RWH systems can be made visually
attractive, with considered engineering and landscape design input.
11.6 BIODIVERSITY DESIGN
RWH tanks do not have any inherent biodiversity value, but they can help to reduce flows on the
downstream system, and this can help facilitate biodiversity delivery in those areas.
11.7 PHYSICAL SPECIFICATIONS
11.7.1 Pre-treatment and inlets
Primary screening devices are used to prevent leaves and other debris from entering the tank. Primary
screening devices often have a wire mesh screen installed near the downspout. If leaves pose a problem,
a leaf screen should be installed along the entire gutter length.
First flush devices can be designed to divert the first part of the rainfall away from the main storage tank.
The first flush picks up most of the dirt, debris, and contaminants (eg bird droppings) that collect on the roof.
Consideration will then be required as to where this first flush is safely treated and managed downstream.
11.7.2 Underdrains and outlets
RWH systems need either an inlet valve that closes flow into the container when it is full, or an overflow
arrangement that conveys excess surface water runoff away from the building without causing damage.
Erosion protection measures for the overflow should be provided as necessary.
S
ainater harestin tan strutures
Most rainwater collection tanks are manufactured from plastics, concrete or steel. When selecting a
material and product type, consideration should be given to
the potential need for protection of the tank materials against the corrosive effects of the stored
water and any disinfectants used
the tank service life
resistance to flotation and potential restraint options
structural design and installation complexity
ease of maintenance if the system blocks or becomes contaminated in some way
aesthetics (where the tank is visually accessible).
The storage of rainwater does not have to be in a traditional tank the void space in sub-base material of
a permeable paving system or within geocellular modular units, encapsulated within a robust, weldable,
geomembrane can also be used.
Geotextile and geomembrane specifications are presented in Chapter 30.

Tanks should be designed to prevent freeing during winter, and ingress of groundwater. Underground
tanks should be properly designed and installed to withstand groundwater, earth and/or backfill
pressures, surcharge loads, vehicular loading and flotation.
oetion and distribution sstems
External pipework needs to designed to prevent freeing during winter.
Internal pipework needs to be distinguished from potable water pipework by using pipe materials which
comply with the RWH code of practice BS 5152009A1201.
11.9 LANDSCAPE DESIGN AND PLANTING
There are no landscape design aspects to the use of RWH systems unless the water is stored in a
landscape feature.
RWH systems can be used to provide a supply of water for plant irrigation.
11.10 CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS
RWH systems should be installed using safe construction methods, and manufacturers’ guidelines should
be followed in all cases.
Care should be taken to avoid cross-connections, and pipe marking is essential. Reference should be made
to the Water Supply (Water Fittings) Regulations 1999. Guidelines are available in BS 5152009A1201
on pipe markings, fittings and other construction guidance. Any buried
tank should be designed by a structural engineer to ensure that it is
suitable for the ground conditions in which it is installed.
Modern developments often have quite small gardens and RWH tanks
are often located close to a building. Careful consideration of the
structural impact on the building of the excavation and subsequent
operation of the system needs to be taken. Consideration should also
be given to requirements for structural support (eg using appropriate
concrete backfill around the unit). Flotation risk during periods of
extended wet weather should also be checked.
The operation of the tank overflow when the system is full (including
the frequency, volume and impact of spills) needs to be considered
and designed to avoid damage or nuisance.
Surface water should not be diverted to the RWH system until the
catchment area and overflow area have been stabilised.

More detail on construction activities and the programming of construction activities is provided in
Chapter 32.
Generic health and safety considerations are discussed in Chapter 36.
11.11 OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS
Any property with an RWH system installed should be provided with appropriate information as to what
equipment has been installed, its purpose, its operation and maintenance requirements, the actions
needed to address any potential failure and the expected performance of the system. Information on the
options for external maintenance support should also be provided.
22 Part D: Technical detail
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Most systems require periodic checking and maintenance to ensure trouble-free and reliable
operation. There are wide differences in the extent of maintenance required for different systems, and
manufacturers’ guidelines should always be followed. Table 11.6 provides guidance on the type of
operational and maintenance requirements that may be appropriate. The list of actions is not exhaustive
and some actions may not always be required.
Maintenance requirements are largely dependent on the runoff source and the runoff use (and thus
treatment processes provided). This will range from weekly input through to rare intervention. Routine
inspection of the filter system at quarterly annual intervals is advised, even if they do not appear to need
specific intervention. Pumps need very little attention, but their design life is generally regarded as only
being 10 years. Where automatic provision of potable water occurs (if and when rainwater is either not
available or the system has failed), it is useful to have sensor warnings relayed in such a manner as to
inform the user of the current status of the system.
RWH systems should be designed so that when there is an absence of rain, or a need to
disconnect the system for maintenance or repair, that potable water is safely available for all
appliances to avoid inconvenience.
Tanks should be accessible for internal inspection, and the cover should preferably be lockable. For more
guidance on operation and maintenance of RWH systems, see BS 5152009A1201.
The maintenance responsibility for an RWH system is usually with the owner of the property, but any
communal systems require the participating community to be informed of the system, as detailed, but also
be provided with information of who the organisation is that is maintaining the system and any financial
commitments and any legally binding maintenance agreement.

12Chapter Green roofs
This chapter provides guidance on the design of green roofs – that
is, roofs with a vegetated surface that provide a degree of retention,
attenuation and treatment of rainwater and promote evapotranspiration.
12.1 GENERAL DESCRIPTION
Green roofs are areas of living vegetation, installed on the top of buildings, for a range of
reasons including visual benefit, ecological value, enhanced building performance and the
reduction of surface water runoff. Types of green roof can be divided into two main categories:
Extensive roofs, have low substrate depths (and therefore low loadings on the
building structure), simple planting and low maintenance requirements; they tend
not to be accessible.
Intensive roofs (or roof gardens) have deeper substrates (and therefore higher
loadings on the building structure) that can support a wide variety of planting but
which tend to require more intensive maintenance; they are usually accessible.
A blue roof is a roof design that is explicitly intended to store water. This storage can
be designed as attenuation storage (with water released in a controlled manner), as
storage for use such as irrigation (potentially of adjacent green roof areas), cooling
water (for use in reducing the temperature of the roof on hot days, or for internal cooling
plant) or non-potable use within the building, and/or for recreational opportunities. Blue
roofs can include open water surfaces, storage within or beneath a porous medium
or modular surfaces, or below a raised decking surface or impermeable cover. Green
roofs that include reservoir storage zones beneath the growing medium could also be
termed “blue roofs”. Blue roofs are not considered in detail in this chapter as they are,
essentially, equivalent to other components described in this manual. The key design
considerations are the structural capacity of the roof to deal with the extra loadings and
the waterproofing required to protect the building.
Although green roofs are generally more expensive than conventional roofs to construct
and maintain, they can provide many long-term benefits. The vegetated cover assembly
should be compatible with and designed to protect the underlying roof waterproofing
materials. The design life of the roof waterproofing can be extended by protecting the
waterproofing from mechanical damage, shielding it from ultraviolet radiation, and
buffering temperature extremes.
Green roofs can improve the thermal performance of buildings, potentially reducing building
energy costs, due to the plants and substrate cooling the roof through evapotranspiration
during summer months. Winter insulation properties are dependent on the amount of water
held by the roof, and in wet winters such as in the UK, gains will tend to be low. Green roofs
will help combat the urban heat island effect where there is a sufficient number in an urban
area, as well as contributing to improved air quality by capturing dust particles.
Detailed UK guidance for green roofs is provided in Early et al (2007), The
Greenroof Centre (2011) and GRO (2014).
A green roof consists of a system in which several materials are layered to achieve
the desired vegetative cover and drainage characteristics. Design components vary
depending on the green roof type and site constraints, but typically include the elements
shown in Figure 12.1.
Chapter 12: Green roofs
233
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Figure 12.1 Section showing typical extensive green roof components
As mentioned earlier, there are two main types of green roof:
Extensive green roofs – These systems cover the entire roof area with hardy, slow growing, drought
tolerant, low maintenance plants (eg mosses, succulents, herbs, grasses) often enhanced with
wildflowers. Planting often establishes more slowly, but the long-term biodiversity can be of high value.
They are only accessed for maintenance and can be flat or sloping. Extensive green roofs typically
comprise a 20150 mm thick growing medium and can be further divided into single-layer systems
(which consist of a single medium designed to be free-draining and support plant growth), and “multi-
layer” systems that include both a growing medium layer and a separate underlying drainage layer. They
are lightweight and low cost to maintain, and can be used in a wide variety of locations with minimal
intervention. They are often suitable for retrofit on existing structures due to their light weight. Biodiverse
extensive green roofs are often planted with a mix of species supported by a range of soil depths.
Intensive green roofs (or roof gardens) – These are designed to sustain more complex landscaped
environments that can provide high amenity or biodiversity benefits. They are planted with a range of
plants including grasses, shrubs and/or trees, either as ground cover or within planters, and may also
include water features and storage of rainwater for irrigation (ie blue roof elements). They are usually
easily accessible, as they normally require a fairly high level of regular maintenance, and in some cases
they are made accessible to the public. Intensive roofs have a deeper substrate, with 150 mm growing
medium, and therefore impose greater loads on the roof structure.
Green roofs with substrate depths of 100–200 mm tend to be semi-intensive roofs, and can include
characteristics of both extensive and intensive roofs, with plants that include shrubs and woody plants.
Irrigation and maintenance requirements of this type of roof will be dependent upon the plant species chosen
for the roof. There are also various combinations of green roof that combine both types in a single roof system.
A comparison of the main differences between extensive and intensive green roof systems is given in
Table 12.1.

12.2 GENERAL DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS
The successful design of a green roof will require collaboration between structural engineers (with
particular respect to the structural capacity of the building to withstand the imposed loads), architects,
landscape architects, ecologists, horticulturists and drainage engineers. It also requires consideration of
the maintenance that will be required. Access to undertake the construction and maintenance easily and
safely should be a high priority in designing the roof.
Health and safety risk management design is discussed in Chapter 36.
Important design considerations include:
accessibility requirements
biodiversity objectives
amenity/aesthetic objectives and desired visual impact
the saturated weight of the system and the load-bearing capacity of the underlying roof deck and structure
other imposed loads, including maintenance loadings and snow cover
the need for integration of rooftop equipment, such as vents, air-conditioning systems, solar panels
and/or RWH systems

the root penetration resistance of the waterproof membrane or dedicated root protection layer
resistance to wind shear and negative (uplift) wind pressures
management of drainage
growing medium
suitability of plants
maintenance management skills, equipment and time input.
12.3 SELECTION AND SITING OF GREEN ROOFS
Green roofs can be used on a variety of roof types and on any property size. They can be applied to a
range of rooftop slopes, but steeper pitches will normally mean that less storage capacity is available, and
the water drains away faster, unless the
underlying drainage layer is specifically
designed to capture and control flows.
The greater the volume of water stored,
the greater the potential loadings on the
building – which may be an important
design consideration.
The environmental parameters at the
location where a green roof is to be
installed have to be considered in
the design process. The height of the
roof, its exposure to wind, the roof’s
orientation to the sun and shading by
surrounding buildings during parts of the
day will have an impact on the choice
and suitability of planting. The general
climate of the area and the specific
Figure 12.5 Domestic green roofing, Swansea (courtesy Sky Garden)
microclimate on the roof should also
be considered. Views to and from the roof may also determine where certain elements are located for
maximum effect (Section 12.6). Ecological considerations include the bioregion in which the roof lies, the
existing habitats (including any green infrastructure or other ecological networks) and the objectives of
any local biodiversity strategies. Planning objectives may also be relevant (Chapter 7).
Green roofs can be easily retrofitted providing there is sufficient structural capacity in the roof to support
them, and provided that suitable and robust waterproofing can be installed. With careful choice of
materials, lightweight systems can be designed to suit most buildings.
Many new buildings will be able to accommodate green roofs with little or no increased strengthening
because of the current requirement to provide thermal mass, in order to comply with Part L of the
Building Regulations. Even on single ply roof waterproofing systems where ballast is not normally
required, the increase in load from a green roof is unlikely to exceed 20%. Because of structural and
other requirements in British standards and codes of practice, it is possible that an increase in load of this
magnitude could be accommodated without increasing the structural capacity of the roof.
Lightweight industrial buildings may not have sufficient structural capacity to support a green roof,
and this can lead to increased costs where the building has to be reinforced. However, the cost of the
green roof and extra structural provision can be offset against long-term savings in the requirements for
surface water attenuation storage at ground or below-ground level (The Greenroof Centre, 2011) and the
improved thermal performance of the building.
Green roofs can be used together with RWH systems, although the yield from the roof will be significantly
lower than for conventional roofing materials (Chapter 11).

12.4 HYDRAULIC DESIGN
12.4.1 General
Although green roofs absorb most of the rainfall that they receive during frequent events, there will always
be a need to discharge excess water to the building’s drainage system. The hydraulic performance of
green roofs once saturated tends to be fairly similar to standard roofs. Therefore, the hydraulic design of
green roof drainage should follow the advice in BS EN 12056-2000. Useful information is also provided
in BS 6229:2003. Detailed guidelines for the planning, execution and upkeep of green roof sites are
contained within GRO (2014).
Green roofs act a little like ordinary pervious surfaces, particularly intensive roofs with significant depths
of substrate. However, this similarity reduces for roofs with shallower substrate and steeper gradients,
which only tend to attenuate runoff during small or initial stages of an event.
Hydraulic design for green roofs should consider two aspects of their performance:
how the roof is likely to behave during an extreme storm (and its potential contribution to meeting the
hydraulic standard of service for the whole site drainage system), which is likely to be limited
how the roof is likely to perform through the year, with a focus on the reduction of runoff volume for
the majority of rainfall events (ie Interception).
12.4.2 Interception design
The performance of green roofs in terms of reducing or preventing the runoff from normal rainfall events
is usually very significant in the summer due to the evapotranspiration processes and temporary storage
provided by the roof.
All green roofs can be assumed to meet Interception requirements in the summer, based on their
retention of 5 mm of rainfall. However, roofs are likely to struggle to meet Interception requirements
during cold, wet winter periods when they are likely to be saturated for much of the time. The amount of
rainfall that can be absorbed by a green roof before runoff takes place is very dependent on antecedent
conditions. Thus, any assumptions regarding green roof performance during design storms should take
a conservative position and consider whether the event is in summer or winter. Only an extended time
series analysis will result in a reasonably accurate assessment of its likely performance. Any model
should reflect the characteristics of the proposed green roof, and this might require calibration against
observed data, as there are currently no modelling tools available which specifically represent green roof
runoff. Evidence of green roof performance in reducing runoff from rainfall events is set out in Box 12.1.
It is uncommon to link a green roof to an RWH system, but in some circumstances this may be very
beneficial (eg if the volume of runoff from the site has to be minimised and the demand for non-potable
water is limited compared to the roof area). The colour of water collected from a green roof may preclude
its internal use within the building, but it will be more suitable for irrigation.
For guidance on RWH system design, see Chapter 11.

Note

Martin (2008) reported that the reduction in depth and frequency of runoff from a green roof with 100 mm
of substrate is similar to that of a naturally vegetated catchment. For the majority (70–80%) of rain events
there is no runoff from green roofs (Figure 12.6) but for about 10 out of approximately 100 rain days a
year green roofs have a response that is more similar to an impermeable surface (demonstrating the shift
towards impermeable runoff characteristics when the substrate is saturated).

Green roofs can provide benefits in terms of reducing peak flow rates to the site drainage system
principally for small and medium-sied events. Their impact tends to be most significant in summer,
where intense short duration events may generate very little runoff from the roof.
The reduction in the volume of runoff from a green roof for an extreme event is unlikely to impact on
downstream attenuation storage requirements. Critical duration events for developments served by
SuDS are commonly of the order of 12 to 36 hours, which tend to be representative of autumn and winter
conditions, when reductions in runoff volumes from green roofs are likely to be small.
The depth of rainfall that will be stored in any rainfall event is a function of the antecedent soil moisture,
the soil depth, the roof gradient and any specific storage provision designed within the drainage layer.
The proportion of runoff from a green roof will increase as the duration and depth of the storm increases
and the attenuation effects provided by the roof will reduce.
Where the design of the downstream drainage system (eg attenuation storage volumes and conveyance
capacities) is linked to the green roof performance, then the benefits should be explicitly determined using
modelling or evidence-based information. Attenuation can only be guaranteed if it is specifically included
within the design as part of the drainage layer (and with the potential use of throttled outlets).
The storage characteristics of blue roofs will only be a function of the hydraulic controls at the outlet of
the system. Although they can be designed to attenuate flows, any volumetric reduction will be limited
to evaporation. The performance of a blue roof is more predictable than a green roof, as it usually
constitutes a standard arrangement of attenuation storage and throttled outlets.
12.4.4 Volume control design
There is a growing body of evidence that green roofs considerably reduce the volume of runoff in warmer
periods when the soil moisture deficit is high. The type of plants used and soil depths will influence
evapotranspiration rates and available potential storage in the soil. Sedum roofs, due to the nature of the
plants, tend to conserve water and have lower evapotranspiration rates during hot dry conditions (Stovin
et al, 2012). The rate of evapotranspiration also depends on the volume of water stored (ie available)
on the roof. If detailed modelling of roofs is carried out to assess runoff volume reduction accurately,
then the model needs to incorporate an evapotranspiration rate relevant to the planting group, and a soil
store component which adjusts the evapotranspiration rate with the volume of water stored. The rate of
evapotranspiration is often assumed to be 3 mm/day in summer and 0 mm/day in mid-winter, but this may
be lower for sedum roofs.
Blue roofs can also provide a reduction in the volume of runoff due to evaporation, and this process will
be enhanced due to the solar warming of the water because of its shallow depth and exposed location.
This is likely to be more significant in climates warmer than that of the UK.
eedane o desin
Every roof structure and all roof drainage design should consider the impact of events that are greater
than the design event, and the risks associated with exceedance flows should be assessed and managed
in an appropriate and safe way, to protect people and property. As wash-off of material could take place
from green roofs, it is also important to assess potential failure mechanisms and their possible impacts.
This assessment should then result in mitigation by either design adaptations or provision of further
mitigation features.
12.5 TREATMENT DESIGN
The substrate used in the construction of green roofs should not add pollutants to the rainfall that percolates
through it in a way that some traditional roofing materials (eg copper) can. The pollutant haard will only be
dependent on atmospheric pollution and will therefore tend to be lower than from hard surfaces.
240 Part D: Technical detail
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Through a variety of physical, biological and chemical treatment processes, within the soil and root
uptake one, which filter airborne pollutants and pollutants entrained within rainwater, green roofs can
help to reduce the amount of pollution delivered to the local drainage system and, ultimately, to receiving
waters. Green roofs can provide further benefits in terms of moderating the temperature of the runoff
(runoff from impervious surfaces can be very warm during summer months, and high temperature
discharges can have negative effects on receiving water body ecology).
12.6 AMENITY DESIGN
Green roofs can be used to provide valuable amenity if the roof is intended to be accessible or is
overlooked. They can improve the roofscape for the surrounding community of office occupiers as well
as users of the green roof space itself, with the variety of planting and habitats creating a more colourful,
aesthetically pleasing and natural environment, particularly in dense urban areas (Figures 12.7 and 12.8).
Blue roofs tend to be constructed below the open space areas on podium decks, so the amenity value will
be defined by the aesthetics and use of this space. The design of green roofs for amenity should follow
standard industry practices for public spaces and accessible roof areas. They can also be integrated with
rainwater harvesting to provide a source of water for landscape irrigation or other non-potable uses.

CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Green roofs can be designed to deliver on a range of amenity principles including:
climate resilience through improved building thermal efficiency, reduced energy demand and
reduction of the urban heat island effect
improved air quality – via the absorption of carbon dioxide, some air pollutants and dust
reduced noise levels – due to extra acoustic dampening
increased building service life, and enhanced sales or rental value due to the high aesthetic appeal,
reduced energy costs and the building is associated with sustainable design and social responsibility.
Green roofs have also been shown to enhance the performance of photovoltaic panels where they are
used in combination (Zinco, 2011, and The Biosolar Roof Project: www.biosolarroof.com).
12.7 BIODIVERSITY DESIGN
Green roofs can be designed to provide high ecological value. They can help to conserve valuable habitat
and biodiversity and provide an oasis of life in an otherwise sterile urban environment. They can also
contribute to networks, clusters and corridors of green space that connect previously fragmented habitats.
Even in densely populated areas, birds, bees, butterflies and other insects and invertebrates can be
attracted to green roofs and gardens at great heights, which provide them with nesting and foraging
habitats (Johnston and Newton, 2004). Green rooftops can provide a micro “stepping stone” habitat for
birds and insects, connecting natural isolated habitat pockets with each other, or provide an “island”
habitat above those at ground level. Green roofs can be specifically designed to resemble endangered
ecosystems or habitats, by choosing appropriate layouts, designs and planting schemes that will provide
the desired habitat for the species concerned. Compared to conventional roofing, the soil and vegetation
on a green roof should also reduce the risk of raised runoff temperatures. This is particularly important
where the runoff is into sensitive water bodies.
A green roof designed for minimal maintenance means that habitats are less likely to be disturbed and,
with appropriate design, they can provide habitat for a wide range of vulnerable plants and ground-
nesting birds. Habitats can be further enhanced by incorporating artificial nesting sites, such as bat
boxes, bird boxes, bee hives/hotels.
Gedge et al (2012) describes how green roofs can be designed with invertebrates in mind. It suggests
that by doing this the overall ecological value of the green roof can be increased, and other benefits,
notably the attenuation of rainwater and evaporative cooling, can also be increased. The report reviews
over a decade of research on the biodiversity of green roofs in London and Switzerland. It notes that
it is possible to create arrested pioneer vegetation on green roofs, which is similar to some of the
open mosaic habitats found on unmanaged brownfield sites. Brownfield sites, which are targeted for
redevelopment by the planning system, often support rich assemblages of invertebrates. The loss of
some brownfield sites can be mitigated, in part, by creating similar habitats on roofs.
The research in Switzerland found that extensive green roofs support a wide range of beetles, spiders and
bees, including many red data book species (IUCN Red List of Threatened Species: www.iucnredlist.org).
Varying the topography on the roofs in Switzerland meant that species associated with both bare dry areas
as well as other species associated with more densely vegetated and damper mounds could occur together.
In London, comparisons between sedum dominated roofs and “biodiverse” roofs with a wider range of plant
species, showed that the number of invertebrate species on sedum roofs, though initially higher, fell over
time as the roofs dried out, whereas the fauna of biodiverse green roof increased as the roofs matured.
Both ubiquitous and specialist invertebrates are found on green roofs and a remarkably high percentage of
species found (over 10%) were locally or nationally scarce or rare.
The guidance recommends that sufficient depth of substrate is used on green roofs (no less than 0 mm)
and that the topography is varied in depth (typically between 0 and 150 mm) in order to provide a range
of habitats for invertebrates (Figure 12.10).

CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Figure 12.10 Biodiverse green roof with varied substrate depths (from Gedge et al, 2012)
The use of unscreened spoil or demolition waste
is now discouraged as a growing medium because
of problems with contamination and poor water
holding characteristics. This does not mean that
recycled materials cannot be used. They can be
used if carefully selected and their properties
evaluated for the proposed use. Normally,
commercially available proprietary substrates are
recommended, supplemented in places with sand,
stone, untreated timber or other materials to provide
habitat diversity. It is recommended that biodiverse
green roofs are seeded and plug planted with native
drought-tolerant wild flowers. Self-colonisation in
urban locations is no longer recommended, due to
problems with invasive non-native species, such
as Conyza. Water bodies or ephemerally wet areas
can be provided at roof level in the form of a pond,
undulations or merely as a series of water holding
containers (Figure 12.11).
The addition of photovoltaic panels on a green roof
can provide a complex habitat structure for eg black
redstarts (Phoenicurus ochruros), and microhabitats
for invertebrates.

12.8 PHYSICAL SPECIFICATIONS
12.8.1 Fire resistance
The fire resistance of green roofs should be considered. All openings, vents etc should be protected or
surrounded by non-vegetative materials such as pavers or pebbles or other proprietary fire-retardant
products. The roofs must have adequate resistance to the external spread of fire as required by Building
Regulation B4 (ODPM, 2002) or Regulation 12 in Scottish Government (2004). To achieve this, a risk
assessment should be undertaken, considering factors such as the organic content of the substrate, the
vegetation type and the effects of these on the spread of fire (Wilson et al, 2004). German authorities
only consider extensive roofs to be fire resistant if
the substrate/soil is >30 mm deep
the substrate/soil contains less than 20% organic matter
there is a 1 m wide gravel or slab fire break every 0 m
gravel strips are provided around all structures penetrating the roof (FLL, 2002).
Detailed guidance is set out in the document DCLG (2013).
12.8.2 Insulation
No extra insulation is required for the successful establishment of a green roof, but designers often use
the roof as an opportunity to improve the thermal efficiency of the building. Green roofs may be cold
where an air gap separates the membrane from the insulation beneath, or “warm” where insulation covers
the waterproof layer.
12.8.3 Roof pitch
To ensure the minimum finished fall of 1 in 0, as recommended for flat roofs in BS 6229200, falls
should be designed to 1 in 0. Falls should be consistently graded, without deflections or depressions.
The construction effort and cost of green roofs tends to increase with roof pitch. For roofs steeper than
1 in 10, rapid runoff should be prevented by increasing the retention capacity of the system (using check
dams or cellular storage structures). For roofs steeper than 1 in 5, specific design advice should be
sought to determine appropriate steps that are required to:
prevent soil slippage and erosion
provide extra support with cross battens
provide a raised grid structure to secure the plant growing substrate.
12.8.4 Roof support
The extra load imposed on the underpinning roof structure varies with the type of green roof, but it is
typically within a range of 0.75.0 kN/m2. Intensive green roofs with trees together with an imposed
“crowd” loading can impose loads of up to 10 kN/m2. The distributed load should account for a saturated
soil (and snow loadings, if appropriate), and live loadings should account for maintenance staff and
equipment, and visitors (if appropriate). Deeper planting beds can often be constructed over internal
columns and walls where a higher overall loading capacity can be provided. The design of the supporting
structure should only be undertaken by an experienced structural engineer.
Uplift pressures from wind are greatest at the corners of a roof, and these may be designated as
vegetation-free zones with pavers used to prevent damage. However, green roofs are no more vulnerable
to this threat than conventional roofing. Trees may require shielding from the wind and/or should be
anchored. On tall buildings, higher wind speeds may increase water loss and/or damage plants through
windburn, and may therefore prove a risk to the long-term survival or plant communities. Barriers (eg
parapet walls) can be used to mitigate these effects.
Chapter 12: Green roofs

CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
12.8.5 Water storage and irrigation
Green roofs should be able to store water and not dry out too quickly. If this is not possible within the soil
substrate, then additional forms of water storage in the base layer can be provided, or irrigation may be
appropriate. Irrigation systems are generally not recommended for extensive roofs, due to the costs and
operation associated with their implementation and management. However, they are often necessary for
intensive roofs. If irrigation is required, base level irrigators that introduce water directly to the root zones
via the drainage layer have the following advantages:
Roots are encouraged to grow down into the deepest part of the soil medium where temperature and
moisture conditions are most stable.
A dry surface cover is maintained, thus discouraging the germination of weed seeds.
Water losses due to evaporation are minimised.
However, if the system blocks, then it may need to be dug up which is likely to be costly.
More sustainable permanent irrigation systems include the use of air conditioning condensate or other
readily-available non-potable supplies.
Provision might need to be made for supplemental irrigation during the first two growing seasons after
installation to ensure plant survival, depending on the location and the types of plants being grown.
On blue roofs or mixed blue/green roofs, water can be stored for irrigation of the surrounding landscape
by either active or passive irrigation systems.
ess and safe orin
Stairways, perimeter barriers, safe paths and in some cases lighting and lifts, all built to the relevant
standards, are required if the green roof is to be used by people, whether the public or maintenance staff.
Appropriate provision of safety attachment points and other features should be used to provide a safe
working environment.
12.8.7 Pre-treatment and inlets
There is no requirement for pre-treatment or inlets for a green roof unless irrigation water is being
applied. Standard pre-treatment/inlet requirements will need to be considered for drainage on blue roofs.
12.8.8 Outlets
All types of outlet should be designed in order to minimise the risk of blockage, which could have serious
consequences. They should also be easily accessible for seasonal cleaning and in case of blockage. Detailed
guidance on the capacity and location of rainwater gutters and outlets is given in BS 12056-2000. Rainwater
outlets should accept runoff from both the drainage layer and the surface of the system.
Outlets should be separated from the growing medium, preventing the invasion of plant growth and the
entry of loose gravel, as shown in Figure 12.14. Outlets can include flow control systems designed to
control flows into roof downpipes and thus deliver specific attenuation performance.

12.9 MATERIALS
Information on each of the material layers is provided in the following sections.
Detailed information is provided by Early et al (2007), the Greenroof Centre (2011) and GRO (2014).
12.9.1 Waterproof membrane
A high quality, robust waterproofing layer is required and is a vital component of the system. Waterproof
membranes can be made of a range of materials including reinforced polyvinyl chloride, synthetic rubber,
thermoplastic polyolefins, high density polyethylene, modified asphalts and hypalon.
The waterproofing layer may need to be anchored to the roof to resist wind uplift forces if plastic sheeting
is used. Waterproof membranes should be root resistant and should be adequately protected from
temperature changes and mechanical damage to ensure that the integrity of the lower building fabric is
retained. BS 6229200 should be referenced together with other relevant waterproofing specifications.
Care should be taken to ensure reliability of membranes, as repairs are difficult once the green roof is
completed. It is therefore recommended that membranes are electronically tested for leaks, or flood
tested, before the covering elements are installed.
12.9.2 Root barrier
Root barriers are used to prevent roots from damaging the waterproof membrane. Root barriers can often
be avoided through the use of careful waterproofing and appropriate design. The waterproof membrane
manufacturer should be consulted to determine whether or not a root barrier is required.
Chapter 12: Green roofs
247
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
12.9.3 The drainage layer
The drainage layer is located over the
waterproofing layer and underlies the
entire green roof. Its principal function
is to drain excess water from the roof,
but it can be designed to retain specific
volumes of water for attenuation, and/
or retain some water for plants to draw
on when rainfall is low. It connects to
gutters and downpipes, typically via
geocomposite/geocellular drainage
systems that are lightweight and provide
efficient drainage.
The layer should have sufficient flow
capacity to carry the necessary volume
of water from the roof. Flow capacity
will depend on a number of factors,
Figure 12.15 (courtesy Clare Dinham)
Installing a green roof outlet with surface overflow
the principal ones being the hydraulic
gradient and the hydrostatic pressure
applied to the geocomposite. The performance specification of the proposed material should be checked
against relevant European Standards (eg BS EN 12522001) for the hydraulic gradients and pressures
relevant for the specific application.
A shallow layer of gravel or pebbles over a width of approximately 300–400 mm from the outside
perimeter of the roof is often useful, providing protection for the vegetation from wind vortices, extra
drainage close to outlets, fire control and access to the roof edges for maintenance (Figure 12.15).
eotetie fiter aer
Geotextiles prevent clogging of the drainage layer by separating it from the growing medium above. It
should have zero breakthrough head (ie water discharges through it without building up on the upstream
side) so that it does not impede the passage of water. It is essential to mark the position of the roof outlets
before installing the protection layer, so that they can be easily located and the filter layer cut accordingly.
Reliable detailing at points where the filter layer is penetrated, for example by pipework, and perimeter
areas with durable protection is critical.
Soi or roin medium
The depth of soil medium and the material used should be selected to support the vegetation proposed.
An important design consideration is balancing the benefits associated with greater depths of soil
against the extra structural loadings that this imposes. Typically a minimum of 80 mm thickness is
acceptable to give a reasonable variety of plants, although greater depths contribute to wind stability,
increase insulation effect, increase rainfall storage and protect the roots from frost damage. The depths
appropriate for various types of vegetation are summarised in Table 12.3.
Low density soils with good water retention and reasonable fertility are required, and mixtures of organic
and mineral material (for example, recycled crushed brick or pumice) are suitable. Appropriate materials
need to be:
reasonably water permeable
water and air retentive
resistant to decay, heat, frost and shrinkage
suitable in terms of nutrient content
a good rooting medium.
248 Part D: Technical detail
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Normal topsoil is too heavy and too nutrient rich for use on green roof systems and has a tendency to
clog the filter layer. The growing medium should be carefully formulated so that it is light but provides
for the oxygen, nutrient and moisture needed by the plants that the roof aims to support. An appropriate
specification for soil for use on extensive roofs is provided in Table 12.3.

The rooftop microclimate is a difficult environment for plants to survive in, and the advice of a landscape
architect or similar professional with experience of green roofs is essential. The vegetation has to deal
with periodic rainfall alternating with hot and dry periods. Plants also have to contend with high winds and
low winter temperatures (which is not ameliorated by the ambient heat stored in the ground).
To be able to survive, vegetation should have the following attributes:
perennial or self-sowing
drought tolerant, requiring little or no irrigation after establishment
preference for well-drained soils
rapid establishment
self-sustaining, without the need for fertilisers, pesticides or herbicides
ability to withstand heat, cold and high winds
ability to tolerate poor soil
low maintenance – needing little or no mowing or pruning
Some of these attributes may not be so relevant for intensive roofs where regular maintenance and
irrigation can be provided, and where the depth of growing medium is less constrained. The choice
of plants also depends on the other layers in the roof design (and vice versa) and on sun and shade
conditions. In many cases there may be very good reasons to promote a wide range of plants, for
example to improve water storage, improve evapotranspiration, enhance the aesthetics of the roof or
encourage biodiversity. The use of a wider range of plants is dependent on other layers in the system
and the accessibility or visibility of the roof. Claridge and Edwards (2012) suggest that planting a green
roof with different species that have high water uptake rates under different soil moisture conditions
can improve green roof performance. Suggestions for relevant plants with increasing depth of growing
medium are given in Table 12.4.

Further planting guidance is provided by Early et al (2007), The Greenroof Centre and GRO (2014).
There are four basic methods of installing green roof vegetation:
Pre-grown vegetation mats: These are pre-germinated mats that provide immediate full plant
coverage and erosion control. These have minimal weed problems and require little maintenance,
but may need some watering during the establishment period.
Plugs or potted plants: These may provide more flexibility, but coverage takes longer, and erosion
may be a risk. They will require watering and weeding during establishment.
Cuttings/sprigs: These have to be hand planted, and require weeding, erosion control and
watering initially.
Seeds: These have to be hand or machine planted, and require weeding, erosion control and
watering initially.
Self-seeding: Green roofs can be left to colonise naturally.
Intensive green roofs can be landscaped and managed to suit local aesthetic and community
requirements. Extensive green roofs tend to provide less conventional aesthetics. In practice, green
roofs in city centres are not obvious to most passers-by, although they can be overlooked by high-rise
buildings. Use of green roofs in suburban areas tend to use pitched roofs which are more visible.
12.11 CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS
Advice on constructing green roofs is provided in Early et al (2007), The Greenroof Centre and
GRO (2014).
250 Part D: Technical detail
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Correct application of the waterproof membrane is essential to the viability of the green roof. Quality
control must be assured through the use of certified roofing procedures and an electronic water leakage
test immediately following membrane application to ensure that the surface is impermeable.
Temporary ballasting of individual components may be required during construction to prevent uplift
due to wind. The growing medium should be protected from over-compaction during construction, and
mulch, mat or other measures to control erosion of the growing medium should be maintained until 90%
vegetation coverage is achieved. The growing medium and separation fabric should be isolated from
sedimentation during construction.
Safe access is required for construction of the green roof, and also for all activities in areas beneath
the roof. Ideally, the roof should be installed when no follow-on trades need access to the roof after
installation, in order to reduce the risk of damage.
Further detail on construction activities and the programming of construction activities is provided in
Chapter 31.
Generic health and safety guidance is presented in Chapter 36.
A construction phase health and safety plan is required under the Construction (Design and
Management) Regulations (CDM) 2015. This should ensure that all construction risks have been
identified and eliminated/reduced and/or controlled where appropriate.
12.12 OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS
Intensive green roofs are likely to require regular inspection and maintenance. Grassed areas may require
mowing weekly or fortnightly, plant beds may require weeding on a weekly or fortnightly basis during
the growing season, and wildflower meadows may require annual mowing with the cuttings removed.
Extensive green roofs should normally only require biannual or annual visits to remove litter, check fire
breaks and drains and, in some cases, remove unwanted invasive plants. The most maintenance is
generally required during the establishment stage (12 to 15 months), and this should usually be made the
responsibility of the green roof provider. Maintenance contractors with specialist training in green roof
care should be used, where possible.
Table 12.5 provides guidance on the type of operational and maintenance requirements that may be
appropriate. The list of actions is not exhaustive and some actions may not always be required. Actual
requirements will depend on the planting, the desired aesthetic and visual effect and the biodiversity
objectives for the system. Maintenance specifications and schedules should therefore be specified for
any individual green roof.
If mechanical systems are located on the roof, then spill prevention measures should be exercised to
ensure that roof runoff is not contaminated. The mechanical system area should be bunded and provided
with separate drainage.
All maintenance actions carried out at roof level must be in full compliance with the appropriate health
and safety regulations, and particularly those specifically dealing with working at height. Training and
guidance information on operating and maintaining the roof should be provided to all property owners and
tenants. Safety fastenings will be required for personnel working on the roof.
Access routes to the roof should be designed and maintained to be safe and efficient, and walkways
should always be kept clear of obstructions. Secure points for harness attachments should be provided
when access near to the roof edges is required.
Specific maintenance needs of the green roof should be monitored and maintenance schedules adjusted
to suit requirements.

13.1 GENERAL DESCRIPTION
There are many different types of drainage component that can be used to facilitate
infiltration. These include soakaways, infiltration trenches, infiltration blankets and
infiltration basins. Bioretention systems and pervious pavement can also be designed to
allow infiltration from their bases (Chapters 18 and 20 respectively).
Infiltration can contribute to reducing runoff rates and volumes while supporting
baseflow and groundwater recharge processes. The rate at which water can be
infiltrated depends on the infiltration capacity (permeability) of the surrounding soils.
Soakaways are excavations that are filled with a void-forming material that allows
the temporary storage of water before it soaks into the ground. Historically, small
soakaways draining runoff from a single property were either filled with rubble or lined
with brickwork and were sited below gardens and drives with no formal provision for
access and inspection. Many small soakaways are now constructed with geocellular
units available from builders’ merchants pre-wrapped in geotextile. The geocellular units
provide good overall storage capacity compared to rubble fill, and they allow the sie of
the structure required for any application to be minimised.
Larger soakaways may be constructed with perforated precast concrete manhole rings
surrounded with granular backfill or using geocellular structures (Chapter 21). Concrete
manhole soakaways have the advantage of access for inspection and maintenance
(although any gravel surround cannot be inspected or easily maintained). When
considering the use of geocellular systems, the long-term structural integrity, acceptance
for adoption by the SuDS system asset owner/operator and the anticipated service life of
the asset should be addressed.
Figure 13.1 shows the characteristics of a typical geocellular soakaway with pre-
treatment for a larger system and Figure 13.2 shows a precast concrete system.
Alternative configurations for geocellular systems are described in Chapter 21.
Chapter 1 Infiltration systems

Figure 1.2 Soakaway details concrete ring soakaway
Infiltration trenes are simply linear soakaways. The advantages of trenches over cuboid soakaways
is that they can often be kept shallower and, in variable soils, can help distribute the infiltration area so
that the impact of less permeable areas of soil is less pronounced. A perforated pipe can be included, if
required, to distribute water along the trench. Details are shown in Figure 13.3.
Infiltration asins are flat-bottomed, shallow landscape depressions that store runoff (allowing
pollutants to settle and filter out) before infiltration into the subsurface soils.
Schematics for infiltration basins are shown in Figure 13.4 and Figure 13.5.
Infiltration lanets are large shallow systems that are typically constructed using permeable aggregate
or geocellular units that act as extensive soakaway systems. Examples include below car parks where the
storage layer is part of the car park pavement construction, below playgrounds or below sports pitches.

Trees are beneficial in infiltration basins as they help maintain infiltration rates of the soil. However, the
design should ensure the trees selected are capable of thriving in the conditions likely to be present in
the basin.

13.2 GENERAL DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS
Infiltration systems facilitate the discharge of surface water runoff to the ground and ultimately into
groundwater. It is therefore crucial that any runoff is suitably clean before entering the infiltration
component so that the groundwater is not put at risk of contamination.
The performance of infiltration systems is dependent on the infiltration capacity of the surrounding soils
and the depth to groundwater. Effective upstream pre-treatment is required to remove sediment and silt
loads to prevent long-term clogging and subsequent failure of the system. Construction best practice
(Setion ) is also crucial to preventing damage to the subsoil structure (and permeability) before
commissioning of the system.

Large infiltration basins, Ipswich (courtesy
Figure 1.7 (courtesy Illman Young)
Small infiltration basin, Cambourne
A minimum distance of 1 m between the base of the infiltration system and the maximum likely
groundwater level should always be adopted. This is to minimise the risk of groundwater rising into
the infiltration component and reducing the available storage volume, to protect the functionality of the
infiltration process by ensuring a sufficient depth of unsaturated material and to protect the groundwater
from any contamination in the runoff.
The following issues should be assessed as part of the design process for infiltration systems
risk of ground instability, subsidence or heave due to infiltration
260 Part D: Technical detail
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
risk of slope instability or solifluction due to infiltration
risk of groundwater pollution from mobilising existing contaminants on the site
risk of pollution from infiltrating polluted surface water runoff from the site
risk of groundwater flooding due to infiltration
risk of groundwater leakage into the sewers, basements, tunnels or other structures due to
promoting infiltration on the site.
The evaluation and management of these risks is discussed in detail in Chapter 25. The design should
ensure that, after construction, the residual risks will be acceptable.
The bottom of any infiltration system should be flat to provide uniform ponding and infiltration of the runoff
across the surface. The tolerance on the base levels should be a maximum level difference of 10 mm in m.
The side slopes of infiltration basins should normally be no steeper than 1 in to allow for vegetative
stabilisation, mowing, access and for public safety reasons. However, this requirement may be relaxed
if a basin is very shallow (eg less than 500 mm deep). Stepped or benched slopes also offer a range of
habitats that can survive fluctuating water levels and wet to dry soil conditions.
Where the temporary storage of water occurs on the surface in open features (ie infiltration basins), the
depths and rate of rise of the water should be sufficiently low such that risks posed by the water body are
minimised for site users and operators (taking into account the temporary nature of the storage facility
which will mean that users are not accustomed to its presence). A risk assessment should be undertaken
of the frequency and rate of flooding to a range of inundation depths in order that public safety is not put
at risk (Chapter 36). Flatter slopes tend to improve the aesthetics, at the expense of extra land-take.
There should always be appropriate access to the infiltration basin for maintenance activities such as
grass cutting and rehabilitation of the infiltration surface. Where trees are planted in basins they should
not prevent access or deter future maintenance (eg because of root protection ones).
Any inspection chambers should aim to allow maintenance from the surface without requiring man entry.
Health and safety risk management design guidance is presented in Chapter 36.
13.3 SELECTION AND SITING OF INFILTRATION COMPONENTS
Soakaways are best suited to the infiltration of runoff from small areas such as roofs of residential
housing.
Infiltration components can often be retrofitted into existing developments, to drain small areas such
as private driveways and roof drainage, providing there is sufficient offset from structures, slopes etc
(Chapter 25). On sloping sites they may be able to be designed as a series of smaller units, rather than
one large system, that are located on plateaus within the site (eg parking areas). They can also be used
to manage overflows from water butts and other rainwater collection systems. The subsurface infiltration
components require no net land-take. They can be built in many shapes and sies and can often be
accommodated within high-density urban developments. However, it is usually not desirable to use
open-access infiltration basins within public open space that involves a lot of pedestrian traffic, due to
the risk of deterioration of the performance of the infiltration surface due to compaction of the surface
soils. Infiltration systems should not normally be used to drain landscaping or other areas with high risks
of soil erosion and loadings, due to the risk of sediment blockage and clogging of the soils surrounding
the component.
Constraints on the use and siting of infiltration systems are discussed in Chapter 25.
Chapter 1 Infiltration systems

CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
13.4 HYDRAULIC DESIGN
enera
Infiltration systems should be designed to manage storms up to the design standard of service required
for the contributing catchment area this could be the 110 or 10 year storm, or larger. As discharge
criteria from a development site are usually based on a 1100 year event plus an allowance for climate
change, the performance of infiltration systems under such conditions needs to be known. For ease of
design, and to minimise the occurrence of surface flooding within the development, this may result in the
soakaways being designed to manage the 1100 year event (plus climate change allowance).
The design of infiltration components should follow the advice in Chapter 25.
The infiltration component should discharge from full to half-full within a reasonable time so that the risk
of it not being able to manage a subsequent rainfall event is minimised. Where components are designed
to manage the 110 year or 10 year event, it is usual to specify that half emptying occurs within 2
hours. If components are designed to infiltrate events greater than the 10 year event, designing to half
empty in 2 hours can result in very large storage requirements and, with agreement from the drainage
approving body, it may be appropriate to allow longer half emptying times. This decision should be based
on an assessment of the performance of the system and the risk and consequences of consecutive
rainfall events occurring.
The procedures outlined in Chapter 25 should be followed for the hydraulic design of infiltration
components.
nteretion desin
Infiltration can play an important role in providing Interception the capture and retention of the first 5 mm
of any rainfall event, even on sites with low infiltration rates.
Further guidance on Interception is provided in Setion .
ea o ontro desin
Infiltration reduces required attenuation storage volumes. The extent of this reduction for any return
period will be dependent on the design standard of service, the volume of storage provided and the
infiltration capacity of the surrounding soils.
Guidance on designing for attenuation storage is provided in Setion .
oume ontro desin
Infiltration reduces the volume of runoff. The extent of this reduction for any return period will be
dependent on the design standard of service and the infiltration capacity of the surrounding soils.
eedane o desin
Infiltration components should be designed so that exceedance flows are managed effectively. An
exceedance flow route or temporary storage area (eg an open space or external area) will be required for
rainfall events that exceed the design capacity of the infiltration system. This can be achieved by installing
an overflow pipe above the design water storage level of the infiltration systems and conveying runoff
flows downstream or by effective management of volumes of water that surcharge the system.
Guidance on exceedance design is provided in Setion .
262 Part D: Technical detail
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
13.5 TREATMENT DESIGN
The acceptability of infiltration design, from a groundwater protection perspective, will depend on the
extent of the likely runoff contamination and site and ground characteristics. An evaluation should be
undertaken using the water quality risk assessment (Setion ). A depth of at least 1 m of unsaturated
soils that are not clean gravels or similar with high permeabilities, and/or are not fractured deposits with
rapid flow routes (preferably with some organic and clay content) are known to provide good protection to
underlying groundwater.
Sedimentation tends to occur within the temporary storage area and an allowance should always be
made for this or, preferably, upstream SuDS components put in place to remove sediment before entering
the component.
The deeper an infiltration system is, the greater the risk of bypassing the protective upper soil layers and
decreasing the distance to the water table. This can lead to an increased risk of groundwater pollution.
In this respect shallow and dispersed systems are usually best. Geotextile layers can be used within
infiltration components for additional trapping of surface water runoff particulates and hydrocarbons.
Setion sets out the key processes that have been found to be important for groundwater
protection from urban runoff.
13.6 AMENITY DESIGN
Soakaways and trenches do not usually have any inherent amenity value, but subsurface systems can
promote the multi-functional use of space by allowing the overlying surface to be used for recreation or
other amenity facilities.
The use of infiltration basins as amenity features needs to be balanced against the increased
maintenance requirements this can cause. If the basin is purely aesthetic or biodiverse and is not used
as an active or passive recreation space then there is no real increase in maintenance. If the surface is
going to be used by pedestrians or used for playing informal sports, this can cause the surface to become
compacted and require more frequent maintenance to maintain the infiltration capacity. Engineered soils
on the surface are less likely to be adversely affected and lose infiltration capacity. Planting trees and
shrubs rather than just grass, and mulching the surface layers will also help maintain the infiltration rates
(although the presence of trees should not impede future maintenance Setion ).
Basins should be designed with shallow side-slopes and benching, which will help mitigate safety risks
and also provide for biodiversity and habitat creation. The form and aesthetic appearance of the facility
will depend on specific site characteristics, local public concerns, and development design criteria.
Fencing is generally not desirable as it may reduce the amenity benefits provided by the infiltration facility,
provide a barrier to easy maintenance and provide a trap where litter and dead vegetative material could
collect. Where fences are required, they should be low (toddler-proof), but facilitate movement of wildlife.
More information about the need for fences around SuDS is provided on the Susdrain website
www.susdrain.org and in Chapter 36.
Community engagement is discussed in Chapter 34
Landscape and planting best practice is presented in Chapter 29.
13.7 BIODIVERSITY DESIGN
The ecological value of the system can be enhanced by diversifying the planting (eg including trees,
woody shrubs, wildflower mixes Chapter 29 and Chapter 6) or by including bioretention areas within
the design.
Chapter 1 Infiltration systems
26
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
13.8 PHYSICAL SPECIFICATIONS
For soakaways, the void should (where required) be separated from the surrounding soil using a suitable
geotextile. This will support the soil around the soakaway and prevent the ingress of backfill material into
the top of the soakaway during and after surface reinstatement. Characteristics of the geotextile should
suit the surrounding soil particle sie and permeability.
Guidance on suitable geotextile specifications is given in Setion .
Soakaways should be of sufficient strength to cater for the loads acting on them during construction
and during their service life, especially where they are required to be traffic bearing. The long-term
strength of materials should be carefully considered. The design and specification of geocellular
soakaways should follow the guidance in Chapter 21 regarding structural design and material
specification. Precast concrete manholes should be subject to the normal structural design/
specification for concrete drainage structures.
retreatment and inets
Infiltration components can be susceptible to high failure rates due to clogging from sediments and
therefore require effective pre-treatment to remove as much of both the suspended solids and fine
silts from the runoff as possible, before they enter the system. Silt that causes clogging of infiltration
systems is mainly 6 mm diameter which is very small (Siriwardene et al, 2007). Designs should
ideally incorporate multiple pre-treatment, using practices such as swales, sediment basins and
filter strips in series upstream of the infiltration basin to minimise the risks. However, often this is not
practical and for a small soakaway serving a roof, a small catchpit may be the only pre-treatment that
can effectively be provided.
An infiltration component can be designed offline to provide volume control in larger events. This means
that low flows do not enter the system (which minimises the risk of clogging, but means the component
cannot deliver Interception for the contributing catchment).
Inlet channels to infiltration basins should be stabilised using appropriate erosion control, such as rip-rap,
although in a well-designed system, flows will be low and erosion protection requirements should be
minimal. A level spreader should also be provided at the inlet to the basin from the pre-treatment system
to promote shallow sheet flow into the basin, which will maximise pollutant removal opportunities, and
reduce the risks of erosion.
utets
Overflow of excess surface water runoff can be via a piped outlet or overflow or from the top of the
soakaway, if considered appropriate, or a weir overflow from a basin. The overflow should not impede
access to any inlet/outlet/control structure that manages more frequent flows.
13.9 MATERIALS
The materials used in infiltration components are mainly aggregate, geotextiles and engineered soils
such as root one or amended soils for simple bioretention systems.
Top soils or engineered soils used in infiltration basins should be sufficiently permeable. The minimum
permeability assumed in the design should be stated, and the material should be tested after it has been
placed in accordance with the method described for bioretention soils in Chapter 18.
Further information on engineered soils and filter media is provided in Chapters 30 and 18.
26 Part D: Technical detail
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
13.10 LANDSCAPE DESIGN AND PLANTING
Infiltration basins are typically grassed structures, but some additional vegetation can enhance the
appearance of the basin, stabilise side slopes and prevent erosion, and serve as wildlife habitat.
Planting should be designed to suit the specific anticipated site conditions which will vary from wet to
dry conditions. Native plants and vegetation may be preferable and more hardy to survive expected
fluctuations in soil water levels.
Vegetation also increases the effectiveness of infiltration by slowing the flows across the basin and by
maintaining or enhancing the pore space in the underlying soils via deeper rooting systems. Dense
vegetation such as shrubs and mulching will also minimise the risk of clogging of surface soils (Emerson
and Traver, 200).
Any planting in an infiltration basin should be able to withstand periods of ponding and lengthy dry
periods . In order to reduce maintenance requirements and increase aesthetic and biodiversity value,
planting with wild flower meadow mixes can be considered (Chapter 29).
Infiltration components can attract the roots of plants growing in their vicinity particularly if the plants
do not have a separate supply of water. This is, to a certain extent, an advantage as plant roots take
up extra water from the system and roots provide extra openings in the surrounding soil for water to
infiltrate. However, too vigorous root intrusion into subsurface systems, especially from larger shrubs and
trees, should be kept in check as it can fill a significant percentage of the void space required for runoff
attenuation and can also cause structural damage.
Fertilising and the application of herbicides to an infiltration system should be avoided to minimise the risk
of pollutants and nutrients entering the groundwater.
Landscape design and planting best practice is presented in detail in Chapter 29.
13.11 CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS
Many reported failures of infiltration systems can be attributed to poor design, inappropriate soils and
careless construction. The construction process therefore needs careful planning and implementation to
ensure that it does not adversely affect the infiltration performance of the systems.
Further detail on construction activities and the programming of construction activities is provided in
Chapter 31.
Generic health and safety guidance is presented in Chapter 36.
A construction phase health and safety plan is required under the Construction (Design and
Management) Regulations (CDM) 2015. This should ensure that all construction risks have been
identified and eliminated/reduced and/or controlled where appropriate.
Soaaas trenhes and banets
Soakaways, trenches and blankets should not be used for untreated drainage from construction sites,
where runoff is likely to contain silt, debris and other pollutants.
Perforated, precast concrete ring soakaways should be installed within a square pit, with side dimensions
about twice the selected ring diameter. The need to oversie the soakaway pit for the purposes of
constructing the ring unit chamber may be used to advantage by incorporating the total excavation
volume below the discharge invert in the design storage volume (BRE, 1991). Excavations should be
backfilled with a suitable permeable aggregate material such as Type B filter material, pea gravel or /0
aggregate in accordance with BS 75-12009) see Chapter 20 and Chapter 30.
Chapter 1 Infiltration systems
265
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Some normally highly permeable soils and soft rocks (eg chalk) can have their permeability significantly
reduced by smearing of the surface during excavation, especially by mechanical diggers. It is
recommended that the exposed surface of the soil is manually cleaned of any smearing before the
geotextile and granular fill surrounding any infiltration system are installed.
nfitration basins
Where possible, construction of infiltration basins should take place after the site has been stabilised,
in order to minimise the risk of premature system failure due to high sediment loadings in runoff from
disturbed ground. If this is not possible, then initial excavation should be carried out to within 50 mm
of the basin floor, and final excavation should be delayed until after site stabilisation. It is essential that
infiltration basins should not be used to manage construction runoff and trap construction sediments.
Topsoil should not be laid in basins when the ground or the topsoil is saturated. This may be a constraint
to the use of infiltration basins if the construction programme is particularly tight.
All excavation and levelling should be performed by equipment with tracks that exert very light pressures,
to prevent compaction of the basin floor, which may reduce infiltration capacity. Before and after
construction, other vehicular movements should be prevented.
The base of the basin should be carefully prepared to an even grade with no significant undulations. The
surface soils within the basin should not be smeared or compacted during construction. After final grading,
the basin floor should be tilled to a depth of 150 mm to provide a well-aerated, porous surface texture.
Backfilling against inlet and outlet structures needs to be controlled to minimise settlement and erosion.
The topsoils used to finish the side slopes need to be suitably fertile, porous and of sufficient depth to
ensure healthy vegetation growth.
Immediately following basin construction, the base and side slopes should be stabilised with a dense
coverage of water-tolerant grass.
13.12 OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS
Infiltration systems will require regular maintenance to ensure continuing operation to design performance
standards, and all designers should provide detailed specifications and frequencies for the required
maintenance activities along with likely machinery requirements and typical annual costs within the
Maintenance Plan. Different designs will have different operation and maintenance requirements, and this
section gives some generic guidance for different system types.
Soaaas trenhes and banets
The design of soakaways, infiltration trenches and blankets should include monitoring points where the
water level in the system can be observed or measured. This can either be via an inspection well or
inspection cover (where the attenuation storage space is a void). For larger installations the inspection
access should provide a clear view of the infiltration surface (even if the storage one is filled). For small,
filled soakaways, a 50 mm perforated pipe is adequate.
The useful life and effective operation of an infiltration component is related to the frequency of
maintenance and the risk of sediment being introduced into the system.
An easement should be considered where multiple properties discharge to a single soakaway, to ensure
long-term access for maintenance purposes.
ale provides guidance on the type of operational and maintenance requirements that may
be appropriate for soakaways. The list of actions is not exhaustive and some actions may not
always be required.

Maintenance will usually be carried out manually, although a suction tanker can be used for sediment/

hard-packed and require considerable effort to remove.
Replacement of the aggregate or geocellular units will be necessary if the system becomes blocked
with silt. Effective monitoring will give information on changes in infiltration rate and provide a warning of
potential failure in the long term.
Roads and/or parking areas draining to infiltration components should be regularly swept to prevent silt
being washed off the surface. This will minimise the need for maintenance.
Maintenance responsibility should be placed with an appropriate organisation, and maintenance
schedules should be developed during the design phase.
Generic health and safety guidance is presented in Chapter 36.
CDM 2015 requires designers to ensure that all maintenance risks have been identified and eliminated/
reduced and/or controlled where appropriate. This information will be required as part of the health and
safety file.
nfitration basins
Regular inspection and maintenance is important for the effective operation of infiltration basins as
designed. Maintenance responsibility for an infiltration basin and its surrounding area should be placed
with a responsible organisation.
Regular mowing in and around infiltration basins is only required along maintenance access routes, amenity
areas (eg footpaths), across embankments and across the main storage area. The remaining areas can
be managed as meadow or other appropriate vegetation, unless additional management is required for
landscaping purposes. Grass cutting may need to accommodate specific sward mixes and specialist seed
or turf supplier recommendations. As described earlier in this chapter, deep-rooting vegetation can maintain
infiltration rates and minimise the need for remedial maintenance. All vegetation management activities
should take account of the need to maximise biosecurity and prevent the spread of invasive species.

Accumulated sediments on the surface of infiltration systems have been shown not to pose a haard
to human health, where people are using the basin as an open space (Scott Wilson, 2010). However,
Scott Wilson (2010) shows that the accumulated material exceeded the total organic carbon (TOC)
criteria for haardous waste, and the accumulated sediment would require waste pre-treatment to lower
the organic content before off-site disposal (other contaminant levels were well below haardous waste
criteria). Composting or windrowing might achieve this. Excavated sediment from infiltration basins
or pre-treatment component that receive runoff from residential or standard road and roof areas are
generally not toxic and can therefore be safely disposed of by either land application or off-site disposal.
However, consultation should take place with the environmental regulator to confirm appropriate
protocols. Sediment testing may be required before sediment excavation, to determine its classification
and appropriate disposal methods. For industrial site runoff, sediment testing will be essential. In the
majority of cases, it will be acceptable to distribute the sediment on site if there is an appropriate safe and
acceptable location to do so.

Further information on waste management is provided in Chapter 33.
Maintenance Plans and schedules should be developed before maintenance contracts are
commissioned. Specific maintenance needs of the basin should be monitored, and maintenance
schedules adjusted to suit requirements.
CDM 2015 requires designers to ensure that all maintenance risks have been identified, eliminated,
reduced and/or controlled where appropriate. This information will be required as part of the health and
safety file.
Generic health and safety guidance is presented in Chapter 36.
Provided preventive maintenance measures are conscientiously undertaken, the need for corrective
maintenance should rarely arise.
Additional detail on the preparation of maintenance specifications and schedules of work is given in
Chapter 32.

14Chapter Proprietary treatment
systems
This chapter provides guidance on the design of proprietary treatment
systems – surface and subsurface manufactured products designed to
provide treatment of water through the removal of contaminants.
14.1 GENERAL DESCRIPTION
Proprietary treatment systems are manufactured products that remove specified
pollutants from surface water runoff. They are especially useful where site constraints
preclude the use of other methods or where they offer specific benefits in facilitating the
delivery of SuDS design criteria for a site. They are often (but not always) subsurface
structures and can often be complementary to landscaped features, reducing pollutant
levels in the runoff and protecting the amenity and/or biodiversity functionality of
downstream SuDS components. They can be useful in reducing the maintenance
requirements of downstream SuDS or in avoiding the risk of disturbance of those areas
during routine silt removal operations. Historically, they have only been considered as
pre-treatment devices, but they can provide a valuable function in removing pollutants
from runoff and may therefore be considered as an integral part of the Management
Train in some situations. Systems are available that deliver reductions in a wide range of
contaminants, and increasingly sophisticated proprietary systems are being developed
for use in treating runoff from developments.
Proprietary treatment systems may require more routine maintenance than other
methods to ensure functionality, although it is confined to a single location and is
engineering based, which may be advantageous to some owners or operators and can
reduce overall maintenance costs (HA, 201). Their treatment performance may also
be more dependent on routine inspection or maintenance than other types of SuDS,
although this will be system and design specific. Where large volumes of sediment
may accumulate in the device, suction equipment is usually needed to remove it,
and appropriate access will have to be provided. Where there is no indication that
maintenance is required (such as an alarm or visible surface ponding when full) then
maintenance regimes need to be robust, so that activities will be triggered despite the
lack of system visibility on the surface.
When designed in accordance with this manual, SuDS components, such as pervious
pavements and swales, generally deliver treatment alongside hydraulic control and
amenity and biodiversity benefits. With proprietary treatment systems, Interception
and attenuation will usually need to be delivered separately using either surface or
subsurface storage, and alternative means of delivering amenity and biodiversity criteria
will also need to be considered.
14.2 GENERAL DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS
There are various types of treatment system available. These have been split into different
groups based on the main processes that occur within the systems, following an adaptation
of the approach described by Leisenring et al (2012). The main treatment processes (or
process groups) that can occur in the most commonly available proprietary systems are

These are effectively prefabricated, bioretention systems or tree pits and should behave and be
designed as such (Chapter 18 and Chapter 19). They may include proprietary filter media that should
be demonstrated as meeting the criteria set by the Facility for Advanced Water Biofiltration (FAWB)
(Chapter 18) or provide equivalent or improved hydraulic and water quality performance. The proprietary
structure can provide protection for tree roots from compaction if required, but a sufficient volume of soil
should be provided for healthy tree growth (Chapter 19).
14.2.2 Treatment channels
Treatment channels are surface channel drainage systems that are modified to prevent or reduce water
flow along them with baffles and/or weirs at intervals or, if a filter material is included, via holes in the
base. Each section of channel may have its own outlet. The channels are a source control method and
are different from standard channels that simply convey water to other features. They act as collectors
of water from adjacent impermeable surfaces and then store it before allowing the water to discharge
downstream to the next part of the system. The key to their successful use is that they should drain
relatively small areas of hard surface to each metre of channel so that runoff volumes and pollution loads
on any section of the channel are low (usually less than 25 m2 per metre length of channel for separation
channels and up to 100 m2 per metre length for filtration channels, although it will be specific to each site
and to the dimensions of a particular unit). The low flows also minimise emulsification of oils and help in
their removal.
The two main types of treatment channel are differentiated by the process within them
With separation, particulate pollutants are trapped by gravity separation (settling) and floatables
such as oils by physical separation using weir and baffle plates. They will not remove dissolved
contaminants. A limited amount of biodegradation of hydrocarbons occurs this occurs as the
accumulated silt alternately wets and dries, especially in summer.
With filtration, some channels are filled with a filter medium to provide filtration (which may remove
dissolved contaminants – Figure 14.4). These may remove dissolved contaminants. Biodegradation
occurs within the filter medium, due to wetting and drying through all seasons, and the effectiveness
depends on the specific properties of the medium. The filter medium can be located in discrete
compartments formed by baffles in the channel to promote vertical water flow through the medium.
The channels require routine maintenance to remove accumulated silt build-up, The frequency is,
however, dependent on specific silt load and the dimensions of the channel it can vary from 6 months to
10 years. They are normally designed so that if silt does build up, it blocks the outlet and water overflows
to adjacent sections of channel over the surface. Thus if maintenance is not carried out the effects
become visible on the surface.
A schematic of one particular type of treatment channel is shown in Figure 14.1 and a photo of the
installation of a similar product is shown in Figure 14.2. This concept can also be incorporated into kerb
drains. Simple treatment channels are shown in Figure 14.3.
Treatment within open channels benefits from sediment ultraviolet light exposure (if the cover lets in
sufficient light) and cyclical sediment wetting and drying, which aid in breaking down pollutants. Dry silts
and sediments are also considerably simpler to remove, as de-watering is not then required.

drodnami or orte searators
Hydrodynamic or vortex separators are vault
structures with a gravity/centrifugal settling or
separation unit to remove medium and large size
sediments. They should not be confused with vortex
flow controls (Chapter 28). The water moves in a
centrifugal (circular) manner from the inlet to the outlet,
thus facilitating the sediment removal process within
a small space. The primary removal mechanism is
sedimentation due to the increased residence time
of water compared to a simple catchpit because the
helical path from entrance to outlet is much longer
than the straight distance between them (Figure 14.4).
The circular movement also creates a vertical vortex
(like a vertical whirlpool) in which the centrifugal forces
created by the circular motion cause suspended
particles to move to the centre of the device. Velocities
here are lower and they settle down to a sump at the
bottom. They can either be designed to accommodate
the full flow to be conveyed downstream, or can be
installed downstream of a bypass structure, so that
high flows are routed around the device. Typical
layouts are shown in Figures 14.5 and 14.6.

separator (from NJCAT, 2005)

Chapter 14: Proprietary treatment systems
275
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Figure 1.6 Hydrodynamic separator with an internal (or integral) bypass (courtesy Hydro International)
Vortex separators are most effective where the materials to be removed from runoff are able to be settled,
or floatables (which can be captured). They cannot remove small diameter solids (eg 115 m) with poor
settleability, emulsions or dissolved pollutants. Note that the removal of settleable particles is dependent
on residence time and therefore flow rate. Reducing flow rates into a device increases residence time and
enables removal of particles with longer settling times.
If the facility does not have a bypass for events exceeding the water quality event, it should be sied to
accommodate the peak flow of the maximum design event likely to be conveyed by the surface water
management system. A check should also be made that the stated removal performance is applicable
for events up to and including the design water quality event, as described in Section 4.3.2 (rather than
the design conveyance event for which pollutant removal will be less of a concern). Where a bypass is
provided, the facility should be sied to accommodate all events up to and including the design water
quality event.
There is a wide variety of proprietary vortex separator units which vary considerably with respect to
geometry and the inclusion of radial baffles and internal circular chambers. As well as the standard units,
some manufacturers offer supplementary features to reduce the velocity of the flow entering the system
(thus increasing the efficiency by allowing more sediment to settle out), reducing turbulence or improving
performance by the inclusion of static separator screens. The units are generally prefabricated as a range
of standard units, but they can often be customised for a specific site if required.
The various types of vortex separator have been placed into subcategories by the USEPA (1999). These
are as follows
Simple vortex separators these rely on a rotating flow field induced in the device to cause enhanced
gravitational settlement of solids in runoff. The rotating flow results in a longer flow path and extended
residence time for particles, and thus settlement of a greater sie range of particles occurs.
Advanced vortex separators these operate in a similar manner to simple vortex separators but they
have internal components to control and enhance separation performance and provide isolated zones for
captured sediments to prevent resuspension and washout under peak flow conditions (see an example
schematic in Figure 14.7).

CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Figure 1.7 Typical schematic of a hydrodynamic separator unit (courtesy Hydro International)
Hydrodynamic separators need routine maintenance to ensure continuing proper operation and sediment
removal efficiencies. They are usually underground, so malfunctioning is not easy to detect and therefore
often ignored (although they can have alarms fitted to warn when cleaning is necessary). This can cause
poor outflow water quality due to resuspension of solids and anaerobic conditions developing within the
device. However, once the sediment accumulation has been observed over the first year of operation the
maintenance intervals can be more accurately predicted and included in site Maintenance Plans.
Hydrodynamic systems such as these typically consist of a standard concrete manhole with internal
components made from either polypropylene or stainless steel. The service life will depend on a number
of factors including the operational life of the internal components and the long-term structural integrity
of the system and its chamber. With routine maintenance, they should typically function effectively for a
period in excess of 40 years.
Further information on vortex separators is provided in HA (201).
rorietar fitration sstems
Filter systems work by routing surface water runoff through the filtering or sorbing medium, which traps
particulates and/or soluble pollutants. They are particularly useful for removing small particles that
may bypass any single gravitational process, and some more advanced filters will remove dissolved
constituents that pass through simple mechanical filtration. Filter-based SuDS often combine simple
filtration with molecular level chemical processes to efficiently capture contaminants.
Proprietary filtration systems for treating surface water runoff have evolved from conventional sand filter
systems and are used more widely in the USA than in the UK. During the early stages of development,
a leaf compost medium was used in fixed beds, replacing the original sand content. More recently
developed systems usually hold filter media in cartridges and a wide array of filter media are available
Chapter 14: Proprietary treatment systems
277
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
including leaf compost, pleated fabric, cellulose, activated charcoal, perlite, amended sand and perlite
and eolite. Filter materials are continuously being developed to address common issues such as re-
entrainment due to salt mobilisation.
Consideration should be given to the physical design of such products. Online systems should be
designed to treat the water quality event and be able to accommodate the peak conveyance flows. Offline
systems should be sied to treat the water quality event. Sediment loading will tend to clog filters, so they
should be designed to minimise this and cleaning and replacement should be practicable. The frequency
of filter replacement will vary depending on the site and filter system used. In some cases, yearly
replacement of filters has proved necessary. Furthermore, the filter medium should be tested for clogging
(colmatation) characteristics. Peak loads go hand in hand with shorter contact times, and it is important
that peak flow performance is understood as well as the contrasting low flow regime.
Filtration systems can be purchased as prefabricated standard units or custom-made to suit site
conditions. Some of the components on the market combine vortex separation and on-line filtration in one
system (Figure 14.9). All events are treated by the vortex separator, with the filter then treating all flows
up to the water quality treatment event. Excess flow will bypass the filter medium beneath the filter bed,
thus avoiding the need for external diversion chambers.
The filters are usually contained in concrete manhole rings or bespoke chambers. Filters may need
vertical space to allow gravity to pass the flow through the medium. In such cases this influences the
invert levels of the incoming and outgoing pipes. It is also important to consider backflow events when the
outlet could be submerged or surcharged.
Filters need routine maintenance to ensure continuing proper operation. They are usually hidden beneath
the ground, and malfunctioning is not easy to detect and therefore is often ignored. This can cause
poor outflow water quality due to resuspension of solids or clogging, resulting in flows bypassing filters
within the device. A major consideration is the availability of bespoke filter cartridges in the future if the
manufacturer ceases trading or discontinues production.

14.2.5 Oil separators
Oil/water (or gravity) separators are widely used to prevent haardous chemical and petroleum products
from entering watercourses and public sewers. They should be installed close to the potential pollution
source to minimise emulsification of oils and their coating of sediments. An example of a large oil/water
separator under construction is shown in Figure 14.9.
Separator designs are almost all based on the principle of separation by flotation, residence time and
particle density and sie. Globules of lower density oil or grease (LNAPLs) in clean non-turbulent water
will rise due to buoyancy. The extent of particle displacement depends on the residence time. Once on the
surface, they can be effectively removed by skimming, pumping etc. Gravity separators cannot be used for
the removal of dissolved or emulsified oils and pollutants, such as coolants, soluble lubricants, glycols and
alcohols. Since resuspension of accumulated sediments is possible during heavy storm events, separator
units are typically installed offline.
Gravity separators are available as prefabricated proprietary systems, but can also be built in situ.
The facilities should comply with BS EN 5-12002. Guidance is also provided in Pollution Prevention
Guidelines (PPG) (EA/SEPA/EHSNI, 2006). The design criteria and specifications of a proprietary
gravity separator unit should always be obtained from the manufacturer.
Compared to other SuDS, these facilities rely heavily on frequent routine maintenance to prevent
pollution. If this does not occur, experience shows that they quickly start to convey pollution downstream.
They are usually hidden beneath the ground, and pollution that is trapped in the system is not obvious
and can contribute to the deterioration of
downstream water quality if allowed to accumulate.
This can be mitigated to some extent by the
incorporation of automatic monitors, as required
by the British Standard. However, the monitors do
need to be linked to a location that is clearly visible
by the site management team when it alarms.
The polluted runoff may also become visible in
the outfall to any surface features, which will give
warning that maintenance is required.
There are two classes of systems. A Class 1 device
means the resultant effluent should contain 5 mg/l
hydrocarbon content or less under standard test
conditions. Class 2 devices can contain up to 100
mg/l in their discharge and are appropriate where
drainage is to a foul sewer. It should be noted that
these are the test requirements; in practice the
effluent may not meet these standards.
Within the two classes are two types based on
incoming and outgoing flow control full retention or
bypass separators. A full retention unit is designed to
treat all the incoming flows to the designated class.
Bypass separators are limited in treating events up to
a certain flow rate, after which flows are bypassed to
the receiving drainage system.
Figure 1.9 Large oil separator under construction
(courtesy ACO Limited)
Guidance on the selection of oil separators is provided in PPG (EA/SEPA/EHSNI, 2006).
Oil/water separators used in the drainage industry usually take the form of a chamber or number of
chambers situated within a drainage system to collect hydrocarbon pollutants. The majority of in situ
separators are formed in concrete. Prefabricated units are generally manufactured in glass-reinforced
plastic, polyethylene, steel or concrete. Systems should be watertight and designed to prevent flotation
where there is a risk of high groundwater levels.
Chapter 14: Proprietary treatment systems
279
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Oil separators are designed for a specific flow rate, unlike most other structural controls, which are sied
on the basis of capturing and treating a specific volume. The separation chamber should provide for three
separate storage volumes
a volume for separated oil storage at the top of the chamber
a volume for settleable solids accumulation at the bottom of the chamber
a volume required to give adequate on-line detention time for separation of oil and sediment from the
surface water runoff
A basic approach to siing separators is set out in PPG (EA/SEPA/EHSNI, 2006).
Figures 14.10 and 14.11 show schematics of prefabricated single and multi-chamber separators.
A typical gravity separator unit may be enhanced with a pre-treatment vortex separation chamber,
oil draw-off devices that continuously remove the accumulated light liquids, and flow control valves
regulating the flow rate into the unit. Plate separators provide alternative options designed to induce
laminar flow conditions through a series of parallel plates. They are generally designed to treat low flow
rates only, but can achieve high pollutant removal efficiencies.

Many proprietary products will use a combination of
processes to effect treatment, often within one element
or unit. In the example shown in Figure 14.12, larger
particulates settle or float while smaller particles,
emulsions and dissolved constituents are captured by
the filter medium.
Some systems provide a combination of different
treatment processes within a single proprietary
system. These types of system will be able to remove
a wider range of pollutants than a device based on one
single process.
14.3 SELECTION AND SITING OF PROPRIETARY
TREATMENT SYSTEMS
The choice of proprietary treatment system will be
dependent on the following aspects of the SuDS
design
Figure 14.12 Multi-process system
Space Where an above-ground SuDS Management Train can be delivered within the available
landscape space and meet any other constraints (including client requirements), using below-ground
proprietary systems may add to the capital and maintenance costs. Where sites are constrained
or surface systems are precluded for other reasons (eg when retrofitting existing sites), the use of
subsurface proprietary systems tends to become more cost effective.
Access to the device/system is important for maintenance and management and should play a role
in siting.
Type of pollutants to be removed Proprietary systems should be selected with pollutant removal
capabilities that match the range and concentrations of pollutants that may be present in runoff from
the site.
ane of o eents for i ontaminant remoal is esire – Proprietary systems should
be selected with specified pollutant removal efficiencies for events up to and including the design
water quality event (Section 4.3.2) for the catchment area draining to the system (for both online and
offline systems). Online systems should have sufficient capacity to manage the maximum design
flow through the system without significant re-entrainment of pollution, and offline systems should
manage this flow via a suitably sied bypass.
Chapter 14: Proprietary treatment systems
281
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
The systems should be designed to be as shallow as possible but can often be located under roads, car
parks and open space. There are instances where the use of proprietary SuDS can increase the length of
time between maintenance for other components, and as a result can lower overall maintenance liability.
14.4 HYDRAULIC DESIGN
14.4.1 General
Proprietary treatment systems should be designed so that the runoff rates and volumes to them are within
the stated performance envelope for the particular system, throughout its intended service life. Care is
required to ensure that flows from larger rainfall events can be managed by the units without significant
resuspension of sediment or other pollutants. If this cannot be guaranteed then larger flows will need to
be diverted around the systems.
nteretion desin
Proprietary treatment systems do not generally provide Interception (except for proprietary bioretention
systems, if designed to drain small catchment areas).
ea o ontro desin
Proprietary treatment systems do not generally provide peak flow control.
oume ontro desin
Proprietary treatment systems do not generally provide volume control.
eedane o desin
Proprietary treatment systems should be designed so that runoff rates and volumes that exceed the stated
system performance envelope are routed to the next part of the drainage system along safe exceedance
flow paths. Because these systems can store large concentrated volumes of free pollutants, it may be
necessary to consider their operation in flood situations where surcharging etc can backwash pollutants out
of a system.
Guidance on exceedance design is provided in Section 24.12.
14.5 TREATMENT DESIGN
Proprietary treatment systems include a wide variety of designs and component types that can provide
a range of treatment processes as described in Section 14.2 (biological filtration, filtration, adsorption,
physical removal of sediment by settling, removal of floatables or a combination of processes). Wetting
and drying of sediment also promotes degradation of organic pollutants. The ability of a specific device
to remove particular pollutants from surface water runoff is related to the treatment processes it supports
and the nature of pollutants as well as pollutant loading rates.
The sie and density of sediment will influence sedimentation and filtration. Large diameter sand
particles are much easier to capture than suspended clay colloidal particles and extremely small colloidal
particles may be subject to Brownian movement and remain suspended indefinitely (although it is worth
remembering that SuDS are not trying to remove all pollution from runoff, so in practice this may not be
an issue). The smaller the particle sie the more likely it is that some form of filtration may be required
to remove it. It is preferable to avoid oils emulsifying in the first place by avoiding large flows of turbulent
water (ie use proprietary systems that are source control systems). If oils do become emulsified they will
require filtration to remove them. Dissolved pollutants (inc and copper are commonly in dissolved form in
runoff) may require adsorptive filtration or precipitation to be effectively removed.
282 Part D: Technical detail
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Therefore, in a similar manner to any SuDS component, these systems should be part of an overall
Management Train (Chapter 4). Their contribution to meeting the objectives of the required treatment
strategy at any particular site should be demonstrated with respect to the type of contaminants that are
managed by the system and the likely performance level. Justification should be provided regarding the
level of mitigation assumed for any product (Chapter 26, Tables 26.3 and 26.4). Evidence of the potential
efficiency of components that use different process types is presented in Chapter 26, Annex 3. However,
these should not be assumed to be delivered by a proposed component without appropriate supporting
evidence. Also, meeting existing standards is not adequate justification in itself, without evaluating the
standards requirements in the light of the treatment methodology set out in this manual.
Manufacturers should provide clear guidance on how to design their specific system to meet the stated
performance envelope. They should state the pollution removal performance for each contaminant at a range of
flow rates, and these should be used in determining catchment areas for the upstream drainage system.
The treatment performance of proprietary systems in the field tends to be as variable as more traditional
SuDS such as swales or basins and can be dependent on a wide range of factors including the
characteristics of the contaminants present in the runoff, the treatment process type(s) employed by
the system, the influent concentrations, the inflow rate and the maintenance history. There may also be
an observed decline in performance of some systems during cold weather (those that are dependent
largely on particle settling time because the changes in water temperature affect the settling velocity
of particles). Some manufacturers make claims of guaranteed performance, but such claims should be
treated with caution (as they should be from designers of non-proprietary systems) unless supported
by evidence from independent third parties (the evidence is that they are just as variable as other SuDS
when placed in real situations outside the laboratory).
Because all systems are different, it is important that evidence is provided to support any performance
claims. In the UK, there are currently no standardised testing methods or reporting protocols for
proprietary surface water runoff treatment products. However, it is recommended that all testing is
undertaken by organisations that are independent of the manufacturer in order to ensure that any
performance claims are supported by robust evidence using appropriate test methods that may include
field trials to demonstrate real-world performance. If not, the testing and results should be peer-reviewed
by an independent third party. There are internationally available standard tests that can be completed
(eg State of Washington, 2011, State of New Jersey, 201, DIBt, 2011, and Dierkes et al, 201) to allow
the publication of performance data.
DIBt (2011) is widely used in Europe, and there are treatment channels and filter systems that meet the
requirements of this standard. The standards used in the Netherlands and produced by Kiwa are very
similar to the DIBt standard.
There is also a UK test protocol under preparation at the time of writing by British Water, and this will
detail a test procedure that UK manufacturers can undertake, with independent witnessing.
Any performance testing should take account of the following recommendations
Testing should be undertaken over a representative range of rainfall events that are applicable to the
design and operation of the system. The main interest is the performance for events up to a 11 year
and the risk of resuspension during larger events due to turbulence if the system is designed to be
on line. Laboratory test data should cover design flows into the system for a range of representative
rainfall events to at least a 11 year event. Greater flow rates than the design event for water quality
should also be tested to assess resuspension in on-line systems.
Sediment loads and the particle sie distribution is very important and has a significant influence on
the estimated performance. Tests should use particle sizes that are representative of the range of sizes
likely to be present in sediment in runoff with particular importance given to those 6 m Particle
sie ranges are especially important when testing the effectiveness of hydrodynamic separators, and
the larger the average particle sie used for evaluation, the higher the treatment efficiency. The specific
gravity and grading of the particles used in any assessment should be clearly stated and compared
with the site-specific design requirements.
Chapter 14: Proprietary treatment systems
283
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Measurements of particle sie distribution should be included in any sampling and analysis
programme, to assess the removal efficiency of total suspended solids, as well as that of other
contaminants associated with various particle size fractions. There is a higher concentration of
pollutants in the smaller particle sies ( 6 m), but when examining the mass distribution of the
pollutants, particle sies greater than 6 m may, in some instances, be of equal concern.
If field sampling is carried out, the effects of supernatant displacement and active-particle removal
by the system (ie hydrostatic versus hydrodynamic separation) should be differentiated. This requires
flow-proportional sampling throughout each storm event.
If field testing is carried out, account should be taken of antecedent conditions, bypass flows and
resuspension when estimating the performance of the system.
A sufficient number of storms should be sampled if field tests are undertaken, not only to obtain
statistically significant data, but also to include as wide a range as possible of operating conditions
to which the device will be subject. In the USA, there is a phased approach to certification of
proprietary systems whereby limited use is allowed based on laboratory tests to allow field data to be
collected. This avoids stifling innovation.
Treatment performance should be analysed by considering the total load of pollution which is the
preferable method for accuracy and quality control.
Storms should be sampled sequentially, to allow for a mass-balance evaluation.
Testing and monitoring should be relevant to the pollutants intended for removal by the device.
14.6 AMENITY DESIGN
With the exception of biofiltration systems with vegetation, proprietary systems do not provide direct amenity
benefits, but amenity features can often be implemented on the overlying surface, such as parks. They
can also facilitate amenity provision in downstream surface features by delivering clean water. Biofiltration
systems with vegetation should be designed to deliver amenity in accordance with Chapter 18.
14.7 BIODIVERSITY DESIGN
With the exception of biofiltration systems with vegetation, proprietary systems do not provide biodiversity
benefits. They can facilitate biodiversity provision in downstream surface features by delivering clean
water to those features. Biofiltration systems with vegetation should be designed to deliver biodiversity in
accordance with Chapter 18.
14.8 PHYSICAL SPECIFICATIONS
The specification of proprietary devices will be based on manufacturers’ information. This should include
all relevant information that is required to ensure that the system meets the claimed performance. The
specification should include the flow rates over which the claimed performance can be achieved and the
range of pollutants that the system can remove. For TSS removal, the particle sie and density which the
system can effectively remove at a range of flow rates should be stated.
retreatment and inets
Proprietary systems either have their own specific inlet details or they will be fed by gullies, normal
drainage systems or proprietary inlets which may provide some pre-treatment, if designed as such.
Manufacturers’ literature should be consulted for details of required inlets for specific devices. The
maintenance requirements for any pre-treatment elements should be stated by the manufacturer, as this
will have an impact on the performance of the downstream proprietary treatment system.
284 Part D: Technical detail
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
utets
Specific required outlet details should be provided by the manufacturer of the device.
14.9 MATERIALS
The main material that will be specific to a proprietary device will be the bespoke filter medium. The
manufacturer should provide the specification for any bespoke filter medium if applicable, including
base material
particle sie distribution (grading)
salt content
permeability
organic matter content
pH
electrical conductivity
phosphorous content
suppliers of the filter medium.
Filter media should be easily accessible for replacement, and the full specification of any cartridges
should also be provided so that they can be replaced. By providing this information, there is less risk of
not being able to replace the filter medium if the manufacturer of the device goes out of business, which
has been a problem on some sites in the USA. If the filter medium is subject to intellectual property rights
or there is competitive advantage in using a specific material then a statement that the filter medium
specification will be made available or available for acquisition under intellectual property sale should
be sufficient to ensure continuity of supply if the manufacturer ceases trading.
Material choice for the components and chambers will affect the anticipated asset lifetime. The functional
performance of the device in terms of treatment should not be considered in isolation, and the long-term
structural integrity, environmental impact and whole life value of the asset need to be taken into account.
14.10 LANDSCAPE DESIGN AND PLANTING
There are no landscape and vegetation requirements for most proprietary systems. For manufactured
bioretention systems and tree pits, the advice in Chapters 18 and 19 should be followed.
14.11 CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS
Where units are prefabricated, construction concerns generally relate to
1 compaction of foundations to ensure that uneven settling will not occur
2 quality control of foundation levels to ensure that inflow and outflow pipes are at the correct elevation.
Particular attention should be paid to manufacturers’ information in respect of backfilling and ballasting.
Further detail on construction activities and the programming of construction activities is provided in
Chapter 31.
Generic health and safety guidance is presented in Chapter 36.
Chapter 14: Proprietary treatment systems
285
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
A construction phase health and safety plan is required under the Construction (Design and
Management) Regulations (CDM) 2015. This should ensure that all construction risks have been
identified, eliminated, reduced and/or controlled where appropriate.
Manufacturers should provide advice on whether the treatment systems need to be protected from
construction phase runoff, and how this can best be achieved.
14.12 OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS
enera uidane
Proprietary treatment systems will require routine maintenance to ensure continuing operation to
design performance standards. Because of the wide range of different designs and performance, all
manufacturers should provide detailed specifications and frequencies for the required maintenance
activities along with likely machinery requirements and typical annual costs for any given site. The
treatment performance of proprietary systems is strongly dependent on maintenance, and robust
management plans will be required to ensure that maintenance is carried out in the long term. There
are examples where not undertaking maintenance has led to pollution, and the companies involved
have been fined. The cost of maintenance would have been much less than the subsequent fine and
clean-up costs. Different proprietary treatment devices will have different operation and maintenance
requirements, but this section gives some generic guidance. Ease of access for maintenance and
inspection is essential. In particular, access lids and covers should be kept as lightweight as practicable.
Many proprietary systems are beneath the ground, and malfunctioning is not easy to detect, and it is
therefore often ignored unless alarms are provided or the system is designed to cause localised surface
ponding if full. If systems lead to other surface features, early warning of maintenance being required
may be easily observed at the inlet to the feature (which should be designed to prevent it entering the
main part of the component). Preference should be given to systems or designs that give some easily
observable indication that maintenance is required.
Lack of routine maintenance is more likely to cause poor outflow water quality than with other SuDS due
to resuspension of solids and anaerobic conditions developing within the device. For example, anaerobic
conditions can develop in deep sumps and catchpits that result in nutrients and metals being released
from captured sediments. During the first few months after installation, subsurface treatment units should
be visually inspected after rainfall events, and the amount of deposition measured to give the operator
an idea of the expected rate of sediment and oil deposition. After this initial period, systems should be
inspected every six months to verify the appropriate level of maintenance. During these inspections, the
floating debris and any floating oils should normally be removed. This may be done using a van-mounted
system, without the need for a large tanker. Silt should be removed when it reaches 75 of the capacity
of the sump. In most situations, the units should be fully cleaned out at least annually. If there is a
significant spill of oil (or other pollutant) the system should be cleaned immediately.
Hilliges et al (201) recommends cleaning treatment channels out every six months, in spring and after
the summer. This was based on observed silt build up for a busy road (AADT 57 000 vehicles per day)
and this frequency could possibly be reduced in less trafficked areas. Experience with other channels in
less trafficked areas shows silt removal may only be required every 10 years.
Proper disposal of oil, solids and floating debris removed from components must be ensured, and
the environmental regulator should be approached for advice where there are any doubts concerning
disposal options. A small portion of water will be removed along with the pollutants during the clean-out
process, which should be considered when costing sediment disposal processes.
Further guidance on waste management is given in Chapter 33.
Harmful vapours may develop in subsurface filtration or hydrodynamic separation units, as hydrocarbons
may remain there for extended periods of time. Appropriate testing for harmful vapours and venting

It is usually a requirement that separators are filled with clean water before being put into operation and
each time after emptying for maintenance. Failure to do so will cause the separator to malfunction until
surface water builds up the required permanent water level in the facility. It is possible to fit an alarm to
separators that will indicate when the collected oil volume is at a maximum, and this may be a regulatory
requirement. The alarms should be placed in a location that is clearly visible to those responsible for
maintenance of the system.

15Chapter Filter strips
his chapter provides guidance on the design of filter strips vegetated
areas of gently sloping ground designed to drain runoff evenly from
impermeable areas filtering out silt and other particulates
Appendix Section demonstrates how to design a filter strip for an industrial area
15.1 GENERAL DESCRIPTION
Filter strips (Figure 15.1) are uniformly graded and gently sloping strips of grass or
other dense vegetation that are designed to treat runoff from adjacent impermeable
areas by promoting sedimentation, filtration and infiltration (where acceptable).
The runoff is designed to flow as a sheet across the filter strip at sufficiently low
velocities that treatment processes can take place effectively. They are often used as
either a pre-treatment component before swales, bioretention systems and trenches
(to extend the life of these components by capturing sediment) or as a treatment
component (where the flow path length across the strip is sufficient).
At low to moderate velocities, filter strips effectively reduce particulate pollutant levels
by removing sediments, organic materials and heavy metals. Settling-out of sediment
that contains clay particles also removes absorbed nutrients and other pollutants.
Some removal of free soluble pollutants in filter strips is accomplished when pollutants
infiltrate into the soil, where they are subsequently taken up by rooted vegetation.
Where infiltration is possible and permitted, its extent tends to be limited during intense
storms as only a small proportion of the runoff is lost (the initial loss), but where there
is some subsoil permeability it will be the dominant mechanism for small rainfall events,
and filter strips can therefore contribute effectively to the delivery of Interception.

Figure 15.2 Filter strip schematic
15.2 GENERAL DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS
The contributing drainage area should have a shallow slope that falls towards the filter strip. There
should not normally be any other surface gradient as filter strips require consistent sheet inflow to ensure
performance, although with careful design level spreaders can be used to accommodate small changes
in longitudinal slopes. The filter strip should extend the entire length of the area that is being drained.
While filter strips are a simple technology, good design requires attention to detail. Key issues that cause
failure of filter strips include
clogging at the impervious surface/vegetation interface disturbing sheet flow
inappropriate landscaping, for example lack of drop from edge of hard surface, inaccurate grading
creating erosion and ponding conditions.
Filter strip design requirements are principally aimed at delivering water quality benefits (particularly
prevention of sediment from damaging the performance of downstream components) and the filter strip
performance will be strongly dependent on its length (in the direction of flow).
Filter strips will allow only low levels of infiltration so, provided that the soils between the filter strip and
the groundwater provide adequate groundwater protection, and the filter strip soil has appropriate organic
and clay content, then pollution risks to groundwater should usually be acceptable provided that the
area is not a high haard site. However, this should always be checked by following the requirements
of Table 4.3 in Chapter 4 and the design methods set out in Chapter 26. Where the sensitivity or
vulnerability of the underlying groundwater means that infiltration should be prevented, filter strips can be
designed above an impermeable geomembrane liner at a depth of at least 0.5 m, although risks of poor
construction and waterlogging should be considered.
The acceptability of infiltration from the filter strip should be determined by following the guidance
provided in Section 25.2, complying with all relevant requirements for infiltration systems with respect to
ground stability, depth to water table etc and Section 26.7 with respect to the protection of groundwater.
The maximum likely groundwater level should always be at least 1 m below the lowest level of the filter
strip, where infiltration can occur.
Health and safety risk management design guidance is presented in Chapter 36.
292 Part D: Technical detail
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
15.3 SELECTION AND SITING OF FILTER STRIPS
Filter strips can be used in a variety of situations but are particularly well suited for managing runoff
from roads because they are a linear feature and easily incorporated into roadside space. They are also
suitable for managing runoff from car parks and other impermeable and permeable areas. Filter strips
should be effectively incorporated into landscaping and public open spaces, so that their function is not
compromised by activity in the area (eg damage from parking or pedestrians).
They are useful on industrial sites because any visible pollution can be identified, the source traced, the
contamination removed as far as possible and the strip rehabilitated relatively easily.
Unlined filter strips should not be used on brownfield sites unless it has been demonstrated clearly that
the risk posed by leaching of contaminants is managed to acceptable levels. Unlined filter strips should
not be used to treat runoff from areas with high contaminant loads if the risk of groundwater pollution
due to infiltration is unacceptably high. Where a liner is used to prevent infiltration, the seasonally high
groundwater level should be below the level of the liner. If infiltration is allowed, the maximum likely
groundwater level should be at least 1 m below the base of the system.
Filter strips should not be located in areas where trees or structures will cause shade conditions that limit
grass growth.
15.4 HYDRAULIC DESIGN
15.4.1 General
Maintaining sheet flow onto the filter strip is essential, and can effectively be achieved through the use of
an appropriate level spreading device, such as a gravel flow spreader (Section 28.4.6).
Filter strips should be designed with a minimum longitudinal slope (ie slope along the direction of flow) of
1 (to prevent ponding) and a maximum slope of 5 to prevent flow channelling. The top and bottom of
the slope should be at the lower end of the allowable slope range to reduce flow velocities and thereby
reduce the risk of erosion. Where filter strip slopes are 5, a series of level spreaders can be used to
maintain sheet flow as runoff flows over the strip.
The maximum length of impervious area draining to filter strips should be controlled in order to reduce
the risk of concentrated flows, although this will also be dependent on the slope of the impermeable area,
and on the effectiveness of adopted flow spreading techniques. Filter strip lengths tend to be determined
by treatment objectives (Section 15.5).
Maximum flow velocities across the filter strip of 1.5 m/s are recommended to prevent erosion during
design flows (note that a lower velocity is required for treatment Section 15.5).
Manning’s equation (Equation 15.1) can be used to design the filter strip for design flow velocities.
15.4.2 Interception design
Where topsoils are suitably permeable, and underlying soils have some capacity to store and/or infiltrate
runoff, then filter strips with very shallow slopes can be designed to deliver Interception (ie reduce or
prevent runoff during small rainfall events). The extent of Interception delivered will be strongly dependent
on filter strip length (see Figure 15.2), which also influences designing for treatment Section 15.5.
Where there is infiltration capacity, infiltration is acceptable and the strip is designed to facilitate even
limited infiltration, then a check should be made to determine whether the strip is able to dispose of 5 mm
rainfall depth over the contributing catchment area.
Where there is no infiltration, but the natural surface soils (or imported/re-engineered soils) have water
storage capacity, then Interception design should follow the principles set out in Section 24.8.
Chapter 15: Filter strips

CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
ea o ontro desin
Sheet flow across filter strips is not usually controlled, and in this situation no reduction in peak flow is
included within design calculations.
To design for the control of low return period events, an impermeable berm could be designed at the
toe of the slope, with piped outlets to control flow rates. Consideration of maintenance requirements,
particularly in terms of pipe blockage, is required to determine whether such an approach is robust for
long-term performance.
15.4.4 Volume control design
Filter strips do not tend to provide significant infiltration during large storm events, so they do not
contribute to volumetric reductions during design storms.
eedane o desin
It is usual for exceedance flows (ie for events larger than the design event) to pass across the filter strip,
and for any resultant damage to be repaired post event. However, if specific protection is required for
downstream components, then a bypass for the strip could be considered.
15.5 TREATMENT DESIGN
Filter strips can help retain runoff from small events on site (ie deliver Interception Section 15.4.2),
helping to reduce the contaminant load discharged to surface waters via volumetric control. They can
also treat the residual runoff by facilitating sedimentation and filtration.
The acceptability of allowing infiltration from the filter strip will depend on the extent of the likely runoff
contamination and site characteristics (see Chapter 4, Table 4.3).
Filter strip lengths 2.5 m (ideally m) are valuable where slopes are constrained to at or near 1
(Claytor and Schueler, 1996), particularly for protecting the functionality of downstream components
(ie as a pre-treatment component) and lengths 5 m have been demonstrated to be very effective in
terms of water quality performance (Barrett et al, 2004) even for steeper slopes, although the density of
vegetation is an important factor. A filter strip study by Caltrans (200) found that when slopes are less
than 10% and the vegetation cover exceeds 80%, then an irreducible concentration is achieved at a strip
length less than 5 m, ie a longer strip is only required where slopes exceed 10. At a 20 slope, it is
suggested that a 1 m length of filter strip should be provided for every 6 m of impermeable area flow path
length (Figure 15.2).
Research has shown consistent removal of total suspended solids and total heavy metals, and frequently
also for dissolved metals where designs conform to the criteria set out above. However, removal
efficiencies are variable, so filter strips should always be used together with downstream treatment
components. Evidence of the removal efficiencies of filter strips is presented in Chapter 26, Annex 3.
Good pollutant removal performance is required for all runoff events up to and including events that
occur, on average, about once a year (termed here the 11 year event). The duration of this event should
be the relevant critical duration for the filter strip flow rate. If the filter strip is draining a road, then 15
minutes is likely to be appropriate. For this water quality design event
the flow depth should be lower than the height of the vegetation and should therefore be limited to
approximately 100 mm depth to maintain good levels of filtration
the peak flow velocity should be lower than 0. m/s to promote particulate settlement
the time of travel of runoff across the filter strip (residence time length/velocity) should be at least 9
minutes.
294 Part D: Technical detail
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
In the past, there have been recommendations that keeping grass short in filter strips and swales
prevents the grass lodging over (ie being pushed over and flattened by the flow of water) and
improves pollution removal. However, the risk of pollution removal being compromised is now
considered to be minimal, and there is no reason for a blanket requirement to keep the grass short in
all swales and filter strips.
Manning’s equation can be used to support the design of the filter strip, as given in Equation 15.1.

n Manning’s n roughness coefficient (m1/s)
Appropriate guidance values for Manning’s “n” are provided in Section 17.4.1.
15.6 AMENITY DESIGN
Filter strips deliver green, vegetated open space adjacent to impermeable areas and should be integrated
with the overall site design and surrounding landscaping.
Where filter strips lie adjacent to roads and car parks, consideration should be given to installing a low-
level, inconspicuous barrier to prevent unauthorised vehicular access onto the filter strip. This should not,
however, impede sheet flow over the strip. Trees (where appropriate Section 15.10), bollards, crash
barriers, slotted kerbs or intermittently spaced boulders can be considered.
Landscaping and layout of the filter strip and its adjacent area should be such that pedestrian traffic
(and cycling) is kept to a minimum. The location of filter strips should be well defined on a site, as their
function and value to the surface water management system is often not obvious to those using the site.
Consideration should be given to the potential need for suitable signage to prevent future redevelopment,
or alteration and reuse, of filter strip areas.
The topsoil on which the filter strip is built should drain well and should be suitable for supporting the
growth of dense vegetation, preferably grass, although other plants can be included within the design for
aesthetic value (Section 15.10).
15.7 BIODIVERSITY DESIGN
A grass strip within the overall site landscaping will support biodiversity by providing
feeding and foraging areas for birds, invertebrates, reptiles and amphibians
habitats for breeding invertebrates
stepping stone habitats in urban areas.
More diverse planting, possibly including areas of wildflowers, will encourage wider biodiversity.
Chapter 15: Filter strips
295
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
15.8 PHYSICAL SPECIFICATIONS
15.8.1 Pre-treatment and inlets
A flow spreading device should normally be included upstream of the filter strip to ensure consistent
lateral inflow along the length of the device. Some of these can also provide some degree of pre-
treatment by trapping sediment upstream of the strip. Flow spreading options include
porous pavement strips
stabilised turf strips
slotted curbing
gravel-filled trenches (with larger stones where the contributing drainage area is steep), and
concrete sills.
There should always be a drop of at least 50 mm from the pavement edge to the filter strip to prevent the
formation of a sediment lip.
All pre-treatment/flow spreading devices should be designed with maintenance considerations in mind.
15.8.2 Outlets
In most situations, the outflow from the filter strip should be routed into a downstream component (eg
swale) for conveyance and further treatment, so no outlet mechanism is required.
15.9 MATERIALS
15.9.1 Level spreaders
Any interim level spreaders should be constructed of durable, non-toxic material graded into the soil
minimum 150 mm wide, 50100 mm high, running along the length of the filter strip.
15.9.2 Subsoils
If subsoils are highly compacted or of such low fertility or soil composition that pore space for water
storage is very low and vegetation is unlikely to become established, the soils should be tilled to 00 mm
and amended to meet the specifications for engineered soils set out in Section 30.4.2.
15.9.3 Geotextiles/geomembranes
Geotextile and geomembrane specifications are presented in Section 30.5.
15.10 LANDSCAPE DESIGN AND PLANTING
The filter strip surface should be planted with an appropriate grass mixture, or turfed. Filter strips
are subject to both wet and dry conditions, as well as sediment and debris accumulation. A mixture
of dry-area and wet-area grasses, able to prevent erosion and capable of growing through any silt
deposits is required. A dense, soil binding, deep rooted vegetation cover is required that will need to
be maintained at lengths of 75150 mm to ensure effective filtration performance during regular events.
Turf provides immediate protection, provided the seams are protected by laying the strips perpendicular
to the flow of water and hand tamping them after laying. A filter strip is best seeded during spring and
early summer months to give vegetation the whole length of a growing season to establish. Longer
grasses and wildflower areas, if considered beneficial for other reasons, are not considered to pose a
significant risk to performance.
296 Part D: Technical detail
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Where filter strips are used to drain runoff from roads or car park areas that are likely to be regularly
salted during winter months, then the planting should be salt tolerant.
Trees and dense scrub should generally be avoided on the filter strip unless the available filter strip flow
path length is significantly greater than required (eg parks and schools where open space areas may
be large). Although they may improve aesthetics, it is difficult to preserve the healthy dense vegetated
ground cover, slope uniformity and stability that are required for a well-functioning filter strip. Where
additional space is available and the risks to filter strip performance have been fully considered, trees can
potentially be used either as traffic barriers or as amenity features.
Filter strips should not be located in shaded areas because sunlight is required to ensure healthy
plant growth.
If a berm is constructed at the toe of the filter strip, the vegetation should be resistant to frequent
inundation within the shallow ponding limit.
Fertilising a filter strip should be avoided if possible, particularly where the receiving environment is
sensitive to nutrient loadings.
Landscape design and planting best practice is presented in detail in Chapter 29.
15.11 CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS
Filter strips should be clearly marked before site work begins and protected by signage and silt fencing, to
avoid their disturbance during construction. No vehicular traffic, except that specifically used to construct
the component, should be allowed close to the filter strip. Excavating equipment should operate from
the side of the filter strip. If compaction of soils does occur, a 00 mm depth of soil should be removed
and replaced with a blend of topsoil and sand to promote infiltration and biological growth or tilled and
enhanced to achieve a similar specification.
The filter strip should be constructed using careful grading techniques to provide an even and consistent
longitudinal slope, with no severe undulations that will cause localised ponding or promote flow in
channels. Even the smallest non-conformities may compromise flow conditions.
A newly constructed filter strip should be protected from surface water flows until vegetation has been
established. This may be achieved by
diverting runoff around the filter strip until vegetation is established
using pre-established turf or seeded mattresses
covering the filter strip with clear plastic until the vegetation is well rooted
placing an erosion control blanket over the freshly applied seed mix.
Ideally filter strips should be planted in the spring, when vegetation can become established with
minimum irrigation needs. If more than 0 of the treatment area is bare after four weeks, reseeding or
replanting will be required to achieve 90 coverage.
If sediment from construction work accumulates on a filter strip, it should be cleared and the strip fully
rehabilitated before the drainage system is adopted by the organisation carrying out the maintenance.

Chapter 31.

A construction phase health and safety plan is required under the Construction (Design and
Management) Regulations (CDM) 2015. This should ensure that all construction risks have been
identified, eliminated, reduced and/or controlled where appropriate.
15.12 OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS
Filter strips will require regular maintenance to ensure continuing operation to design performance standards,
and all designers should provide detailed specifications and frequencies for the required maintenance
activities along with likely machinery requirements and typical annual costs within the Maintenance Plan.
The treatment performance of filter strips is dependent on maintenance, and robust management plans will
be required to ensure that maintenance is carried out in the long term. Different designs will have different
operation and maintenance requirements, but this section gives some generic guidance.
Maintenance of filter strips is relatively straightforward for landscape contractors and typically there
should only be a small amount of extra work (if any) required for a filter strip over and above what is
necessary for standard public open space. Providing landscape management is already required at site,
filter strip maintenance should therefore have marginal cost implications. However, regular inspection
and maintenance is important for the effective operation of filter strips as designed. Maintenance
responsibility for a filter strip should always be placed with an appropriate organisation. If filter strips are
implemented within private property, owners should be educated on their routine maintenance needs, and
should understand the long-term Maintenance Plan and any legally binding maintenance agreement.
Access for maintenance vehicles should always be available. However, this is not usually a constraint
due to the likely location of the filter strip adjacent to impermeable areas. Litter and debris removal
should be undertaken as part of general landscape maintenance for the site and before any other SuDS
management task. All litter should be removed from site.
The major maintenance requirement for filter strips is mowing. This should ideally retain grass lengths of
75150 mm across the main treatment surface to assist in filtering pollutants and retaining sediments
and to reduce the risk of flattening during runoff events. However, longer vegetation lengths, where
appropriate, are not considered to pose a significant risk to functionality.
Grass clippings should be disposed of either off site or outside the area of the filter strip to remove
nutrients and pollutants. All vegetation management activities should take account of the need to
maximise biosecurity and prevent the spread of invasive species.
Occasionally, sediment will need to be removed (eg once deposits exceed 25 mm in depth), although this
can be minimised by ensuring that upstream areas are fully stabilised in advance. Available evidence
from monitoring studies indicates that small distributed infiltration practices such as filter strips do not
contaminate underlying soils, even after more than 10 years of operation (TRCA, 200). Sediments
excavated from a filter strip that receives runoff from residential or standard road and roof areas are
generally not of toxic or hazardous material and can therefore be safely disposed of by either land
application or landfilling. However, consultation should take place with the environmental regulator to
confirm appropriate protocols. Sediment testing may be required before sediment excavation to determine
its classification and appropriate disposal methods. For runoff from streets with high vehicle traffic,
sediment testing will be essential. In the majority of cases, it will be acceptable to distribute the sediment
on site if there is an appropriate safe and acceptable location to do so.
Any damage due to sediment removal or erosion should be repaired and immediately reseeded or planted.
Further detail on waste management is provided in Chapter 32.

appropriate. The list of actions is not exhaustive and some actions may not always be required.

reduced and/or controlled where appropriate. This information will be required as part of the health and
safety file.

16Chapter Filter drains
his chapter provides guidance on the design of filter drains linear
drains consisting of a trench filled with a permeable aggregate material
often with a perforated pipe in the base of the trench to assist drainage
Appendix Section demonstrates how to design a filter drain for an industrial area
16.1 GENERAL DESCRIPTION
Filter drains are shallow trenches filled with stone/gravel that create temporary
subsurface storage for the attenuation, conveyance and filtration of surface water
runoff. The stone may be contained in a simple trench lined with a geotextile,
geomembrane or other impermeable liner, or within a more structural facility such
as a concrete trough. Filter drains may be lined (if required) or may allow infiltration
depending on the suitability of the underlying soils and the protection they afford to the
groundwater (Sections 25.2 and 26.7).
Filter drains should ideally receive lateral inflow from an adjacent impermeable surface
that is pre-treated using a vegetated filter strip or equivalent. They are not normally
intended to function as sediment traps and should be implemented downstream of
a pre-treatment system in order to prevent clogging and failure. Where there is no
effective upstream removal of sediments and silts, a geotextile (or other effective
filtration) layer below the filter drain surface, at a shallow depth, is required that can be
regularly removed and cleaned or replaced.
Filter drains can help reduce pollutant levels in runoff by filtering out fine sediments,
metals, hydrocarbons and other pollutants. They can also encourage adsorption and
biodegradation processes. With adequate structural protection, geocellular products
can be used as an alternative to some of the stone where the component is designed
principally for conveyance: they have a higher void ratio but limited treatment capacity,
and are often used to provide additional storage ones for high return period flow events
in conjunction with other treatment components or gravel layers in the trench.
Filter drains are on-line features, and designers should therefore take full consideration
of the inflow rates and volumes potentially associated with high return period events,
ensuring that the trench is adequately protected from damage, and excess flows can be
conveyed safely downstream.
A perforated pipe should be provided near the base of the filter drain to collect and
convey water to downstream drainage components. Use of the available attenuation
storage provided by the voids in the aggregate fill can be maximised through the use
of downstream flow control systems. A high-level perforated pipe can be installed to
provide an overflow for flows in excess of the design event. Where a network of filter
drains is established, high-level pipes can be used to transfer excess waters around the
system in the event of local overloading.
Filter drains can replace conventional pipework as conveyance systems, and the use of
adjacent filter strips or flow spreaders can remove the need for kerbs and gullies when
systems are located adjacent to roads or highways. They work best when incorporated
into a treatment train, and should be used in conjunction with other SuDS components
to safely pass and store extreme storm flows.

An example cross section for a filter drain is given in Figure 16.2. The upper sacrificial stone layer may
only be required where upstream sediment removal is considered insufficient.
Figure 16.2 Filter drain schematic
16.2 GENERAL DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS
Filter drain depths should generally be 12 m. The minimum depth of filter medium beneath any inflow
distribution pipework and outfall collection systems should be 0.5 m to ensure reasonable levels of
pollutant removal (Hatt et al, 2007). Where infiltration is allowed, the maximum groundwater level should
be at least 1 m below the base of the trench. Where filter drains are implemented adjacent to roads,
guidance on gradients and distances to carriageway centrelines are set out in Chapter 9. Filter drain
widths will tend to be dictated by the flows to be accommodated by the component and the diameter of
any embedded pipe (eg a 150 mm diameter pipe would require 150 mm width bedding surround, giving a
total filter drain width of 50 mm).
304 Part D: Technical detail
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
The voids ratio and permeability of the granular fill should be sufficiently high to allow adequate percolation
and to control the risk of blockage. Consideration should be given as to whether the trench is required to
withstand surface loadings such as vehicular traffic, as this will influence the type of fill that will be suitable.
The structural requirements of geocellular systems (which may be specified for enhanced storage or
conveyance purposes beneath the stone layer) are described in detail in Chapter 21. Such systems should
be below the minimum 0.5 m depth required for adequate pollutant removal or else additional downstream
(or upstream) treatment will usually be required. Where perforated pipes are used as distribution or
collection systems, they should be set within appropriate depths of pipe bedding material. Perforated pipes
require a sufficient area of openings to manage the expected flow rate of water into and out of the pipes.
The most effective pre-treatment option for filter drains is to have runoff flow over a small filter strip
between the edge of the drained area and the trench. Even a 0.5 m wide strip of grass can remove
a significant amount of silt and prolong the time until the drain needs to be cleaned/rehabilitated. An
enhanced filter layer or geotextile can be used at a high level in the trench to provide pre-treatment where
other pre-treatment options are not practicable. However, this should only be used where inspection and
maintenance regimes are regular and robust, as the system will tend to clog rapidly. Also, the layer should
be readily separable from the side sections as it will require regular replacement. The filter drain should
only drain small areas if this form of pre-treatment is adopted.
Appropriate geotextile and geomembrane specifications are described in the Chapter 30.
The main cause of damage to filter drains is vehicles running off the carriageway and scattering the filter
material. This can cause a hazard to vehicles on the carriageway, and barriers such as bollards, large
rocks or low railings should be used to prevent traffic from running on, or parking on, the filter drain.
For all filter drains, any lengths of perforated pipes that are more than 10 m should be spaced between
access sumps (also known as catchpits) so that the pipes can be cleaned by jetting out or rodding (these
sumps can be up to 90 m apart for longer runs of trench). Access sumps should always be accessible
and clearly identifiable.
Health and safety risk management design guidance is provided in Chapter 36.
16.3 SELECTION AND SITING OF FILTER DRAINS
Filter drains are best located adjacent to impermeable surfaces such as car parks or roads/highways with
upstream pre-treatment systems. They can be used for draining residential and non-residential runoff
and, when lined, can be used to manage surface water runoff from areas with high groundwater pollution
risks. Unless effective pre-treatment of sediments is included within the design, they are applicable
primarily to impervious areas where there are not high levels of particulates in the runoff.
Filter drains are generally appropriate for catchments with small impermeable areas. They can be
effectively incorporated into the landscape and public open spaces, and with careful design can have
minimal land-take requirements. They are not usually used as retrofit components due to potential
obstruction and interference with service routes.
The use of filter drains is typically restricted to sites without significant slopes, unless they can be placed
parallel to contours. The longitudinal slope should not exceed 2% because low velocities are required for
stable conveyance through the filter medium and for pollutant removal processes to occur.
Filter drains should not be sited on unstable ground, and ground stability should be verified by assessing
site soil and groundwater conditions. They are designed for intermittent flow and should be allowed
to drain and re-aerate between rainfall events. They should not, therefore, be used on sites with a
continuous flow from groundwater or other sources.
Filter drains can prove a useful surface water management component on sites where vegetated systems
are impractical. They could be constructed beneath impermeable surfacing, provided that sufficient

access is included for inspection and maintenance, or grassed/vegetated surfacing, provided that an
appropriate means of identifying and locating the trench is included within the design.
16.4 HYDRAULIC DESIGN
16.4.1 General
There are three elements to the design of filter drains
1 design of the filter material for adequate percolation of water the rate of percolation is a
compromise between pollutant removal and the need to restrict the risk of flooding in the catchment
for the design storm event, and to act as an appropriate trickling filter for small events, contact time
with the aggregate should be maximised (via geometric design characteristics)
2 design of the filter material to store water the greater the void ratio, the more storage is available in
the trench, and the level of storage available will depend on the throttle at the outlet
3 design of the pipe system to convey water
The rate of percolation of water through the filter material can be estimated roughly using Darcy’s law.
The rate of percolation should be sufficient to meet the design criteria. The storage of water within the
trench and aggregate is dependent on the void ratio of the aggregate and the downstream throttle rate.
Calculation methods are as for pervious pavements, as set out in Section 20.5.
The slotted pipe in the base of the filter drain should be designed using conventional pipe design methods
to achieve the flows required to meet the site-specific design criteria (Equation 20.2). The perforations
in the pipe should be sufficient to provide adequate flow in the same way as for bioretention systems in
Section 18.8.2.
16.4.2 Interception design
Filter drains can only deliver a small contribution to Interception (the prevention of runoff for the majority
of small events) where they do not allow infiltration. Some water will soak into the filter medium and will
also be removed by evapotranspiration and infiltration (where allowed) even if permeability levels are very
low. The extent of the volumetric reduction in runoff will depend on the infiltration rate of the surrounding
soil, the catchment area, area and depth of the system, type of vegetation and the climate.
Interception design methods are set out in Section 24.8.
ea o ontro desin
As well as determining the degree of filtration, the particle sie of the medium also determines travel time
in the filter and can therefore play a role in meeting peak flow discharge rate control requirements.
Filter drains can help to manage peak flows by naturally limiting rates of conveyance through the filter
medium, and also by providing attenuation storage which fills when the rate of flow at the outlet is
controlled. Design and assessment of the surface and subsurface storage volumes can be determined
using standard hydraulic assessment.
Subsurface storage can be provided by the void space in the filter medium and/or drainage layer in the
system, ie:
ailale attenuation storae in te filter meium an rainae layer of te ioretention system
olume of system oi ratio in te soilrainae layer
Due to the small runoff areas likely to be discharging to the system, it may be appropriate to link adjacent
systems together so that the sie of the opening in the flow control can be larger.
306 Part D: Technical detail
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
16.4.4 Volume control design
Contribution of filter drains to volume control should be evaluated using standard methods based on
expected infiltration rates and/or available attenuation storage and specified flow controls. Assessment of
volumetric control should follow the normal hydraulic assessment methods in Chapter 24.
eedane o desin
An exceedance flow route will be required for rainfall events that exceed the design capacity of the filter
drain. This can be achieved by installing an overflow pipe or weir/overflow structure above the design
water storage level to convey excess flows downstream.
The exceedance flow capacity of the
overflow should be confirmed using normal
hydraulic assessment methods and analysis
(weir, orifice and pipe flow). Exceedance
flows beyond the capacity of the overflow
should also be confirmed.
Ideally, exceedance flows should be
designed to bypass the filter drain, but where
the exceedance flow structure is within the
trench it should be located as close to the
inlet as possible to minimise the flow path
length for above-capacity flows (reducing the
risk of scouring) (Section 18.8.2).
Figure 16.3 Filter drain with exceedance event managed within
play area, Exwick, Devon (courtesy Robert Bray Associates)
16.5 TREATMENT DESIGN
Unless infiltration is allowed, filter drains will not provide a significant reduction in contaminant loads to
surface waters via volumetric runoff control, as they can only provide limited Interception (Section 16.4.2).
The acceptability of allowing infiltration from the filter drain will depend on the extent of the likely runoff
contamination and site characteristics (see Chapter 4, Table 4.3).
Hatt et al (2007) reported gravel filters to be an effective treatment option for runoff, where treatment of
sediment and heavy metals is of principal concern. Performance efficiencies reported by Hatt et al (2007)
were greater than 90% for TSS and generally 60–80% for heavy metals. However, the rate of clogging
related to these efficiencies is not given, and clogging may act to enhance perceived efficiencies. Similar
performance efficiencies are suggested by Higgins et al (2008).
Unless regular monitoring and regular gravel filter removal and washing can be accommodated, it is not
recommended to use filter drains as a sediment capture mechanism.
Further evidence relating to potential performance efficiencies of filter drains is presented in
Chapter 26, Annex 3.
Good pollutant removal performance is required for all runoff events up to and including events which occur,
on average, about once a year (termed here the 1:1 year event). The duration of this event should be the
relevant critical duration for the filter drain flow rate. If the filter drain is draining a road, then 15 minutes is
likely to be appropriate. For this water quality design event, flows should be captured by the drain and then
flow towards the outfall at low rates to maximise contact time with the gravel.
An additional filter layer can be added to provide enhanced treatment by using materials such as sand,
granular activated carbon, leaf compost or pea gravel, although this is not routine design practice and
is likely to be expensive. Coarser materials allow faster transmission of water, but finer media will filter
particles of a smaller size. Sand has been found to be a good balance, but different types of media have
different contaminant removal efficiencies. Sand is reliable at removing TSS, but organic soils are better
at heavy metal and phosphorous removal.

CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
16.6 AMENITY DESIGN
Filter drains can be designed creatively to provide
attractive boundary lines or edging.
Filter drains may be protected with geotextile and
covered with topsoil and planted with grass, in a
landscaped area. However, this increases the risk
that maintenance responsibilities will be overlooked,
which could cause performance failure of the
system and should therefore be implemented with
caution. However, overlying grass may help reduce
clogging risks on the trench surface.
16.7 BIODIVERSITY DESIGN
Gravel media can host microorganisms and provide
breeding grounds for insects and amphibians.
Adjacent biodiverse planting or overlying grass
(Section 16.6) can also deliver additional
opportunities for biodiversity.
16.8 PHYSICAL SPECIFICATIONS

(courtesy Robert Bray Associates)
16.8.1 Pre-treatment and inlets
The design, operation and maintenance of filter drain inlet structures and pre-treatment systems is
a key factor in their continued satisfactory operation. Sheet flow from an adjacent impermeable area
should pass over a vegetated filter strip (Chapter 15). For point inflows, pre-treatment should consist of
a sediment forebay or silt trap or other SuDS system (eg swale) that is easily maintained. Roof waters
can be connected directly through sediment/debris traps. Exit velocities from the pre-treatment system
to the trench should be non-erosive.
The design of inlet structures is set out in detail in Chapter 28.
16.8.2 Underdrains and outlets
Filter drains should be designed with low-level outfalls with appropriate flow control devices. Outlet
erosion protection is unlikely to be required as flows are likely to be low. Unless the component is an off-
line device, the system should be designed with appropriate overflow facilities so that design flows can be
conveyed safely downstream.
16.9 MATERIALS
Specifications for filter media and gravel media layers are provided in Chapters 18 and 30.
Specifications for geotextiles and geomembranes are provided in Chapter 30.
16.10 LANDSCAPE DESIGN AND PLANTING
Filter drains should be integrated within the surrounding space in an attractive and complementary way,
using vegetation to enhance their appearance where appropriate.
Landscape design and planting best practice is presented in Chapter 29.
308 Part D: Technical detail
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
16.11 CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS
Filter drains should be protected before completion and stabilisation of the upstream development areas.
They should not be used for drainage of construction sites, where untreated runoff is likely to contain
large amounts of silt, debris and other pollutants, as this will cause rapid clogging of the systems.
All trench excavations should follow construction best practice and be supported, if required. No
personnel should be allowed to enter an unsupported trench deeper than 1.2 m. Trench supports should
be designed to guarantee the safety of those working in the trench. Support may also be needed for
shallower trenches in weak ground.
Filter drain formations should be flat or to a shallow grade to reduce the risk of ponding and negative
filter gradients. Geotextile and stone fill should be clean before construction. Backfill should be placed in
100150 mm layers and lightly compacted as required.
All geotextiles should be wrapped and secured to prevent gravel or stone from clogging with sediments.
The drain-down time after a storm should be observed after completion or modification of the facility to
confirm that the desired drain time has been obtained (BRE, 1991).
Further detail on construction activities and the programming of construction activities is provided in
Chapter 31.
A construction phase health and safety plan is required under the Construction (Design and
Management) Regulations (CDM) 2015. This should ensure that all construction risks have been
identified, eliminated, reduced and/or controlled where appropriate.
Generic health and safety guidance is presented in Chapter 36.
16.12 OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS
Filter drains will require regular maintenance to ensure continuing operation to design performance
standards, and all designers should provide detailed specifications and frequencies for the required
maintenance activities along with likely machinery requirements and typical annual costs – within the
Maintenance Plan. The treatment performance of filter drains is dependent on maintenance, and robust
management plans will be required to ensure that maintenance is carried out in the long term. Different
designs will have different operation and maintenance requirements, but this section gives some
generic guidance.
Regular inspection and maintenance is important for the effective operation of filter drains as designed.
Maintenance responsibility for a filter drain should always be placed with an appropriate organisation.
Adequate access should always be provided to the filter drain for inspection and maintenance. If
filter drains are implemented within private property, owners should be educated on their routine
maintenance needs, and should understand the long-term Maintenance Plan and any legally binding
maintenance agreement.
Litter (including leaf litter) and debris removal should be undertaken as part of general landscape
maintenance for the site and before any other SuDS management task. All litter should be removed
from site.
Table 16.1 provides guidance on the type of operational and maintenance requirements that may be
appropriate. The list of actions is not exhaustive and some actions may not always be required.

needs of the filter drain should be monitored and maintenance schedules adjusted to suit requirements.

17Chapter Swales
This chapter provides guidance on the design of swales – shallow
vegetated channels designed principally to convey and treat runoff.
Appendix C, Section C.5.4 demonstrates how to design an underdrained swale for an
industrial area.
Appendix C, Section C.5.5 demonstrates how to design a strategic conveyance swale.
17.1 GENERAL DESCRIPTION
Swales are shallow, flat bottomed, vegetated open channels designed to convey, treat
and often attenuate surface water runoff. When incorporated into site design, they can
enhance the natural landscape and provide aesthetic and biodiversity benefits. They are
often used to drain roads, paths or car parks, where it is convenient to collect distributed
inflows of runoff, or as a means of conveying runoff on the surface while enhancing
access corridors or other open space. Swales can have a variety of profiles, can be
uniform or non-uniform, and can incorporate a range of different planting strategies,
depending upon the site characteristics and system objectives.
Swales can replace conventional pipework as a means of conveying runoff, and the use of
adjacent filter strips and/or flow spreaders can also remove the need for kerbs and gullies.
The standard swale channel is broad and shallow and covered by vegetation, usually
grass, to slow the water facilitating sedimentation, filtration through the root one
and soil matrix, evapotranspiration and infiltration into the underlying soil. A swale can
have check dams or berms installed across the flow path, that temporarily pond runoff
to increase pollutant retention and infiltration and further decrease flow velocity
particularly useful for sites with steeper gradients.
There are three types of swale, described in Sections 17.1.1 to 17.1.3.
17.1.1 Conveyance and attenuation swale
The conveyance swale is a shallow vegetated channel (Figure 17.1). These are
particularly effective ways of collecting and conveying runoff from the drained area to
another stage of the SuDS Management Train. They can be designed for treatment and/
or attenuation (where required), depending on the level of flow constraint and ponding
depths delivered by the design.
Very small swales (mini-swales) can be used to manage small events with effective
overflow facilities to alternative components.

17.1.2 Dry swale (or “enhanced” swale)
The dry swale is a vegetated conveyance channel, designed to include a filter bed of prepared soil
that overlays an underdrain system (Figure 17.2). This underdrain provides additional treatment and
conveyance capacity beneath the base of the swale, and prevents waterlogging. To prevent infiltration, or
where groundwater levels are high, a liner could be introduced at the base.
Figure 17.2 Typical dry swale
17.1.3 Wet swale
This system is equivalent to the conveyance swale, but is designed specifically to deliver wet and/or
marshy conditions in the base (Figure 17.3). They can be used where sites are very flat and soils are
poorly drained and/or to deliver the functionality or amenity or biodiversity requirements of a longitudinal
pond/wetland component. Specific wetland planting will be required for the swale base.
A typical swale plan view is given in Figure 17.5.

17.2 GENERAL DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS
Swales should generally be designed with a trapeoidal or parabolic cross-section as these are easiest to
construct and maintain, and offer good hydraulic performance.
Grass swales should generally be designed with a bottom width of 0.52.0 m, although narrower or wider
swales may be used, subject to suitable assessment. The design width should allow for shallow flows
and adequate water quality treatment (Section 17.5), while preventing flows from concentrating and
creating erosion channels. For swale widths 2 m where the width of flow may lead to flow channelling,
consideration should be given to the need to divide the cross-section with a flow divider, using a flow
spreader at the inlet for each side if required.
Longitudinal slopes should be constrained to 0.56. Check dams should be incorporated on slopes
greater than (which may allow slopes to increase up to 10) and permanent reinforcement
matting should be considered where velocities are above those recommended for standard designs.
Underdrains are required for conveyance swales with a slope of 1.5 or wet swales can be
considered for such scenarios.
The side slopes should be as flat as possible to aid pre-treatment of lateral incoming flows by maximising
the swale filtering surface, to enhance safety and allow easy access for mowing. Steeper side slopes are
likely to experience erosion channelling from incoming lateral flows. A maximum slope of 1 in () is
recommended and a 1 in (25) slope is preferred where space permits as this makes mowing easier.
Side slopes may be increased, provided all technical and safety implications have been fully considered.
When used to convey and treat road runoff, the swale length simply parallels the road, and therefore
should be equal to, or greater than, the contributing roadway length. The length of any section of swale
between culverts (eg road/drive crossings) should be 5 m or greater for maintenance access purposes.
Otherwise, the length will be that required for water quality treatment design functionality and will be a
function of the site constraints and hydraulic properties of the swale in any particular location.
The normal maximum swale depth is 00600 mm. This can be increased where deemed acceptable
by a health and safety risk assessment (Chapter 36). The depth of swale may be dependent on the
depth of required inflow pipework, for example from a permeable pavement sub-base or other upstream
component. Where the inlet depth would make the swale inappropriately deep, consideration can be
given to discharging directly to the swale underdrain and utilising the conveyance capacity of the swale
for larger events – provided there is a free route for water to rise into the swale. In such a scenario, the
swale could not be used to provide treatment for regular events, so alternative treatment methods would
be required. Deep swales will tend to mean higher land-take requirements, deeper water and costly
excavations and alternative options should potentially be considered to ensure that the optimum surface
water management system is delivered.
316 Part D: Technical detail
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Where swales allow only low levels of infiltration (ie are designed as conveyance components), provided
the soils between the swale and the groundwater provide adequate groundwater protection, and the swale
soils have appropriate organic and clay content, then pollution risks to groundwater should usually be
acceptable provided the area is not a high haard site. However, this should always be checked by following
the requirements of Table 4.3 in Chapter 4 and the design methods set out in Chapter 26. Where the
sensitivity and/or vulnerability of the underlying groundwater means that infiltration should be prevented,
swales can be designed above an impermeable geomembrane liner at a depth of at least 0.5 m, although
risks of poor construction and waterlogging should be considered.
The acceptability of infiltration from the base of the swale should be determined by following the guidance
provided in Section 25.2, complying with all relevant requirements for infiltration systems with respect to
ground stability, depth to water table etc, and Section 26.7 with respect to the protection of groundwater.
The maximum likely groundwater level should always be at least 1 m below the lowest level of the swale,
where infiltration can occur.
Health and safety risk management design guidance is presented in Chapter 36.
17.3 SELECTION AND SITING OF SWALES
Swales can be used in a wide variety of situations. They are well suited for managing runoff from roads
because they are a linear feature and easily incorporated into the roadside space. They are also suitable
for managing runoff from car parks and other impermeable and permeable areas. Swales should be
incorporated into landscape and public open spaces, as they tend to demand significant land-take due
to their shallow side slopes. Swales are generally difficult to incorporate into dense urban developments
where space is limited, although steeper side slopes may be appropriate in some situations for
example, a very shallow (150 mm deep) swale or a suitably fenced or inaccessible swale edge can have
steeper or even vertical slopes (Figure 17.6).
They are ideal for use on industrial sites (lined and
with additional downstream treatment components)
because any pollution that occurs is visible and can
therefore be dealt with before it causes damage
to the receiving watercourse. They are also much
easier to maintain on sites with high sediment loads
than any other type of component. They should not
be located in areas where there are particular risks
of excess fertiliser or weed-killer application which
could cause pollution of runoff.
Unlined swales should not be used on brownfield
sites unless it has been demonstrated that the risk
posed by leaching of contaminants is managed
to acceptable levels. Unlined swales should
not be used to treat runoff from areas with high
contaminant loadings if the risk of groundwater
pollution due to infiltration is unacceptably high.
Where a liner is used to prevent infiltration, the
seasonally high groundwater level should be below
the level of the liner. If infiltration is allowed, the
maximum likely groundwater level should be at least
1 m below the base of the system.
Swales should not be located where extensive
areas of trees or overhead structures will cause
shade conditions that could limit growth of grass (or
other vegetation). Figure 17.6 Limited)

17.4 HYDRAULIC DESIGN
17.4.1 General
Swale design is based on open channel design balancing storage, treatment and infiltration during small
storms with the need for peak flow conveyance during larger events. The hydraulic and treatment design for
swales is therefore integrally linked and design methods for both are covered together in this section.
The following should be accounted for when considering the hydraulic design of all swales
1 The swale should have adequate capacity to convey and/or store the design return period event
(component level of service). It should be noted that wet swales will tend not to recover so well from
high flows, so a reduced level of service may be appropriate.
2 The swale should have the ability to safely convey extreme event flows, or else excess flows should
be safely passed to appropriate temporary exceedance flow storage areas or conveyance paths.
3 The design event runoff volumes should half empty within 24 hours. This will help to ensure that
storage and treatment volumes are available for subsequent events and, for dry/conveyance swales,
should also protect vegetation from damage by saturated conditions.
1 Conveyance swales
Vegetation in the swale should typically be maintained at a height of 75150 mm to prevent flattening
during flow events (or suitable planting specified for a greater depth of flow).
Good pollutant removal performance is required for all runoff events up to and including events which
occur, on average, about once a year (termed here the 11 year event). The duration of this event should
be the relevant critical duration for the swale. If the swale is draining a road then 15 minutes is likely to be
appropriate. For this water quality design event
the depth of flow should be maintained below the height of vegetation (ie usually 100 mm)
the maximum flow velocity in the swale for such an event should be 0. m/s to ensure adequate
runoff filtration
the time of travel of runoff along the swale (residence time length/velocity) should be at least 9 minutes
(1 minutes from the top of the swale, if the swale has lateral inflows along its length).
To calculate the average velocity of flow in a swale, Manning’s equation should be used (Section 24.11.1).
The Manning’s n value, or the roughness coefficient indicates to what extent the surface of the swale
will resist flow, and is critical in its siing. The coefficient varies with the type of vegetative cover and the
flow depth, and a suggested relationship between flow depth and Manning’s n for grass channels is
given in Figure 17.7 with a value of 0.5 recommended for a depth of water below or equal to the height
of the grass. This coefficient will need to be increased for swales that include larger plants and/or a
greater range of plant sies.
Flow velocities for extreme events should be kept below 1.0 m/s (or 2.0 m/s if slope stability, soil erosion
and safety conditions allow) to prevent erosion. The average Manning’s n value for above grass flows
will need to be estimated, depending on the flow depth.
Check dams and appropriate pre-treatment systems can be used to improve both hydraulic and water
quality performance of a swale system by reducing velocities, increasing residence time and increasing
infiltration and/or storage (Sections 17.8.1 and 17.9.2).
Where swales are being designed for conveyance capacity in larger events, it is suggested that design
criteria for these systems should not assume extra allowances for loss of volume. Where swales are to
be designed to discharge significant volumes via infiltration, the systems should be designed as a form of
soakaway or infiltration basin (Chapter 13).
318 Part D: Technical detail
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Figure 17.7 Impact of flow depth on hydraulic roughness (from Wong, 2006)
2 Dry swales
The enhanced drainage beneath the swale can provide increased flow and storage capacity, extra
Interception performance, a reduced risk of localised ponding and marshy areas developing where
gradients are flat, and improved conditions for infiltration (where ground conditions allow).
Dry swales that are served by an underdrain
need not have an above-ground outfall
(although this is usually required for
exceedance flow management purposes)
and can therefore act as a connected length
of detention basins. Their performance is
complex as the relative head in each swale
serving the underdrain will define its hydraulic
performance. An added uncertainty is that
where the bedding around the underdrain has
a relatively low permeability, the capacity of
the underdrain itself may not be the limiting
condition. Careful design of each element is
needed to assess a system’s performance to
ensure that design events can be dealt with
without downstream flooding.
Figure 17. Dry swale with overlying flow control, Upton,
Northamptonshire (courtesy Peterborough City Council)
The velocity limits for regular and extreme events stated for conveyance swales are relevant here
but as these systems are best suited to relatively flat areas or short lengths, the design constraint is
normally its conveyance and storage performance, rather than velocity. The underdrain should usually
have flow capacity of at least 2 l/s/ha to ensure that systems can deal with multi-event scenarios. If
filtration into the underdrain will occur faster than the required limit of discharge, then a flow control on
this element will be required.
Chapter 17: Swales
19
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
3 Wet swales
The conveyance capacity of wet swales can be determined by using the same approach as for
conveyance swales. The requirement to constrain velocities for the water quality treatment event to
ensure suitable vegetative filtration will not normally be relevant, as the shallower (or ero gradient)
longitudinal slopes associated with wet swales will ensure suitable retention times.
A permanently wet swale base can provide quiescent ones for the removal of fine particles acting as
small linear pond/wetland systems (Chapter 23). Wet swales are usually appropriate where sites are
very flat and soils are poorly drained, but can be designed for more permeable sites using impermeable
liners to deliver specific treatment performance or amenity or biodiversity requirements. Wet swales will
occur naturally where high water tables rise above the swale base, but this provides a direct hydraulic link
between runoff and groundwater and should not normally be allowed (Chapter 4).
Adequate pre-treatment should be included to avoid the rapid build-up of sediments in marshy wetland
surfaces (which is more difficult and damaging to remove) and to ensure that any areas of permanent
water do not receive contaminated runoff that could pose a risk to amenity and biodiversity performance
of the system.
A minimum depth of water of 150 mm is usually appropriate to protect wetland vegetation from erosive
flows and maintain adequate resilience of the system to drought. Maximum water depths should be set
on a site-by-site basis, taking into account both technical, amenity (including safety) and biodiversity
criteria. Appropriate depth ranges should follow the guidance given for ponds and wetlands (Section
23.2).
17.4.2 Interception design
Conveyance swales and dry/enhanced swales deliver Interception because there is usually no runoff
from them for the majority of small rainfall events. The water soaks into the surface vegetated soil
layers and into the underlying soils or other media, and is removed by evapotranspiration and infiltration
(where allowed). The extent of the volumetric reduction in runoff will depend on the infiltration rate of the
surrounding soil, the capacity of any underlying filter media, the catchment area, the area of the swale,
the type of vegetation and the climate.
Where there is infiltration capacity, infiltration is acceptable and the swale is designed to facilitate even
limited infiltration, then a simple infiltration design calculation will determine whether the swale is able to
dispose of 5 mm rainfall depth over the contributing catchment area (Section 25.6).
Where there is no infiltration, but the natural surface soils (or imported or re-engineered soils) have water
storage capacity, then Interception design should follow the principles set out in Section 24.8.
Interception cannot be assumed for wet swales, unless its delivery is explicitly demonstrated in the design.
ea o ontro desin
Swales can help reduce flow rates from a site by facilitating infiltration and/or by providing attenuation
storage. For swales, the peak flow control design and assessment of the surface storage volume can be
determined by using standard hydraulic assessment. Infiltration contributions should only be included for
dry or enhanced swales, where slopes are 1.5 and where contributions to peak flow reductions are
explicitly determined by the design. The design inflows should always include runoff from the pervious
side slopes draining to the swale.
Further storage can be provided beneath the swale base using gravel or other filter/drainage medium or
geocellular crate systems (Chapter 21), that is

320 Part D: Technical detail
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
A flow control structure is generally required to constrain the rate of water discharged from the surface
and/or subsurface system (Chapter 28).
17.4.4 Volume control design
Swales are not normally assumed to provide any reduction in volume of runoff for the 1100 year, 6 hour
event, but if infiltration rates from the system are deemed to be significant for this scale of event, then this
should be explicitly accounted for by the design.
eedane o desin
An exceedance flow route will be required for rainfall events that exceed the design capacity of the swale.
This can be achieved by installing an overflow pipe or weir/overflow structure above the design water
storage level to convey excess flows downstream. As swales tend to be long linear components, several
overflows are likely to be required.
The exceedance flow capacity of the overflow(s) should be confirmed using standard hydraulic
assessment methods and analysis (weir, orifice and pipe flow) (Section 24.12). Exceedance flows beyond
the capacity of the overflow(s) should also be reviewed.
Any exceedance flow structure should be located as close to the swale inlet as possible to minimise the
flow path length for above-capacity flows (thus reducing the risk of scouring). Vegetation in wet swales
is likely to be especially vulnerable to damage from high flows. Alternatively, exceedance flows can be
diverted past the swale using alternative flow routes.
17.5 TREATMENT DESIGN
Swales can help retain runoff from small events on site (ie deliver Interception – Section 17.4.2), helping
reduce the contaminant load discharged to surface waters via volumetric control. They can also treat the
residual runoff through the following methods.
Conveyance and dry swales
Coarse to medium sediments and associated pollutants (such as nutrients, free oils/grease and
metals) can be removed by filtration through surface vegetation and groundcover.
Fine particulates and associated contaminants can be removed by infiltration through the
underlying soil and/or filter medium layers. This provides treatment by filtration, dissolved pollutant
removal by sorption of pollutants to the filter medium, and some biological uptake by vegetation
and subsoil biota.
Organic contaminants can be removed through photolysis and volatilisation.
Wet swales
Fine particulates can be removed by adsorption and sedimentation.
Nutrients and dissolved metals can be removed via biodegradation and plant uptake.
Design characteristics to deliver good pollutant removal performance are covered in Section 17.4.1, due to
the link with hydraulic performance. In the past there have been recommendations that keeping grass short
in swales prevents the grass lodging over (ie being pushed over and flattened by the flow of water) and
improves pollution removal. However, the risk of pollution removal being compromised is now considered to
be minimal, and there is no reason for a blanket requirement to keep grass short in all swales.
The acceptability of allowing infiltration from the swale will depend on the extent of the likely runoff
contamination and site characteristics (see Chapter 4, Table 4.3).
Chapter 17: Swales
321
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Research has shown that the pollutant mass removal rates of grass swales are extremely variable, depending
on influent pollutant concentrations (Bckstrm et al, 2006), but are generally moderate for most pollutants
(Barrett et al, 199, Deletic and Fletcher, 2006). Median pollutant mass removal rates of swales from available
performance studies have been reported as 76 for total suspended solids, 55 for total phosphorus and
50 for total nitrogen (Deletic and Fletcher, 2006). Significant reductions in total inc and copper event
mean concentrations have been observed in performance studies with a median value of 60, but results
have varied widely (Barrett, 200). Site specific factors such as slope, soil type, infiltration rate, swale length
and vegetative cover also affect pollutant mass removal rates. In general, the dominant pollutant removal
mechanism operating in grass swales is infiltration, rather than filtration, because pollutants trapped on
the surface of the swale by vegetation or check dams are not permanently bound (Bckstrm et al, 2006).
Evidence of the removal efficiencies of swales is presented in Chapter 26, Annex 3.
17.6 AMENITY DESIGN
Swales can be designed to fit into many different landscape types in an aesthetically pleasing manner,
often delivering attractive vegetated corridors into streetscapes and road/parking corridors (Figure 17.9).
They should be aligned to avoid sharp
bends, as these can cause erosion,
but gradual meandering bends can
be used for aesthetic purposes and
to promote slower flows. The swale
design should take account of the
required orientation, aspect and
proximity to other landscape features,
buildings etc, and the swale should
have an appropriate scale and form
to suit the surrounding landscape
character. In green open spaces they
should have a natural feel with soft
edges and flowing forms whereas
some hard edges and straight lines
may be appropriate in dense urban
landscapes. The design should always
aim to contribute to the amenity of the
local communities.
Lamb Drove (courtesy Peterborough City Council)
Plant species should be selected to suit
the existing landscape characteristics
of the site and/or to meet its visual and
design intent.
Small interpretation boards can
be provided adjacent to the swale,
potentially including information relating
to the function of the swale and the local
fauna and flora that the system supports
(Section 5.2.7).
Upton
Figure 17.9 Examples of swales providing a vegetated corridor
Swales are generally shallow surface features that do not present significant risk or danger to the health
and safety of the general public. Any residual risks can be mitigated through the design of shallow side
slopes and shallow flow depths. If there is any chance of permanent depths of water occurring, wet swale
designs should follow safety guidance given in Chapters 23 and 36.
In certain locations, some form of physical barrier may be appropriate to prevent vehicles parking on
the swale edges (eg structural planting, bollards or low railings). Large rocks or boulders tend to lead to
322 Part D: Technical detail
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
grass damage and scouring. Alternatively, the edge of the swale may be reinforced to prevent damage
from vehicles.
17.7 BIODIVERSITY DESIGN
By following the biodiversity principles in
Chapter 6, biodiversity value of any SuDS
system can be maximised. Swales can include
a variety of planting (including wildflower grass
seed mixes in areas where the grass length is
not required to be regularly maintained) that
will help make a positive contribution to urban
biodiversity providing habitat and food for
insects, invertebrates and birds.
Native plant species should normally be used
in providing a dense and durable cover of
vegetation that creates appropriate habitat for
indigenous species.
Figure 17.10 School children in a shallow swale designed for
play, Worcestershire (courtesy Robert Bray Associates)
17.8 PHYSICAL SPECIFICATIONS
17.8.1 Pre-treatment and inlets
Water should preferably be directed laterally into a swale (by draining runoff as sheet flow from the
edge of a contributing impermeable area) rather than entering the swale as a single point inflow . This
minimises erosion and disperses pollution widely in the surface vegetation. As an alternative, a series
of drop kerbs at frequent intervals can be used.
However, the transition from the kerb to the swale
should ensure that the vegetation behind the kerb
does not obstruct the flow of water to the swale.
Where runoff is directed into swales by flow-
concentrating devices such as gullies or pipes,
the risk of erosion and silting is increased. This
should be mitigated by constructing inlets with
flow spreaders and erosion control, together with
appropriate pre-treatment. Also the catchment area
draining to any single inlet should be minimised.
Where swales are located next to roads, a lateral
gravel-filled drain may be provided at the edge of
the pavement construction in order to prevent water
seeping into the pavement layers and subgrade and
affecting the structural strength of the road.
Shallow side slopes or vegetated filter strips at the
edge of the impervious surface are useful as a pre-
treatment system for runoff entering swales and will
improve the water quality performance of the system.
There should be a drop of at least 50 mm from the
pavement (or hard surface) edge to any vegetated
surface to prevent the formation of a sediment lip.

CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
17.8.2 Underdrains and outlets
Underdrains should use PVC perforated pipe (minimum diameter usually 100 mm) with 150 mm clean
gravel above the pipe. The gravel and pipe should be enclosed by geotextile fabric. The underdrain
should infiltrate into the subsoils or drain freely to an acceptable discharge point.
Detailed underdrain design guidance is set out in Section 18.8.2.
An outlet pipe has to be provided from the swale channel (for conveyance swales) and/or underdrain
systems (for dry/enhanced swales) to the point of discharge. Outlet erosion protection may be required.
An overflow structure and non-erosive overflow channel should be provided to safely pass flows in
excess of the swale storage capacity to the downstream drainage system.
Inspection pipes should be provided to underdrains to provide access for performance observations
and cleaning.
Outlet structures are discussed in detail in Chapter 28.
17.9 MATERIALS
17.9.1 Filter media and underdrain
Guidance for the specification of materials for any underlying filter media and underdrains are set
out in Section 18.9.
17.9.2 Check dams
Where required, check dams are typically provided at 10–20 m intervals and the water level at the toe of
the upstream dam should be the same level as the crest of the downstream dam (Figure 17.13). Check
dams may be constructed from coarse aggregate
(100600 mm, eg Class 6B material as specified
in DfT, 199), wooden boards, gabions or earth (if
adequately protected against erosion), rip-rap or
concrete (where appropriate). Wood used for check
dams should consist of pressure treated logs or
timbers, or water-resistant tree species such as
cedar, hemlock, swamp oak or locust.
Energy dissipation and erosion protection materials
should extend 1–2 m downstream of the dam
across both the base and sides of the swale, if
required. Check dams should be constructed into
the sides of the swale to ensure that water does
not bypass the structure and a small orifice or pipe
at the base of the dam will allow low flows to be
conveyed downstream. Risks of orifice blockage
should always be considered. Interconnections
should be designed so that flow does not resuspend
settled material or cause local erosion, and so
that floating solids and surface films are retained.
Figures 17.14 and 17.15 show examples of granular
and timber check dams, respectively. Figure
17.12 shows how check dams can be designed to
complement the local landscape.

Gravel flow spreaders should comprise washed stone of 10 mm in diameter. The diaphragm should be
at least 300 mm wide and 600 mm deep.
17.9.4 Flow dividers
Flow dividers (if required) should be constructed of a firm material that will resist weathering and erosion,
such as concrete, recycled plastic or a compacted soil berm seeded with the swale vegetation. Materials
used for this purpose must not leach chemicals into the swale. If erosion is likely to be a problem, then
erosion control fabrics, coir blankets or geotextiles can be used.
Chapter 17: Swales

CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
17.10 LANDSCAPE DESIGN AND PLANTING
Grasses and herbaceous species with a soil-binding root structure and dense cover should be favoured
along the bottom of the swale for their ability to increase infiltration, stabilise soils, retain and filter pollutants
and assist with suspended solids retention. Where swales are used to drain runoff from roads or car park
areas that are likely to be regularly salted during winter months, the planting should be salt tolerant.
The plant material on the slopes of grass channels should be capable of withstanding periodic inundation
in addition to extended periods of drought. Appropriate species include robust, fine-growing grasses and
groundcovers as well as low shrub species. Native species are generally most appropriate, and mixtures
of perennial ryegrass and fescues are particularly suitable for use in swales in the UK. Longer grasses
and wildflower areas, if considered beneficial for other reasons, are not considered to pose a significant
risk to performance.
Trees can be included within a design, provided that the required sun-shade conditions needed for
adequate growth of the predominant groundcover vegetation are fully considered. The requirements for
topsoil depths and specifications will vary, depending on the design planting.
Fertilising a swale should be avoided if possible, particularly where the receiving environment is sensitive
to nutrient loadings.
Emergent vegetation can be planted in wet swales or, alternatively, wetland soils may be spread on the
swale bottom for seed stock. However, dense planting should be avoided, and systems should be allowed
to colonise naturally to an extent. For wet swales, it is best to plant several species to increase the chance
that at least some of the selected species will find growing conditions favourable.
For dry swales, plants can be placed as turf, seeds or less commonly as individual plants, such as plug
plants or rooted specimens. Turf provides immediate protection, provided the seams are protected by
laying the strips perpendicular to the flow of water and hand tamping them after laying. Turf should also
be secured with pegs where high flow velocities are expected and on side slopes that are greater than
1 in . A swale is best seeded during spring and early summer months to give vegetation the whole
length of a growing season to establish. Grasses will need to be maintained at lengths of 75150 mm to
ensure performance during regular events.
Landscape design and planting best practice is presented in detail in Chapter 29.
17.11 CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS
Grass swales should be clearly marked before site work begins and protected by signage and silt fencing
to avoid their disturbance during construction. No vehicular traffic, except that specifically used to construct
the component, should be allowed close to the swale. Excavating equipment should operate from the side
of the swale and not the base. If compaction of soils does occur, a minimum of 00 mm depth of soil should
be removed and replaced with a blend of topsoil and sand to promote infiltration and biological growth.
Care should be taken that design levels and slopes for inlets and swale base and sides are constructed
accurately to avoid runoff bypassing swale inlets, ponding in the swale base and flow channelling. Even
the smallest non-conformities may compromise flow conditions.
Swales should not receive any runoff until the vegetation is fully established and construction at the
site has reached a state where sediment loads will not cause rapid siltation of the swale. This can be
achieved by
diverting flows until the vegetation is well rooted
placing an erosion control blanket (eg jute, straw or geosynthetic mats) over the freshly applied seed mix
using bare earth as a temporary cover during the wet season these areas should be seeded with a
suitable grass mix as soon as the weather is conducive to seed germination.

CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
If sediment from construction work accumulates
on a swale it should be cleared and the swale
fully rehabilitated before the drainage system
is adopted by the organisation carrying out the
maintenance.
The swale should be planted at a time of year
when successful plant establishment without
irrigation is most likely (noting that temporary
irrigation may still be required if the period is
especially dry). Freshly seeded areas should
be stabilised with appropriate temporary or
permanent soil stabilisation methods, such as
erosion control matting or blankets. If more
than 0 of the planted area is bare after
four weeks, reseeding or replanting should be
considered to achieve 90 coverage.

Further detail on construction activities and the programming of construction activities is provided in
Chapter 31.
A construction phase health and safety plan is required under the Construction (Design and Management)
Regulations (CDM) 2015. This should ensure that all construction risks have been identified, eliminated,
reduced and/or controlled where appropriate.
Generic health and safety guidance is provided in Chapter 36.
17.12 OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS
Swales will require regular maintenance to ensure continuing operation to design performance standards,
and all designers should provide detailed specifications and frequencies for the required maintenance
activities along with likely machinery requirements and typical annual costs – within the Maintenance
Plan. The treatment performance of swales is dependent on maintenance, and robust management plans
will be required to ensure maintenance is carried out in the long term. Different designs will have different
operation and maintenance requirements, but this section gives some generic guidance.
Maintenance of swales is relatively straightforward for landscape contractors, and typically there should
only be a small amount of extra work (if any) required for a swale over and above what is necessary for
standard public open space. Provided that landscape management is already required at site, swale
maintenance should have marginal cost implications. However, regular inspection and maintenance are
important for the effective operation of swales as designed. Maintenance responsibility for a swale should
always be placed with an appropriate organisation. If swales are implemented within private property,
owners should be educated on their routine maintenance needs, and should understand the long-term
Maintenance Plan and any legally binding maintenance agreement.
Adequate access should be provided to all swale areas for inspection and maintenance, including for
appropriate equipment and vehicles. Litter and debris removal should be undertaken as part of general
landscape maintenance for the site and before any other SuDS management task. All litter should be
removed from site.
The major maintenance requirement for dry swales is mowing. Mowing should ideally retain grass lengths
of 75150 mm across the main treatment surface, to assist in filtering pollutants and retaining sediments
and to reduce the risk of flattening during runoff events. However, longer vegetation lengths, where
appropriate, are not considered to pose a significant risk to functionality.
Chapter 17: Swales
327
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Grass clippings should be disposed of either off
site or outside the area of the swale, to remove
nutrients and pollutants. For wet swales,
mowing of wetland vegetation is not required.
However, harvesting of very dense vegetation
may be desirable in the autumn after plant
die-back, to prevent the discharge of excess
organic material into receiving waters. All
vegetation management activities should take
account of the need to maximise biosecurity
and prevent the spread of invasive species.
Occasionally sediment will need to be removed
(eg once deposits exceed 25 mm in depth),
although this can be minimised by ensuring
that upstream areas are stabilised and by
Figure 17.17 Grass cutting of roadside swale, Stirlingshire
(courtesy Abertay University)
incorporating effective pre-treatment devices.
Available evidence from monitoring studies
indicates that small distributed infiltration practices such as swales do not contaminate underlying soils,
even after more than 10 years of operation (TRCA, 2008). Sediments excavated from a swale that
receives runoff from residential or standard road and roof areas are generally not toxic or haardous
material and can therefore be safely disposed of by either land application or landfilling. However,
consultation should take place with the environmental regulator to confirm appropriate protocols.
Sediment testing may be required before sediment excavation to determine its classification and
appropriate disposal methods. For runoff from busy streets with high vehicle traffic, sediment testing
will be essential. Any damage due to sediment removal or erosion should be repaired and immediately
reseeded or planted.
Further detail on waste management is provided in Chapter 33.
Table 17.1 provides guidance on the type of operational and maintenance requirements that may be
appropriate. The list of actions is not exhaustive and some actions may not always be required.
Maintenance Plans and schedules should be developed during the design phase. Specific maintenance
needs of the swales should be monitored, and maintenance schedules adjusted to suit requirements.
Further detail on the preparation of maintenance specifications and schedules of work is given in
Chapter 32.
CDM 2015 requires designers to ensure that all maintenance risks have been identified, eliminated,
reduced and/or controlled where appropriate. This information will be required as part of the health and
safety file.
Generic health and safety guidance is provided in Chapter 36.

18Chapter Bioretention systems
This chapter provides guidance on the design of bioretention systems
(including rain gardens) – shallow planted depressions that allow runoff
to pond temporarily on the surface before filtering through vegetation
and underlying soils for collection or infiltration
Appendix Section demonstrates how to design an infiltrating bioretention
system for a civic street
18.1 GENERAL DESCRIPTION
Bioretention systems (including rain gardens) are shallow landscaped depressions that
can reduce runoff rates and volumes, and treat pollution through the use of engineered
soils and vegetation. They are particularly effective in delivering Interception and can
also provide:
attractive landscape features that are self-irrigating and fertilising
habitat and biodiversity
cooling of the local microclimate due to evapotranspiration.
They are a very flexible surface water management component that can be integrated
into a wide variety of development landscapes using different shapes, materials,
planting and dimensions. In a low density development, the system might have soft
edges and gentle side slopes, while a high density application might have hard edges
with vertical sides.
They are generally used for managing and treating runoff from frequent rainfall
events. Where larger events are directed to the system, consideration of the impact of
design velocities on the system will be required. It is often more appropriate to pass
runoff from extreme events directly to drainage components further downstream, via
an overflow or bypass.
Runoff collected by the system ponds temporarily on the surface and then filters
through the vegetation and underlying soils. Specified engineered soil mixes can be
used as filter media to enhance bioretention treatment performance, and designs can
be implemented that include submerged anaerobic zones to promote nutrient removal.
The filtered runoff is either collected using an underdrain system or, if site conditions
allow, fully or partially infiltrated into the surrounding soil (subject to suitable site
conditions – Chapter 25). Part of the runoff volume will be removed through
evaporation and plant transpiration. The main hydraulic benefit of using bioretention
systems is providing Interception. However, attenuation storage on the surface or within
the drainage layer can be used to help manage runoff rates. Check dams or weirs can
also be used to slow the flow of water moving across the surface of the system.
There are many different approaches to the design of bioretention systems and
rain gardens. However, the main components that are usually provided in a
bioretention system are shown in Figure 18.1 In general, the systems should not have
impermeable liners, unless there is a specific need to prevent water from infiltrating,
such as at locations close to structural foundations (Chapter 25) or for groundwater
protection (Chapter 26).
Chapter 18: Bioretention systems
333
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Figure 18.1 Components of a bioretention system
The main functions of the different elements of the system are as follows:
Inlet – The inlet design is critical and should be designed to prevent scour and erosion and to evenly
distribute water onto the filter surface (Section 18.8.1).
Depth of extended detention – This is temporary storage of water on the surface to capture the volume
that requires treatment and (if required) provide attenuation. Normally this will be at a maximum depth of
150–300 mm.
Vegetation Vegetation influences the performance of the system through direct uptake of pollutants
and by facilitating physical and chemical processes in the soil that remove nutrients. It also prevents
erosion of the surface soil layers and helps maintain the permeability of the filter medium. Vegetation can
have a strong influence on the amenity and biodiversity value of the system. Vegetation selection is very
site specific and requires the input of landscape architects, ecologists or horticultural or arboricultural
experts.
Filter medium – This material is normally sand-based with some source of organic matter and slow-
release plant nutrients to maintain healthy plant growth. It filters out pollutants and controls the rate
at which water filters through the system, which is a key influence on the effectiveness. It is normally
750–1000 mm deep, although for very small catchments it can be less than this (eg where a raised
planter is draining only a small area of roof). An absolute minimum of 400 mm is recommended, and in
such situations the system should only contain ground cover plants. Proprietary filter media that have
enhanced performance may be used to reduce the area and depth of filter medium required.
Transition layer This is required to prevent the washing of fines from the filter medium into the
drainage layer. To achieve this it should be at least 100 mm deep and should be designed using standard
geotechnical filter criteria (Chapter 30). Alternatively a geotextile layer can be used, which again should
be designed using standard filter criteria. There have been instances of geotextile layers clogging in
bioretention systems and some publications (eg the Facility for Advanced Water Biofiltration (FAWB),
200) recommend that they are not used. However, appropriate specification of the pore sie and
permeability of the geotextile in relation to the soils above it should reduce the risk of this occurring and
334 Part D: Technical detail
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
the risk should not be any different from that for clogging of a transition layer (Chapter 30). The main
location where silt accumulates in a bioretention system is on the surface of the soil filter.
Drainage layer The purpose of this layer is to collect water from the filter medium and allow it to reach
the perforated pipes easily. The drainage layer should provide adequate cover to the perforated pipes
(typically at least 100 mm) and should be of sufficient thickness to ensure that the flow rate of water
through it to the pipes is greater than the flow rate of water into the layer from the overlying filter medium
and/or transition layer. Geocellular units can also be used in place of the drainage layer and pipes,
especially if extra attenuation storage volume is required.
The depth of the drainage layer will be determined by the underdrain pipe diameter, minimum pipe cover,
the level of the outfall/connection, slope of the underdrain and the length of the system being drained, and
any requirements for storage. In general, the minimum pipe cover of the gravel drainage layer should be
50 mm to avoid ingress of the sand transition layer into the pipe. Where the drainage layer is acting as a
storage layer, the depth should be determined using calculations or modelling but as a general guide the
subsurface storage one should be at least as large as the surface storage one to ensure that the filter
medium does not become saturated after consecutive rainfall events.
Perforated pipes – These collect water from the system and convey it downstream. They may not be
required if the system is designed to infiltrate. Pipes should have a rodding eye, to allow access for
cleaning (this could be combined with the overflow).
ero This is achieved with standpipes, weirs or other channel to direct flow to downstream
components, once the volume of the system has been exceeded.
There are many different variations of the bioretention system, described in the following sections.
18.1.1 Rain garden
Rain gardens are typically small systems that serve part of a single property (roof or driveway). They
are likely to be less engineered than full bioretention components. In simple rain gardens, filter and
drainage layers are generally replaced by a thin (200–500 mm) layer of compost/sand-amended native
soils or specified soil mixes (engineered soils). They usually have a simple inflow where rainwater enters
the garden and they have a maximum depth of standing water of 150 mm. They can have an above-
ground overflow where excess water exits, although in some instances a simple underdrain may be
more effective than providing a small control structure (Figure 18.2). Guidance on simple rain gardens is
provided in Bray et al (2012).
Rain gardens can offer a variety of creative design interpretations to suit the site. In Figure 18.3 the
size and design of the rain gardens were chosen by the property owners to provide a distinctive feature
in their gardens.
There needs to be a mechanism to ensure that property owners carry out the necessary maintenance of
rain gardens so that they continue to perform their drainage function effectively.

18.1.2 Raised planter
These are boxed systems (that can be
prefabricated) constructed above the
surrounding ground surface, with a planted
soil mix and an underdrain to collect the
filtered water. They are often used to
manage runoff from adjacent roofs, and
this type of system is useful for retrofitting
in urban situations. Raised planters are
not normally used as infiltration systems
(Figures 18.4 and 18.5).

18.1.3 Bioretention tree pit
These are tree pits (see Chapter 19 for guidance on design) with enhanced performance achieved
through extra surface planting (Figure 18.6). Trees and large shrubs are beneficial in bioretention
systems as they:
intercept precipitation and allow water to evaporate from leaf surfaces
dissipate rainfall-runoff energy
facilitate infiltration and groundwater recharge, because of their more extensive root systems
provide shade and can reduce runoff temperatures
provide further amenity and biodiversity benefits.

18.1.4 Bioretention swale (or trench)
These are bioretention systems that are located
within the base of a swale (often referred to as
bioswales in the USA) (Figure 18.7). They may
involve a continuous component of bioretention
along the length of the swale, or a portion of
bioretention before the outlet of the swale. They are
similar to an underdrained swale (see Chapter 17).
Flows up to the treatment design event (ie from a
11 year event or less) soak into the filter and are
collected by an underdrain. During events that
exceed 11 year water will flow along the swale. The
flow velocity and vegetation should be designed
so that when water flows along the bioretention
swale the filter material is not eroded. To achieve
effective biofiltration, the base of the swale has to
be constructed as a series of flat areas that are
terraced down the length of the swale.
The vegetation used in the system should be
tolerant of the likely inundation and flows that occur
in this type of system.
Figure 18.7 Bioretention swale (courtesy Derwent Estuary)
18.1.5 Anaerobic bioretention system
The anaerobic bioretention system has the outlet pipe designed so that there is a permanent water level
within the drainage layer. The water storage allows the vegetation to access it during dry periods and it
assists with treatment of some pollutants (eg nitrogen). This type of system is particularly good where
trees are planted, as the roots can readily access the stored water. If the submerged zone also contains a
carbon source (eg hardwood chips at around 5% by volume) then this has been shown to further improve
nitrate and heavy metal removal (FAWB, 2008).
Figure 18.8 shows a typical anaerobic bioretention system. If the permeability of the surrounding soil is
too high (> 1 × 107 m/s) an impermeable liner may be required to hold water in the system and maintain
the standing water level. It is important that the standing water level does not cause waterlogging of the
soils above in which plants/trees are rooted and the depths of the overlying soil and level of the outfall
should be designed to ensure this does not occur.

18.2 GENERAL DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS
Bioretention systems can be designed to manage a wide range of rainfall events, the limiting factors being
the size of the catchment and the available space for the system. However, as a general principle, the
systems should drain relatively small areas close to the source of runoff. They will not work effectively if
designed to drain large catchments that discharge into the system at a single location without flow control.
For larger catchments, a series of cascading systems could be considered. Smaller rainfall events may be
filtered via the system, and larger rainfall events may bypass the system via an overflow.
Bioretention areas are generally applied to small catchments and the maximum recommended area that
should drain to a bioretention system is 0.8 ha (Davis, 2008).
Likely inflow velocities should always be considered and suitable flow distribution and erosion protection
measures put in place that are appropriate to the likely inlet flow velocity. Larger sites can be divided into
several smaller parcels with multiple and/or linked bioretention zones.
Typically the surface area of the bioretention system should be 2–4% of the overall site area to be drained
(FAWB, 2009) to prevent rapid clogging of the bioretention surface.
Bioretention areas are designed for intermittent flow and the surface should be designed to drain and
re-aerate between rainfall events. This prevents the growth of moss, algae and biofilms which can clog
the surface.
Bioretention areas can be used in most ground conditions. The surface of a bioretention system should
be level to allow distribution of flows across it. They are, therefore, slightly more difficult to incorporate
effectively within steeper catchments where they may require some form of small retaining structure or
earth embankment to achieve this. However, rain gardens have been effectively used in sloping sites
(Figure 18.9). The height of the retaining structures should be small to minimise health and safety risks
(kerb height or similar). If drops greater than kerb height are proposed it may be appropriate to place a
wall, hedge, or fence around the edges.
Where the underlying groundwater is not adequately protected from potential pollution risks, infiltration
from contaminated surface runoff should be prevented, and the systems should be designed with an
impermeable geomembrane liner and a positive connection to the main site drainage. Where a liner is
Chapter 18: Bioretention systems
339
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Cheltenham (courtesy EPG Limited and Illman Young) Portland (courtesy Illman Young)
Figure 18.9 Partially raised rain gardens on sloping sites
used to prevent infiltration, the seasonally high groundwater level should be below the level of the liner. If
infiltration is allowed, the maximum likely groundwater level should be at least 1 m below the base of the
system (Chapter 25).
Bioretention systems can be used to provide treatment of water before its use in harvesting systems (note
that disinfection of the discharge from the feature will still be required where treatment of pathogens is
critical). Solar-powered pumps have been used for this purpose where the water is used for irrigation.
However, it should be recognised that these systems do tend to reduce volumes of runoff, thus reducing
the available yield. Lined systems vegetated with small plants such as ornamental grass can be used to
minimise evapotranspiration losses.
Systems with an underdrain should have cleaning access to the drain (for smaller systems this could be
via the overflow to the drain).
Health and safety risk management design guidance is presented in Chapter 36.
18.3 SELECTION AND SITING OF BIORETENTION SYSTEMS
Bioretention systems are applicable to most types of development, and can be used in both residential
and non-residential areas to mitigate polluted runoff from roads. They can be implemented in private
curtilage for managing runoff from single properties, in small shared public areas, on car park islands,
roundabouts, footpaths, traffic calming and pedestrian ones (streetscapes). Bioretention systems
can be used to buffer structures, enhance privacy, and for aesthetic site features. Linear bioretention
systems can be placed along roads, central reservations and build-outs, and help control flooding of
the carriageway.
They are often a cost-effective retrofit option, due to their flexibility in sie and detailing. They can be
integrated within existing landscaped areas, within traffic islands or underused parking or road space
when street works are planned for other reasons.
Bioretention systems should be incorporated into the site landscaping such that they do not require extra
land-take over and above the landscaping that would normally be required for the development. The width
of the system should be greater than 600 mm (less than this is difficult to construct) and less than 20 m (so
it can be maintained using a 10 m reach excavator with access to both sides). If access is only available
from one side, the maximum width should be 10 m. The maximum length should be 0 m to avoid uneven
distribution of water over the surface, and the total filter area should not exceed 00 m2. In practice, most
examples that have been installed around the world are much smaller than these maximum dimensions and
are integrated into the landscape as small local features.
340 Part D: Technical detail
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Greater thicknesses of filter medium and a saturated drainage layer (anaerobic bioretention system
Section 18.1) are more appropriate where trees will be planted in the system and also if the vegetation
proposed is less tolerant of drought. The larger the surface area of the system the more valuable a
permanent body of water is, because it allows water to be evenly distributed below the whole of the filter
medium and provides better irrigation for the plants that are remote from the inlet.
The acceptability of infiltration from the base of a bioretention system should be determined by following
the guidance provided in Section 25.2, complying with all relevant requirements for infiltration systems
with respect to ground stability, depth to water table etc, and Section 26.7 , with respect to the protection
of groundwater.
Building control departments may require unlined rain gardens to be located greater than 5 m from
building foundations. If rain gardens are located closer than 5 m, a full assessment of the risks should
be carried out by a suitably qualified geotechnical engineer or engineering geologist. If a rain garden
manages water from a small area (< 20 m2) is less than 300 mm deep, has a surface area greater than 2
m2 and is greater than m from foundations, such an assessment may not be necessary except for sites
where there is contamination, steep slopes nearby or a history of instability such as sink holes. The local
building control department will be able to provide advice.
18.4 HYDRAULIC DESIGN
18.4.1 General
A key hydraulic design consideration for bioretention systems is the delivery of the runoff onto the surface
of the filter medium. Flow should not scour the bioretention surface and needs to be uniformly distributed
over the full filter medium surface area. Inflow velocities should be below 0.5 m/s (or 1.5 m/s for the 1100
year rainfall event).
When a bioretention system runs along the full length of a conveyance swale, the bed should be level
in a series of terraces. For other applications, the desirable gradient of the bioretention zone is either
horizontal or as close as possible to horizontal to encourage uniform distribution of runoff over the
full surface area of the bioretention filter medium and to allow efficient temporary storage of flows for
treatment before bypass occurs.
In steeper areas, where a bioretention system is used at the end of swale, check dams can be
implemented along the system to reduce flow velocities discharged onto the bioretention filter medium.
A check dam is a simple structure or mechanism that can consist of anything from an area on an
existing slope where water can temporarily pond before proceeding further, to a small weir device that
ponds water and spreads its flow. It should be noted that check dams should be designed to allow easy
maintenance of grass, or other vegetation may be appropriate in these areas.
More frequent storm events are treated as water filters through the system and those that exceed the
design treatment volume of water bypass the treatment system via an overflow. The design approach for
bioretention systems is generally based on providing the following:
sufficient surface area and depth to contain the required treatment volume and allow infiltration to
the filter medium between storm events (normally 15000 mm)
an adequate hydraulic residence (filtration) time through the system to enable sediments and
attached pollutants to be retained by selection of suitable planting/filter media
extra storage in the drainage layer below the filter medium if required for attenuation.
Selection of an appropriate bioretention filter medium is a key design step involving consideration of three
interrelated factors:
the saturated hydraulic conductivity (permeability) required to optimise the treatment performance of
the bioretention component given site constraints on available filter medium area
Chapter 18: Bioretention systems
341
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
the depth of extended detention provided above the filter medium
the suitability of the medium to support vegetation growth (ie retaining sufficient soil moisture and
organic content)
The permeability of generic soil filter media should be between 10000 mm/h (see Box 18.1 for
example filter media specification). However, to allow for initial clogging rates (which tend to repair as
the plant community establishes itself and the rooting depth increases), the design should be based
on 50 of the measured hydraulic conductivity of the compacted medium. Proprietary filter media may
achieve acceptable performance with permeability values outside this range, which should be verified by
independent test results.
Good pollutant removal performance is required for all runoff events up to and including events that
occur, on average, about once a year (termed here the 1:1 year event). The duration of this event
should be the relevant critical duration for the bioretention system. For this water quality design event,
bioretention systems should be designed so that they provide sufficient area to temporarily store the
required treatment volume as a layer of not more than 150–200 mm depth on the surface. This will
enhance evaporation and should limit the amount of time water is standing on the surface of the facility
so that plants do not become waterlogged. It is recommended that a bioretention system should de-water
within 2 hours of a design storm occurring. This, together with the specified permeability limits for
the filter medium, should provide sufficient contact time to remove pollutants but ensure that the system
is ready to receive subsequent events. It may be possible to allow a greater depth of water to attenuate
more extreme events (eg up to 500 mm) if appropriate considering the landscape and safety context.
The surface area required to achieve this can be calculated by using Equation 18.1.
EQ.
18.1
Calculating required bioretention surface area
where:
Af surface area of filter bed (m2)
Vt = volume of water to be treated (m3) (for a 1:1 year critical duration rainfall event)
L filter bed depth (m)
k coefficient of permeability of filter media for water (m/s)
h average height of water above filter bed (half maximum height) (m)
t time required for water quality treatment volume to percolate through filter bed (s)
For design purposes, the surface area and filter bed depth are normally chosen, and the equation
rearranged to calculate the time required for the volume of water to pass through the system. This
should be 2 hours. Note that an overflow or exceedance flow route is required for events that
exceed the capacity of the system.
Where the systems are designed as infiltration systems, the filter medium permeability will dictate the
rate at which infiltration from the system occurs (where this is lower than the infiltration capacity of the
surrounding soils). Where the filter medium has conductivities of one to two orders of magnitude (ie 10 to
100 times) greater than that of the local soils, the preferred flow path for runoff will be vertically through
the filter medium and into underdrains at the base of the filter medium. However, if the selected saturated
filter medium hydraulic conductivity is less than 10 times that of the local soils, then impermeable liners
may be required to prevent infiltration. It may also be necessary to provide an impermeable liner to
the sides of the filter medium to prevent horiontal exfiltration and subsequent short-circuiting of the
treatment provided by the bioretention system.

18.4.2 Interception design
Bioretention systems deliver Interception because there is no runoff from them for the majority of
small rainfall events. The water soaks into the filter medium and is removed by evapotranspiration
and infiltration (where allowed). The extent of the volumetric reduction in runoff will depend on the
infiltration rate of the surrounding soil, the catchment area, area and depth of the system, type of
vegetation and the climate.
Interception design should follow the guidance provided in Section 24.8.
ea o ontro desin
Bioretention systems can help reduce flow rates from a site by providing some attenuation storage and
can reduce storage volume requirements where infiltration occurs. For bioretention systems and rain
gardens the peak flow control design and assessment of the surface storage volume can be determined
using standard hydraulic assessment and treating the surface of the system as an infiltration basin. The
permeability of the filter medium should be used as the infiltration rate.
Subsurface storage can be provided by the void space in the filter medium and/or drainage layer in the system
ailale attenuation storae in te filter meium an rainae layer of te
bioretention system = Volume of system × porosity in the soil/drainage layer
The drainage layer materials normally used will have a porosity of at least 30%. Filter layer materials may
have a lower porosity, but the value is easily measured by simple tests (Chapter 30).
A flow control structure may be required to constrain the rate of water discharged from the system. Due
to the small runoff areas likely to be discharging to the system, it may be appropriate to link adjacent
systems together so that the control system can be larger, to reduce the risk of blockage.
18.4.4 Volume control design
Contribution of bioretention systems to volume control should be evaluated using standard methods,
based on expected infiltration rates and/or available attenuation storage and specified flow controls.
Assessment of volumetric control should follow the method described in Chapter 3.
eedane o desin
An exceedance flow route will be required for rainfall events that exceed the design capacity of the
bioretention system. This can be achieved by installing an overflow pipe, weir or overflow structure above
the design water storage level of the reservoir layer to convey excess flows downstream.
The exceedance flow capacity of the overflow should be confirmed using normal hydraulic assessment
methods and analysis (weir, orifice and pipe flow). Exceedance flows beyond the capacity of the overflow
should also be confirmed.
Any exceedance flow structure should be located in the biofiltration basin and as close to the inlet as
possible to minimise the flow path length for above-capacity flows, thus reducing the risk of scouring
(Section 18.8.2).
18.5 TREATMENT DESIGN
Bioretention systems can provide very effective treatment functionality through:
the removal of sediments (especially fine sediment) and associated pollutants (such as nutrients,
free oils/grease and metals) by filtration through surface vegetation and groundcover
Chapter 18: Bioretention systems
343
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
the removal of fine particulates and associated contaminants by infiltration through the underlying
filter medium layers this provides treatment by filtration, extended detention treatment and some
biological uptake by vegetation and subsoil biota
the removal of dissolved pollutants by sorption of pollutants to the filter medium.
The sizing of the bioretention surface area to deliver effective treatment is presented in Box 18.1 – due to
its links with hydraulic performance of the system.
The acceptability of allowing infiltration from the bioretention component will depend on the extent of the
likely runoff contamination and site characteristics (see Chapter 4, Table 4.3).
Correctly designed and maintained bioretention systems have been shown, in numerous studies, to retain
pollutants, even when receiving snow melt that contains de-icing salt constituents (Muthanna et al, 2007).
Pollutant removal efficiencies of bioretention systems that are designed in accordance with the guidelines
from FAWB (2009) are summarised in Table 18.1. Note that all quoted removal efficiencies are event
specific and will depend on factors such as antecedent conditions.
TABLE

Total phosphorous > 80%
Nitrogen 50% on average
Metals (zinc, lead, cadmium) > 90%
Metals (copper) up to 60%
Evidence of the pollutant removal efficiencies of bioretention components, from the International BMP
database is presented in Chapter 26, Annex 3.
Vegetation that grows in the filter medium enhances its function by trapping and absorbing physical
pollutants and preventing erosion of the filter medium. It also improves the performance of the system by
continuously breaking up the soil through plant growth to prevent clogging of the system, and providing
biofilms on plant roots that pollutants can absorb or otherwise adhere to. While the type of vegetation
varies depending on landscape requirements and climate, the filtration process generally improves with
denser and higher vegetation. The type of plants used in bioretention systems affects the treatment
performance. A study by the FAWB (2008) and others has found that there is marked variation in
pollutant removal per unit plant mass between different species. The key factors that should therefore be
considered in design are:
plants that are well-adapted to ephemeral wet/dry conditions and have extensive root systems are
likely to be most effective for treatment
shallow-rooted plants are not particularly effective at nitrogen removal
incorporating submerged zones will help maintain vegetation and avoid nitrogen spikes following dry
periods of weather.
Soil filter media should be specified to meet the FAWB (2009) guidelines, as this appears to be most
effective for pollution removal (Chapter 30). For smaller-scale rain gardens that are only collecting
roof water, the FAWB guidelines may be too onerous, although the permeability requirements should
be retained if the water leaves via an underdrain. Proprietary filter media should have demonstrated
performance characteristics that are verified by an independent test organisation.
344 Part D: Technical detail
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
18.6 AMENITY DESIGN
Bioretention systems are very flexible in terms of sie and appearance. They can deliver significant
aesthetic benefits by incorporating vegetation into streetscape and general landscape features. They can
be easily integrated into a variety of urban space including car parks, pedestrian areas, streetscapes,
plazas and forecourts. They can form part of the local landscape as unobtrusive features or they can be
prominent features contributing strongly to urban space and/or building design, but they should always be
sensitive to landscape requirements and aim to enhance community areas. As rain gardens they can take
small areas of roof water and can be located in any green space or can be hard features such as raised
planters on patios as bioretention swales along the road edge they can assist in defining the boundary of
the road or green street corridors.
Bioretention systems can be used to treat runoff before use for non-potable requirements, and they can
deliver water-efficient landscaping, particularly in dry areas, by storing runoff as a saturated layer beneath
the system, creating a reservoir that can be accessed by overlying plants. Bioretention systems are also
potentially beneficial to the local microclimate by cooling air through evapotranspiration.
Fencing of bioretention systems is generally not desirable as it may reduce the amenity benefits provided
by the facility and make maintenance more difficult.
18.7 BIODIVERSITY DESIGN
Bioretention systems can provide quality habitat conditions for wildlife, contributing positively to
biodiversity enhancement in urban areas. The systems are relatively flexible in terms of the planting that
can be included, although native species are desirable to satisfy biodiversity action plans. Therefore they
can be designed to support local biodiversity requirements where appropriate, working with ecologists
and horticultural/arboricultural experts.
18.8 PHYSICAL SPECIFICATIONS
18.8.1 Pre-treatment and inlets
Inlets need to be designed to allow water to run onto the surface of the filter medium without causing
scour or damage to vegetation and so that inflows are uniformly distributed over the filter surface area
to maximise treatment potential. They should also have minimal risk of blockage. They need sufficient
hydraulic capacity, and this should be confirmed by the usual analysis methods (Chapter 28). For simple
rain gardens the inlet is often just a surface channel lined with granite sets or any other shallow channel
construction that fits the landscape design. A forebay is not normally provided in simple small systems
where sediment loads are low.
For bioretention systems draining roads or larger areas, the systems can be either on-line or off-line, and
can have specific point inlets or over-the-edge flow into the system as shown in Figure 18.10. Kerb cuts
are the best form of inlet from roads and other surfaces and should be at least 500 mm wide to minimise
the risk of blockage with a large radius to the upstream kerb to promote flow into the system. They should
include erosion protection downstream to dissipate energy. For larger systems or where sediment loads
are high, a sediment forebay should be provided to trap sediment in an easily accessible area otherwise
silt will tend to collect around the inlet, gradually extending into and blinding the surface of the filter.
Forebays should be unobtrusive and appropriate to the size and design of the bioretention system. An
area of dense vegetation at the inlet can also help with sediment management.

Pre-treatment is usually only required for high sediment or gross pollutants loadings (ie not roof runoff).
This can be achieved using a filter strip, gravel strip or two-cell design that has a forebay from which
sediment can be easily removed (Equation 18.2). An alternative to a forebay for larger systems is to
provide an inlet pond (effectively a submerged forebay) (Figure 18.12).

EQ.
18.2
Forebay design
If a forebay is provided, it can be sized following the guidance from Water by Design (2012). The
forebay should remove 80% of particles that are greater than 1 mm diameter from the water quality
design event (Chapter 4) and provide sufficient storage for the coarse sediment to build up between
maintenance events. The forebay should also provide energy dissipation of the incoming flows.
Forebays should be separate from the filter medium and should not be constructed over it.
The volume of the forebay is determined using the following equation:
where:
V
s = volume of forebay sediment storage required (m3)
A
c = contributing catchment area (ha)
R capture efficiency (0. recommended)
L0 = sediment loading rate (m3/ha/year) (for example guidance see Wilson et al, 2004)
F
c = desired clean-out frequency (years)
The area of the forebay is determined using the following equation which is modified from Fair and
Gayer (1954):
where:
R = fraction of target sediment removed (0.8 recommended)
V
s = settling velocity of target sediment (0.1 m/s for 1 mm particle)
Q 11 year, critical duration flow rate (m3/s)
Af = minimum forebay area for sediment capture (m2)
n = turbulence or short-circuiting parameter (0.5 recommended)
The depth is determined by dividing the volume by the area and should not be greater than 300 mm.
For smaller forebays less than 10 m2
, the depth should not exceed 200 mm. Note that to prevent
resuspension of sediment and minimise the frequency of maintenance, the design may be based
on a higher return period event, especially if the system is designed to also provide attenuation for
these events.
18.8.2 Underdrains and outlets
Underdrains and outlets should be designed using conventional hydraulic design methods to ensure
that the system can carry away the filtering water and to ensure that the overlying soils do not become
saturated (the underdrains should have a hydraulic capacity exceeding that of the surrounding soils).
The following need to be checked:
a) perforations in the pipe are adequate to pass the maximum filtration rate (using orifice equations
Section 28.5.2)
b) the pipe has sufficient capacity to convey the design flows (this component should be oversied to
ensure that it does not become a choke in the system)
c) material in the drainage layer will not wash into the perforated pipes – a useful guide is to check
that the D85 (85th percentile particle size) of the drainage layer is greater than the pipe perforation
diameter (FAWB, 2009).
Chapter 18: Bioretention systems
347
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
The underdrains should be connected to a positive outflow and should be constructed using slotted pipes
or geocellular units. Underdrains are not always required if the system is allowing water to infiltrate into
the ground (this will depend on the infiltration capacity of the soils and the risks of system clogging), but
where they are used they should be connected to an outfall.
If the design objective for the underdrain is to collect all the filtered water, the bottom of the system can
be shaped to define a flow path towards the underdrain (Figure 18.14). However, if the goal is to facilitate
infiltration, then the base should be flat (particularly where the underdrain pipe is raised above the base).
Figure 18.14 Shaping the bottom of a system
For simple rain gardens taking roof water, where there is no underdrain, a simple outfall is required.
Variations of the simple protected orifice flow control, as shown in Figure 18.15, have been used
successfully in the UK.
Figure 18.15 Outfall from simple rain garden (courtesy EPG and Illman Young)
For most systems, an overflow structure and non-erosive overflow channel should be provided to safely
pass flows in excess of the bioretention storage capacity to the downstream drainage system. This should
be sied to convey the overflow event, and can often be a small 150 mm diameter pipe. It should be set at
the required height to operate when the overflow event occurs. The overflow outlet should generally be as
close as possible to the inlet so that the flow path across the surface of the filter medium is minimised for
larger flows (Figures 18.16 and 18.17). However, for smaller retrofit systems this is not always possible,
especially if using existing drainage gullies as the overflow.

Overflow systems/routes are also required
where the flow capacity of a bioretention
system is exceeded these should generally
be located at the downstream end, but they
may need to be staggered along the system
depending on the length of the component.
Inspection pipes should be provided to
underdrains to provide access for cleaning
and monitoring.
Outlet structures are discussed in more
detail in Chapter 28.

18.9 MATERIALS
18.9.1 Mulch layer (if required)
The use of an organic mulch should generally be avoided for systems where there is an overflow pit,
owing to the risk of clogging. In the case of infiltration systems (with no overflow), a mulch may be
used, but there is still a risk of excessive movement of material during high flows. A mulch layer (with a
maximum depth of 75 mm) can be spread over the bioretention area to retain some soil moisture. Organic
matting that degrades within six months, bonded fibre matric mulches or a layer of gravel can be used
as an alternative to standard organic mulches. A gravel mulch may be valuable where there is a need to
protect the soil from erosion or decrease the drop to the water storage zone (for safety reasons), while
still maintaining an acceptable ponding volume; however, high planting densities should be used, to
compensate for the reduced spread of plants.
The best performance and prevention of erosion is likely to be achieved by using plants that give good
ground cover rather than a mulch.
18.9.2 Filter media
The filter medium should be sufficiently permeable to allow water to pass through it, so that the surface of
the retention area does not become waterlogged. It also needs to contain sufficient organic material and
plant nutrients to support the proposed vegetation.
Filter media should be correctly specified. An indicative specification is provided in Box 18.1, but others
are available, and any specification should take into account site-specific requirements and constraints.
If alternative specifications are used, the specification parameters should be clearly stated, so that in
the event that a supplier ceases trading the filter material can still be replaced on a like-for-like basis.
Note that this is a different specification from tree soil, and if trees are being planted in the system a soil
scientist or arboriculturist should be consulted on the most appropriate specification for the system.
Incorrect specification can cause reduced hydraulic conductivity through over-compaction or structural
collapse, leading to reduction in treatment capacity and surface ponding, loss of vegetation etc. The filter
medium should also be correctly installed with an appropriate level of compaction during installation to
prevent migration of fine particles.
A filter medium that is placed uncompacted will initially show a very high hydraulic conductivity which
will then rapidly decrease. So it is essential that testing of hydraulic conductivity be carried out on the
compacted filter medium before installation.
BOX
18.1

Saturated hydraulic conductivity (permeability)
The saturated hydraulic conductivity should be between 100 mm/h and 300 mm/h. This should be
checked in situ, using the single ring infiltration test method as described in BS EN ISO 2222-52012.
(Note that where larger volumes of engineered soil are to be used, it is wise to test the hydraulic
conductivity before delivery to site using a laboratory test. ASTM F1815-06 is commonly used in
other applications such as sports pitches.)

The total porosity should be > 30% when tested in accordance with BS 1377-2:1990).

material will have a suitable hydraulic conductivity. However, the grading in Table 18.2 provides
a useful guide for selecting an appropriate material. The grading needs to be readily understood
by both drainage and landscape/horticultural professionals, and each use a different standard
format for presenting grading information. The grading in Table 18.2 is presented in a standard
engineering format.

The specification could also be presented as follows (which may be more relevant to landscape
practitioners):

fine sand (0.060.2 mm) 20
medium sand (0.2–0.6 mm) 35% to 65%
coarse sand (0.60–2.0 mm) 50% to 60%

The filter medium should be well-graded, and the composition should contain limited particle sie
range.
Organic matter content
Organic matter content should be 3–5% (w/w).

pH should be 5.5.5 (12.5 soil/water extract)
Electrical conductivity (salinity)

Major plant nutrients
Total nitrogen should be 0.10–0.30%
Extractable phosphorus should be 16100 mg/l
Extractable potassium should be 120900 mg/l
(Methods of analysis in accordance with BS 3882:2015, unless otherwise stated.)
Horticultural assessment
Potential bioretention soils and test results should generally be assessed by a horticulturalist to
ensure that they are capable of supporting a healthy vegetation community. This assessment should
take into consideration delivery of nutrients to the system by surface water runoff. Any component
or soil found to contain high levels of salt (as determined by EC measurements), high levels of clay
or silt particles (exceeding the particle sie limits set above), or any other extremes which may be
considered retardant to plant growth should be rejected.
Chapter 18: Bioretention systems
351
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
For simple rain gardens draining a small area of roof (< 20 m2) the filter medium could be substituted by a
200–500 mm layer of engineered soil (Section 30.4.2) below the base, or, if the native soil is good quality
subsoil, then an amended soil could be used comprising 55 sand, 0 existing soil, 15 compost.
The material should be well mixed and should meet the permeability requirements specified in the
bioretention and engineered soil specifications.
18.9.3 Transition layer or geotextile separator layer
The transition layer should be specified based on the geotechnical filter criteria described in Chapter 30,
taking account of the grading of the filter medium and the drainage layer. The filter criteria ensure that soil
particles cannot be washed from one layer to another. Alternatively a geotextile separator may be used,
which should meet the geotextile filter criteria (Chapter 30).
18.9.4 Drainage layer
The drainage layer should be much more permeable than the filter medium. There are various materials
that can meet this requirement and may be suitable as the drainage layer:
filter drain materials see Section 30.4.1
sub-base materials used below pervious surfaces, such as 4/20 aggregate – see Chapter 20
geocellular units – see Chapter 21
Materials such as crushed recycled concrete may be appropriate for the drainage layer, but they should
not contain any fine particles that could wash out of the drainage layer, contaminating runoff and
potentially blocking underdrain pipework. Crushed concrete should also be tested to make sure that it will
not leach contaminants into the water.
18.10 LANDSCAPE DESIGN AND PLANTING
Plant selection will be dependent on design aspirations for the site. Planting in a bioretention system
provides volumetric reduction of runoff, pollutant uptake through the soil and physical and chemical
processes in the soil. Plants also affect the long-term hydraulic conductivity of the filter medium and help
prevent erosion. The type of plants used in a bioretention system affects the system performance. The
main criteria for plant selection are:
surrounding landscape characteristics
whether native or introduced species are appropriate
availability of plants from local nurseries
drought tolerance capable of surviving extended dry periods
tolerance of free-draining sandy soil
tolerance of occasional inundation
tolerance of expected pollution loads
fibrous root structure propensity
spreading growth form rather than clumping propensity.
Consideration should also be given to shade tolerance and height restrictions (eg for sight lines next to
highways). The level of maintenance that plants will require is also an important consideration. Guidance
on suitable plants for the UK is provided by the Bray et al (2012) but the choice is site specific and requires
input from a landscape architect or other horticultural professional. Plant lists can lead to uniform standard
design solutions and discourage creative site specific design, so plant lists are not provided in this manual.
352 Part D: Technical detail
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
In general, the same considerations apply for bioretention areas as for swales, and the choice of planting
should recognise that different areas in the facility will be subject to different saturation levels. The side
slopes will generally be dry for most of the time, whereas the base is well drained but will be subject to
varying moisture content and saturation.
Two specific types of planting areas can be differentiated as follows
a) Ornamental planting areas – these can also act as a bioretention areas where aesthetics are of key
importance. If ornamental planting is applied, the retention area should be considered as a mass bed
planting, so that foliage will cover the entire area at the end of the second growing season. A variety of
species should be used to give interest all year round, with perennials giving colour from spring to autumn
and ornamental grasses and evergreen or berry-producing shrubs ensuring that the area remains
visually acceptable during the winter. Low maintenance ornamental species are most appropriate.
b) en sae meaos these areas can be used for bioretention, and tend to have significantly
reduced maintenance requirements. The planting used in this case tends to be a variety of native
grasses interlaced with selections of wildflowers.

Chapter 18: Bioretention systems
353
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Whatever planting is specified, the following aspects are important in successful establishment of the
bioretention system or rain garden.
Dense planting is necessary (typically in the order of 6–10 plants/m2 (although this will be species
specific). This increases root densities, which helps to maintain surface permeability.
In larger systems, consider zoning, with areas away from inlets having different species that need to
be more hardy.
Shrubs are very effective plants in bioretention systems because of their moderately fibrous root system
and large root biomass. They can provide dense vegetative barriers to deter public access if needed,
and reduce weeds. A minimum of three types of shrubs should be used to give diversity, which protects
against pests and disease. Herbaceous ground cover should be provided if the site conditions are
suitable (at least three or four species) because it has fibrous roots, is fast growing and is effective at
removing pollutants. Turf is not recommended because of limited tolerance to dry periods.
Provide a range of growth forms where possible.
A typical planting layout is shown in Figure 18.20.
Figure 18.20 Typical planting layout
The batters or side slopes around bioretention systems should have at least 200 mm of topsoil on them.
The topsoil should meet the requirements of BS 3882:2015.
Where trees are included in bioretention systems, they should not be provided with irrigation pipes that
extend into the filter medium. This is because the pipes will allow water to short-circuit the filter and will
reduce the effectiveness of the system. If trees stakes are used to support the trees they should be removed
when no longer required and the holes filled in with filter medium (again to avoid short-circuiting).
Further information on landscape and planting best practice is presented in Chapter 29.
18.11 CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS
Bioretention areas should ideally be constructed at the end of development, to minimise erosion and
sediment generation, and a dense and vigorous vegetative cover should be established over the
contributing pervious catchment area before runoff is accepted into the facility. If this is impractical,
354 Part D: Technical detail
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
bioretention areas should be protected from runoff by using silt fences or straw bales as recommended in
Woods Ballard et al (2007).
In Australia there has been a significant issue with bioretention blinding, compaction and failure during
the site construction phase. One approach to address this is to place the filter medium in the system
and cover it with a temporary impermeable cover to collect all the silt and sediment that is washed into
the depression during construction (ie the system is acting as a silt basin during construction). This
impermeable layer and accumulated silt is removed once construction is completed and the system is
planted. Relying on sediment fences and straw bales has not been found to be as effective as protecting
the systems with a temporary cover.
To minimise the risk of premature system failure, the following points should be closely monitored during
the construction of bioretention areas:
Care should be taken not to over-compact the soils below the bioretention area, and particularly the
filter and soil planting bed, as this will reduce infiltration capacities.
To excavate a bioretention area, a backhoe excavator should be used, and construction plant should
avoid running over the bioretention area. For smaller systems and rain gardens, hand excavation
may be more suitable if access is limited.
If mulch is required, it should be applied before planting. It should not be piled up around plants, as
this will cause disease and encourage pests. It should be 50–75 mm thick and should be kept clear
of plant stems by 50 mm to prevent excessive moisture around the stems.
Care should be taken to ensure that geotextiles are not clogged or torn during construction.
The filter medium should not be placed if it is saturated or if the ground below the system is saturated.
The filter medium should be tested to ensure that it meets the required criteria before placing (Box 18.1).
It is important to establish the planting in the systems as quickly as possible. Watering, weeding and
replanting will be required during the establishment period to ensure that greater than 90% of plants
survive and give good cover.
The surface of the filter medium should be free of localised depressions so that water is distributed evenly
across the surface and prevents localised ponding and clogging. The surface levels should be within a
tolerance of ± 25 mm for smaller systems and ± 40 mm for systems with an area greater than 300 m2. The
thicknesses for the various layers should be constructed with a tolerance of + 25 mm (ie they should not
be less than the design thickness). Levels around the edge of the system should be within ± 25 mm of
design levels.
Further detail on construction activities and the programming of construction activities is provided in
Chapter 31.
A construction phase health and safety plan is required under the Construction (Design and
Management) Regulations (CDM) 2015. This should ensure that all construction risks have been
identified, eliminated, reduced and/or controlled where appropriate.
Generic health and safety guidance is presented in Chapter 36.
18.12 OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS
Dalrymple (201) concluded that bioretention systems will typically require approximately 2.5 times more
maintenance than typical landscape designs. Bioretention systems will require regular maintenance to
ensure continuing operation to design performance standards, and all designers should provide detailed
specifications and frequencies for the required maintenance activities along with likely machinery
requirements and typical annual costs – within the Maintenance Plan. The treatment performance of
bioretention systems is dependent on maintenance, and robust management plans will be required to
Chapter 18: Bioretention systems
355
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
ensure that maintenance is carried out in the long term. Different designs will have different operation
and maintenance requirements, but this section gives some generic guidance. Ease of access for
maintenance and inspection is essential.
The main cause of failure of bioretention systems is clogging of the surface, which is easily visible.
Underdrains and drainage layers are beneath the ground, and malfunctioning is not so easy to detect
and therefore could potentially be ignored. However, the results of any malfunction are likely to cause
surface ponding. The clogging of the surface or drainage layers can cause poor outflow water quality due
to water bypassing the filter medium to the overflow more frequently than allowed for. During the first few
months after installation, the system should be visually inspected after rainfall events, and the amount of
deposition measured, to give the operator an idea of the expected rate of sediment deposition. After this
initial period, systems should be inspected each quarter, to verify the appropriate level of maintenance.
Further detail on waste management is provided in Chapter 33.
Adequate access should be provided for all bioretention areas for inspection and maintenance, including
for the appropriate equipment and vehicles.
Litter picking should be frequent, as rubbish is detrimental to the visual appearance of bioretention
systems. Frequent street sweeping in the catchment area will increase the time interval between cleaning
out forebays or the filter surface and will reduce the loading of fine suspended solids that can potentially
clog the filter medium.
All vegetation management activities should take account of the need to maximise biosecurity and
prevent the spread of invasive species.
Maintenance responsibility for all systems should be placed with an appropriate organisation, and
Maintenance Plans and schedules should be developed during the design phase. Table 18.3 provides
guidance on the type of operation and maintenance schedule that may be appropriate. The list of actions
is not exhaustive and some actions may not always be required. The most intensive maintenance is
required during the establishment period. Herbicides and pesticides (such as Roundup) and fertilizers
should not be used on bioretention systems. This is because these pollutants will wash through the
system quite easily.
Sediments excavated from pre-treatment devices that receive runoff from residential or standard road and
roof areas are generally not toxic or haardous material and can therefore be safely disposed of by either
land application or landfilling. However, consultation should take place with the environmental regulator to
confirm appropriate protocols. Sediment testing may be required before sediment excavation, to determine
its classification and appropriate disposal methods. For industrial site runoff, sediment testing will be
essential. In the majority of cases, it will be acceptable to distribute the sediment on site, if there is an
appropriate safe and acceptable location to do so. Proper disposal of sediment and debris removed must
be ensured, and the environmental regulator should be approached for advice where there are any doubts
concerning disposal options.
Further detail on waste management is given in Chapter 33.
Specific maintenance needs of the bioretention area should be monitored, and maintenance schedules
adjusted to suit requirements.
Further detail on the preparation of maintenance specifications and schedules of work is given in
Chapter 32.
In general, the maintenance for bioretention areas can often be undertaken as part of routine landscape
maintenance.
CDM 2015 requires designers to ensure that all maintenance risks have been identified, eliminated,
reduced and/or controlled where appropriate. This information will be required as part of the health and
safety file.

19Chapter Trees
This chapter provides guidance on the design of SuDS schemes that
use trees. This chapter does not provide guidance on the wider issues of
using trees in urban planning and design.
Appendix Section demonstrates how to design an infiltration treee pit for a
civic street.
19.1 GENERAL DESCRIPTION
Trees can help protect and enhance the urban environment in a number of important
ways (Figure 19.1). This includes:
contributing to effective surface water management strategies
adding beauty and character to the urban landscape, which in turn helps to
improve the health and wellbeing of local communities, and raise the value of
residential and commercial areas
reducing annual building energy consumption by moderating the local climate –
that is, keeping it cooler in summer and warmer in winter
filtering harmful pollutants from the air
masking and reducing unwanted noise
creating vital wildlife habitats, enabling more species to thrive in the urban
environment
helping to slow down cars (trees can be used as an alternative to bollards and speed
bumps or to reinforce the presence and enhance the role of a central reservation)
providing a source of food
absorbing and storing atmospheric carbon dioxide (carbon sequestration).
Trees and their planting structures provide benefits to surface water management in the
following ways:
Transpiration – This is the process by which water, taken in from the soil by tree
roots, is evaporated through the pores or stomata on the surface of leaves (Nisbet,
2005). Trees draw large quantities of water from the soil, which can contribute to
reducing runoff volumes (Box 19.1).
Interception – Leaves, branches and trunk surfaces intercept (store and allow the
water to evaporate) and absorb rainfall, reducing the amount of water that reaches
the ground, delaying the onset and reducing the volume of runoff (Box 19.1).
Inrease infiltration Root growth and decomposition increase soil infiltration
capacity and rate, reducing runoff volumes.
Phytoremediation – In the process of drawing water from the soil, trees also take
up trace amounts of harmful chemicals, including metals, organic compounds,
fuels and solvents that are present in the soil. Inside the tree, these chemicals can
be transformed into less harmful substances, used as nutrients and/or stored in
roots, stems and leaves.

rees an runoff olume reution
A study in the USA (Geiger, 2002) found that tree canopy Interception storage is usually filled after
about 10 minutes. The amount of canopy Interception provided by trees is influenced by rainfall
intensity, storm duration, sunlight, temperature, humidity, wind speed and the species of tree.
Nisbet (2005) reports that studies in the UK have found that 25–45% of annual rainfall is typically
taken up by Interception from conifer stands, compared with 10–25% for broadleaves (Calder et al,
2003). Transpiration rates, on the other hand, vary little between the two forest types, with annual
losses mainly falling within a relatively narrow range of 300–350 mm (Roberts, 1983). Research
in southern England, however, has found higher annual transpiration losses for broadleaves of
360–390 mm (Harding et al, 1992). Therefore, if both Interception and transpiration are considered
together, and assuming an annual rainfall of 1000 mm, conifers could be expected to use some
550–800 mm of water compared with 400–640 mm for broadleaves. Preliminary research results
from the University of Manchester indicate that trees can reduce runoff by as much as 80%
compared to asphalt (Armson et al, 2011).
Trees can be planted within a range of infiltration SuDS components (eg bioretention systems, detention
basins, swales) to improve their performance, or they can be used as standalone features within soil-filled
tree pits, tree planters or structural soils (Figure 19.3).
Tree pits and planters can be designed to collect and attenuate runoff by providing additional storage
within the underlying structure. The soils around trees can also be used to filter out pollutants from runoff
directly. This chapter is concerned specifically with the use of trees in planting beds, pits, structural soils
below pavements and similar structures as part of the surface water management system.
Comprehensive information on the design of trees in hard landscapes, including as part of SuDS, is
provided by TDAG (2014).

19.2 GENERAL DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS
Trees are only intended to manage surface water runoff from the local area (typically a similar area that
would drain to a single road gulley). They should not be used to manage large volumes of water that have
been collected via numerous gullies and/or channels within a large sub-catchment.
Trees require sufficient space, appropriate soil, sufficient gas exchange, adequate drainage and a supply
of water. Soil properties and soil volume are vital for growing trees in urban landscapes and using them
successfully as a means of managing runoff. More detailed guidance is provided by TDAG (2014) and
in BS 8545:2014. The key is to consider rooting volume early in the design process so that it can be
provided cost effectively.
Any tree pit or planter should provide adequate rootable soil volume and appropriate levels of water and
air availability to the roots so as not to inhibit tree growth. These factors are influenced by a soil’s porosity
(amount of available pore space), permeability (how interconnected pore spaces are) and infiltration
rate (how quickly the water moves through the soil). Roots also require sufficient organic material
and nutrients within the soil, and require suitable drainage so that they do not become waterlogged.
There is a balancing act between providing enough water for the trees’ needs and preventing the soils
becoming saturated. This is achieved by ensuring that water storage is below the rootable soil volume
for the majority of the time (occasional inundation of roots may be acceptable – seek the advice of an
arboriculturalist) and allowing water to flow freely below the whole area of rootable soil.
The availability of a sufficient water supply to the tree is crucial. Blunt (200) suggested that in a dry year
trees greater than 15 m height required 60–150 m3 of water from the soil during the growing season. The
largest tree took 240 m3 and a small 10 m high birch took 30 m3. It is, therefore, important to ensure that
the runoff area draining to the tree will provide sufficient water for when it is fully grown. This needs to
take into account the likely rainfall during the growing season, the storage capacity within the soil rooting
volume, the rate of evaporation from the soil and the risk of dry years.
Designing the tree planting zone to accommodate the largest size tree possible will increase its capacity
to manage runoff. Mature, large species trees with their large, dense canopies manage the most surface
water runoff, and should be considered where the location is appropriate. Big trees require large volumes of
suitable soil and above-ground space to grow. If too little soil is available, the tree will not reach full stature,
regardless of what species of tree is planted. Poorly designed sites – those lacking adequate soil and space
– generally require continuous, costly plant healthcare and often continual replacement of trees.
Guidance on appropriate soil volumes is provided in Section 19.8.2.
It is important to consider the likely tree rooting characteristics of proposed trees to ensure tree viability
and stability in the urban environment. Detailed guidance is provide in Crow (2005), which notes in
364 Part D: Technical detail
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
particular that tree roots do not occur in significant quantities at substantial depths (eg 2 m) in the
soil profile (typically 9099 of a tree’s total root length occurs in the upper 1 m of soil). Guidance on
designing building foundations near trees is provided in Chapter 4.2 of NHBC (2014).
Trees for SuDS will tend to be located in an urban environment, and street trees in particular can be
subject to conditions that make it difficult for them to thrive. The main risks are soil compaction by
vehicles and limited access to air and water for the roots.
There are various engineering structures that can be used to improve growing conditions for urban
trees by expanding the rooting environment as much as possible beneath paved surfaces using load-
bearing systems to avoid soil compaction around the roots (TDAG, 2014). These are discussed in the
subsections below.
Figure 19.5 Properties of a tree system draining surface water from a road highway (after TDAG, 2014)
The acceptability of infiltration from a tree pit should be determined by following the guidance provided
in Section 25.2, complying with all relevant requirements for infiltration systems with respect to ground
stability, depth to water table etc and Section 26.7 with respect to the protection of groundwater. The
maximum likely groundwater level should always be at least 1 m below the lowest level of the tree pit,
where infiltration can occur.
Health and safety risk management design guidance is provided in Chapter 36.

19.2.1 Structural growing media
Structural growing media refers to a group of soil-and-gravel mixes that are designed to support tree
growth and serve as a sub-base for pavements. Structural growing media are highly porous, engineered
aggregate mixes designed to be used under asphalt and concrete pavements as the load-bearing and
levelling layer.
The three main types of structural growing media are as follows:
Sanase sustrates also non as tree soils – These comprise predominantly medium to coarse
sand (0.22 mm) which is usually blended with a fine-grade green compost (providing an organic matter
content of 2–4%) and 2–4% clay to add suitable water and nutrient retention properties. An example of this
type of growing medium is the Amsterdam Tree Soil. More recently, variations have been developed that
include a higher proportion of coarser sands to provide more air voids after compaction (eg Rotterdam Tree
Soil). Mixes using recycled glass are also available. Their use is limited to untrafficked paved areas such as
pedestrian areas with no vehicles and cycle tracks, where high levels of compaction are not required.
Medium-sized aggregate substrates – This uses a mix of angular aggregate that can be compacted
to 95% of maximum dry density while still retaining void space between the angular particles. The void
space is filled with soil. The coarse aggregate particles form a matrix that supports and distributes
the loads from vehicles. This prevents compaction of the finer tree soil in which tree roots can grow,
and prevents heaving of the pavement around the tree. There are many variations of the aggregate/
soil mix but typically the aggregate will be 25–100 mm diameter and the proportion of soil is around
20–35%. Because the load-bearing capacity of the aggregate depends on the strength and durability
of the particles, it is recommended that, where it is used below trafficked areas, it meets the durability
and particle shape requirements for sub-base used below pervious surfaces (Chapter 20). The soil
element can be various mixes of clay, sand and compost. This type of substrate can be used below lightly
trafficked areas such as car parks.
Stone seleton sustrates – Also known as the Stockholm system (Figure 19.7), this is similar to the
medium-sized aggregate substrates but uses larger aggregate particles in a base layer of 100–150 mm.
The base layer is covered by a layer of 63–90 mm aggregate. The aggregates are compacted and soil
flushed into the spaces between the larger particles. The system is provided with inlets that allow surface
water and air to freely enter the substrate. The system can support heavier traffic loads than the above
systems, for example HGVs and buses.

It should be noted that the medium-sized aggregate and the stone skeleton substrates typically only have
10–25% void space to support root growth and accommodate surface water runoff. Designers should
therefore take care to ensure that each tree has sufficient volume of growing medium for its lifespan.
366 Part D: Technical detail
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Trees are sensitive to pH (acidity or alkalinity) and pH can significantly affect the life and health of a tree
and its ability to absorb nutrients. When using structural growing media, the pH of the soil and water
will be influenced by the type of aggregate used in the mix, and tree species should be used that are
compatible with the pH of the growing environment and the structural growing medium (Section 19.9.2).
19.2.2 Modular structures
Modular structures, referred to as “crate systems” by TDAG (2014), are cuboid plastic, concrete, plastic/
steel or plastic/concrete structures that provide a load-bearing structure into which the substrate is placed
(Figure 19.8). The structure supports the loads from the overlying pavement and prevents compaction of
the substrate. They can be used to support car parks and roads and to prevent compaction of the tree soil
in a similar manner to the course aggregate in a structural growing medium. The structures can provide
a guaranteed volume of soil for the tree roots, an extra volume for surface water runoff attenuation and
structural support to prevent the soil becoming compacted at the surface. They are usually covered with
grilles, and extend below the adjacent hard surfacing.
The load-bearing capacity of the structures and the design requirements will depend on the material from
which they are made. Many of the considerations for geocellular structures will also apply to plastic systems
(Chapter 21). The structural element comprises a small proportion of the overall volume compared to the
aggregate based systems, so there is a greater rootable volume available.

19.2.3 Raft systems
Raft systems provide a planar structural layer that is constructed over the rooting environment. The raft
distributes the concentrated wheel and other loads across a wider area, to prevent damage to the soil
structure and help absorb loads resulting from any required compaction of overlying layers. Also, the raft
allows free movement of oxygen and water to root systems.
There are two types of raft system, as follows.
ellular onfinement systems – These are also referred to as geocells, which should not be
confused with large-scale geocells constructed using geogrids below embankments or anti-
compaction mats. These are a series of HDPE strips that are opened up and pinned to provide
a series of honeycomb-shaped cells that are filled with coarse aggregate (typically 0 mm or
20–40 mm) to promote free air and water exchange with the soils below (Figure 19.9). These have
been widely used in the construction of unsurfaced roads and for roads and rail tracks across weak
ground since the late 1970s, and they are normally designed following guidance provided by the US
Army Corp of Engineers (USACE). Other more rigorous analysis methods are being developed, but
they have not gained wide acceptance at the present time.
eoellular suase relaement systems – These are geocellular units that have joints that
provide a structural connection so that the system acts as a raft to distribute load (Figure 19.10).
Chapter 19: Trees
367
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
The units can be filled with soil to provide a rooting environment, and they have been used on
several schemes in the Netherlands for this purpose.
Further advice on geocellular systems is provided in Chapter 21.
Either of these systems can be designed to support traffic loads from any road-going vehicles in the UK
including below highways (subject to approval from the highway authority).
The main concern with either of these systems is access to buried utilities, and accidental excavation.
They should be used in appropriate situations with due regard to the presence of services.

19.2.4 Tree planters
Tree planters are essentially bioretention systems (Chapter 18) with trees in them, to enhance their
capacity and performance, and/or to deliver amenity and biodiversity benefits. They have similar
functionality and design requirements to standard tree pits, but have an open surface and generally a
larger surface area, so their overall appearance is different.

368 Part D: Technical detail
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Where the sensitivity and/or vulnerability of groundwater lying beneath a tree means that infiltration
from contaminated surface runoff should be prevented, tree pits/planters etc should be designed with an
impermeable geomembrane liner and positive drainage system to prevent waterlogging.
Health and safety risk management design guidance is provided in Chapter 36.
The inclusion or retention of trees in central reservations or on footways sometimes gives rise to safety
concerns, and consideration should always be given to ensuring that sight lines are not put at risk by tree
planting proposals. Any protective surface grilles or other protection overlying tree pits should be designed to
minimise the risk of damage by potential transient loadings – which could cause trip hazards for pedestrians.
19.3 SELECTION AND SITING OF TREES
Suitable trees should be chosen on a site-by-site basis, based on the constraints and opportunities
afforded by a particular location, and to achieve optimum delivery of hydraulic, water quality, amenity and
biodiversity objectives. A landscape architect should advise on the most appropriate trees for a particular
development scenario that are suitable for:
(a) the likely runoff characteristics (flow rates, volumes and likely contaminants)
(b) the nature of the soil into which it is to be planted
(c) the location and characteristics of the planting site (eg narrow canopy trees may be required for
street locations).
The principles of tree selection are presented in TDAG (2014).
The following characteristics tend to increase the effectiveness of trees in reducing surface water runoff
and filtering pollutants (note that not all are complementary) (CRWA, 2009)
widespreading and dense canopies
long life expectancies
fast growing rates
high tolerance to summer drought
tolerance of saturated soils
resistance to air and water pollutants common in urban environments
extensive root systems
rough bark
tomentose or dull foliage surface
vertical branching structures.
Road salt is the most commonly used de-icing chemical in the UK. It is crushed rock salt, and the main
component is sodium chloride. Both sodium and chloride ions can be harmful to some trees if there are
excessive quantities in the soil. Salt damage occurs to trees through contamination of the soil around
roots or by salt spray. Salt spray is much more likely on roads with fast-moving traffic, such as motorways
and trunk roads. It is likely to be less of a problem where vehicles are moving at low speeds, such as
car parks and minor roads. In medium/high permeability soils such as sands and gravels (where the
residence time of the water in the soil around the tree roots is low), the risk of the salt negatively affecting
the tree is low. Also, trees generally take up less water in winter, and so if exposed to only a few instances
of chloride-contaminated water the effects are likely to be minimal. Furthermore, the amount of salt
applied to roads across the UK has reduced over recent years owing to generally milder winters and more
targeted gritting. An arboriculturist should be consulted to choose appropriate species that are tolerant of
salt if it considered likely that salt in runoff will adversely affect tree health.
Chapter 19: Trees
369
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Further advice is provided by Forest Research (2011).
It is important to locate tree pits at a reasonable distance from buried utility services such as electric
cable and water pipes. Trenching works to repair the services can cut tree roots, and equally tree roots
can damage utility infrastructure. There is no specific minimum distance (although utility providers may
set required distances) and it will depend on the nature of the service, its resistance to movement and
damage caused by trees and the consequence of any damage. However, the risk of damage can be
minimised by installing root barriers around the rootable volume of soil (note that these can often be as
simple as using standard large manhole rings, or geotextile fabrics specifically designed as root barriers).
Underground utilities can be placed around and even through tree pits, geocellular crate systems and
suspended pavement systems. However, all underground utilities should be protected from water and root
penetration.
Detailed guidance is provided in BS 5837:2012.
19.4 HYDRAULIC DESIGN
19.4.1 General
There may be opportunities for infiltration from tree pits, even in city centre environments, and it is usually
worthwhile undertaking infiltration testing to confirm likely infiltration rates.
When structural soil or the tree pit or planter is being used to store surface water runoff before infiltration,
the subsoil may become saturated at times, resulting in lower soil strength. A geotechnical engineer
should be consulted to determine if a separation geotextile or geomembrane is necessary. Lateral flow
through structural soils can also be extremely rapid, and if the sub-base is permeable or has some
permeable areas, throughflow is likely to be fast, which should be taken into account in the design. If
surrounding areas are impermeable, ponding is possible and in such situations overflow and underdrain
outlets are likely to be required to prevent ponded water suffocating trees and to control flood risks
effectively.
Individual trees are likely to be less effective than linked, integrated tree systems in controlling surface
water runoff as the latter provide greater capacity, flexibility and opportunities to convey and utilise
exceedance flows effectively. An integrated tree and green roof system is shown in Figure 19.12.
Figure 19.13 shows a linear tree pit where water can drain through resin bound gravel, below which a
combination of modular crates at each tree pit site and gabions in between allow water to drain along the
linear strip.
19.4.2 Interception design
Interception provided by the tree canopy will vary with tree type and will increase over the life of a tree as
it grows. For the first few years the Interception may be negligible. It is therefore best to ignore this aspect
in the hydraulic design of SuDS, while recognising that it will have a long-term benefit and will reduce
volumetric runoff loads to the surface water system in the future.
Where water is directed towards a tree pit, and the tree pit is designed to facilitate even limited infiltration,
then a check should be made to determine whether the tree is able to dispose of 5 mm rainfall depth over
the contributing catchment area.
Where there is no infiltration, but the natural surface soils (or imported/re-engineered soils) have water
storage capacity, then Interception design should follow the principles set out in Section 24.8.

Chapter 19: Trees
371
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Figure 19.13 Linear tree pit, Leicester (courtesy Leicester City Council)
A flow control structure is generally required to constrain the rate of water discharged from the pit
(Chapter 28). Owing to the small runoff areas likely to be discharging to the pit, it may be appropriate to
link adjacent pits together so that the control system can be larger.
The level of stored water in the tree pit should be such that it will not adversely affect the health of the
tree. Attenuation storage for peak flow control should normally be designed to drain down within hours.
This requirement should also ensure healthy root development (Day et al, 2008). If tree roots are likely to
be inundated for longer than this on a regular basis, then flood tolerant species should be specified.
19.4.4 Volume control design
Contribution of tree pit systems to volume control should be evaluated using standard methods, based on
expected infiltration rates and/or available attenuation storage and specified flow controls. Assessment of
volumetric control should follow the method described in Chapter 3.
eedane o desin
An exceedance flow route will be required with rainfall events that exceed the design capacity of the tree
pits or planters. This can be achieved by installing an overflow pipe above the design water storage level
(Figure 19.15) or by overland flow routing.
The capacity of the overflow(s) should be confirmed using normal hydraulic assessment methods
and analysis (weir, orifice and pipe flow) (Chapter 24). Exceedance flows beyond the capacity of the
overflow(s) should also be reviewed (Section 24.12).
19.5 TREATMENT DESIGN
Tree pits will filter out pollutants from runoff and, by reducing the volume of runoff, will also help to reduce
pollutant loadings to receiving surface waters. Good pollutant removal performance is required for all
runoff events up to and including events which occur, on average, about once a year (termed here the 1:1
year event). The duration of this event should be the relevant critical duration for the runoff to the tree pit.
372 Part D: Technical detail
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
The tree soils can be designed using the same principles as bioretention systems described in Chapter
18. Many trees are able to remove a wide variety of pollutants from soil (USDA, 2006) including metals,
pesticides and organic compounds. Excess nitrogen and phosphorus in soils are quickly taken up by
trees with oxygen-rich rhizospheres, because osmosis can happen freely. Robust resilient trees can
also metabolise contaminants (heavy metals, inorganic and organic compounds) into their carbon-rich
heartwoods, removing them from the runoff.
Hydrocarbons tend to be trapped and degraded in the upper few centimetres of soil. Therefore, their
removal will be more efficient where runoff is directed onto the surface of the soils and where this surface
is well exposed to sunlight. A depth of engineered soil suitable for tree growth has been demonstrated to
remove 70–85% of heavy metal loadings (Xiao and McPherson, 2008).
The acceptability of allowing infiltration from the tree pit will depend on the extent of the likely runoff
contamination and the capability of the filtering soils to remove pollution (see ater ale ). It is
likely to be similar to bioretention systems, provided the design is undertaken in an equivalent way.
19.6 AMENITY DESIGN
To deliver maximum amenity benefits (Section 19.1), the location and type of tree planting should be
planned and designed as a key part of landscape and built environment delivery.
Trees should be selected and planted to maximise their potential delivery of surface water management
objectives, but also so that they have a positive visual impact on the urban environment, with wide-
ranging seasonal interest. The implementation of trees for surface water runoff management should
be integrated with the delivery of green street and green infrastructure strategies, transport (including
walking, cycling and highways) strategies and with the overall urban design strategy.
Canopy sie and tree growth rate have been shown to have a strong influence on the cooling
performance of trees and cooling objectives are best achieved through:
setting canopy cover targets rather than driving design and management decisions on the basis of a
number of trees
providing non-compacted rooting environment(s) of sufficient sie to achieve and sustain the desired
canopy cover target
ensuring a good supply of water, particularly during extended heatwaves (TDAG, 2014).

Performance of trees in removing phosphorous and nitrogen
A study of the nutrient removal performance of bioretention systems planted with trees in Australia
(Denman et al, 2011) found that the inclusion of trees resulted in reductions of soluble nitrogen
and phosphorous compared to unplanted control soils. A mix of deciduous and evergreen trees
was used in the study, and came from a range of climates and environments. The removal of
phosphorous was variable, and improved as the trees became more established over time. A
reduction in concentration of 70–80% was achieved and, once stabilised, there was little difference
in phosphorous removal between soils of different permeability. Nitrogen was produced by the
planted systems during warmer months (output in leachate was greater than input) but overall the
load was reduced and the concentration over time was reduced by 2–78%. The performance of tree
pits in removing nitrogen was better with low hydraulic conductivity soils (4 mm/h) when compared
to the medium and high permeability soils (95 mm/h and 170 mm/h respectively). However, 4 mm/h
is unusually low for a bioretention soil and is likely to cause problems with water filtering through it
in the long term. Tree species was not a significant factor in the performance of the systems with
evergreen and deciduous trees giving similar results even during winter.

CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Trees placed close enough to directly shade
buildings (called shade-effect trees) can lower
summertime energy demand to cool a building.
Care is then required to avoid blocking warm
radiation during winter months, while shading sun-
exposed walls during the summer. At UK latitudes,
this is best achieved by positioning trees along
the west-facing side of a building. Trees located
such that they do not provide shade, but are close
enough to influence the local microclimate, are
termed climate-effect trees. These trees cool the
local microclimate through evapotranspiration,
leading to summertime air-conditioning energy
savings. Climate-effect trees, particularly evergreen
species, can also reduce heat loss from buildings
in winter by reducing wind speed and thus air
infiltration into the building (TDAG, 201).
19.7 BIODIVERSITY DESIGN
Trees can play a critical role in enhancing urban
wildlife. The potential contribution of trees to local
biodiversity strategies and habitat connectivity
should be fully considered. Trees can act as
bridges, maintaining connectivity for species
Figure 19.14 (courtesy Anne Jaluzot)
Popular benches around trees in Norwich
through the urban landscape. Trees support
wildlife in urban environments in many ways, providing food, shelter and habitat for birds, invertebrates
and other species. The selection and mix of tree species will influence the habitat diversity that is
provided. However, it is the canopy volume that is the best predictor of species use, as most animals
require a minimum amount of canopy for survival (TDAG, 2014). A secondary consideration is the spatial
arrangement of the canopy, as some species cannot cross large gaps readily or rely on tree lines for
navigation, as is the case for some bats (Limpens and Kapteyn, 1991).
Strategies to enhance the wildlife benefits associated with trees in hard landscapes include
optimising tree location and planting patterns in the wider landscape context so as to increase
habitat connectivity between vegetated areas, parks, groups of trees etc
creating several layers by using shrubs and smaller trees, such as hazel, among taller trees and
planting the opening of the tree planting hole with ground cover – this will, however, also increase the
demands for water, so higher-density planting should be evaluated carefully to ensure that there is
likely to be sufficient water supply
incorporating nectar and fruit trees within the species selection, while considering the issues
associated with fruit dropping, and the suitability of such species in hard surfaced areas (TDAG, 2014).
Native species are particularly good for supporting wildlife in urban areas. However, building ecological
value and resilience is crucial. Enhancing ecological resilience to diseases and climate change requires a
highly diverse local tree population and the risk of widespread damage can be reduced by diversifying the
gene pool of new trees and by drawing from a wide-ranging planting list featuring both natives and non-
natives suitable to different types of urban settings (TDAG, 2012).
19.8 PHYSICAL SPECIFICATIONS
There are many different types of tree structures available, but the key issues to consider when specifying
tree pits, planters and structural soils are:
374 Part D: Technical detail
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
designing the system so that the system drains water effectively, and the tree roots do not become
waterlogged
designing the system so that compaction of the soils around the tree roots cannot occur
specifying the soil in which the tree roots will grow, to ensure healthy trees
specifying the volume of the tree pit/soil.
The key requirements for tree pits, planters and structural soils are shown in Figure 19.15.
Soi seifiation
This is discussed in Section 19.9.
19.8.2 Soil volumes
Trees need large volumes of soil to allow them to grow to full height and be healthy. Ideally, a tree would be
provided with unlimited soil volume, but this is clearly not practical, although tree soil volumes should be
connected where practical to maximise space availability to roots. Green (2010) suggests that 0.056 m3 of
tree soil is provided for every 0.093 m2 of tree canopy (at the mature height).
McPherson and MacDonagh (2012) summarised the policies of a number of US states and towns and
compared them with the minimum volume suggested by research studies. This research supports
the adoption of minimum rooting volumes for trees at the higher end of the ranges suggested by local
implementation policies. It suggests that trees with 75 cm trunk diameters require at least 40 m3 soil
volume. Smaller diameter trees will need slightly less, but this will be dependent on tree species.
Tree pit manufacturers can provide further guidance on minimum volumes required.

19.8.3 Pre-treatment and inlets
Surface water runoff can be introduced to a tree pit or tree soil in a variety of ways. Conveyance collector
channels or rills can be directed to spill onto the tree soil surface; impermeable surfaces can be sloped
towards the tree pit; or permeable surfaces can be used to collect and convey the runoff in subsurface
media layers. Example layouts are shown in Figure 19.16.
Figure 19.16 Dŵr Cymru Welsh Water)
Examples of inlets to allow surface water runoff to infiltrate into tree pits (courtesy Anne Jaluot and
19.8.4 Outlets
Tree pits need to be well drained. This can be achieved by infiltration to the ground if soil conditions are
suitable. If infiltration is not possible then an outfall to the surface water drainage system will be required.
The outlet should be set at a level to maintain the required maximum water level in the base of the tree
pit. Outlets from the base of tree soils should have a large surface area and will normally comprise
perforated pipes, geocomposites or geocellular units that are connected to pipes.
Where water is allowed to infiltrate into the surrounding soil it should be prevented from flowing into any
adjacent normal sub-base construction below pavements. If the head driving the water is not very great
(eg from a planar area of structural soils) water migration into the adjacent sub-base may not be a big
risk. If the risk is considered unacceptable, water migration to the sub-base should be prevented, for
example using a geomembrane.
19.9 MATERIALS
There are various specifications for structural growing media that have been used successfully around
the world. The specification should take account of local climate and tree species, and guidance should
preferably be sought from an arboriculturist or horticulturalist. When using proprietary products, the
recommendations provided by the manufacturer should always be followed.
19.9.1 Soil for use in modular and raft systems
The main requirements of the soil for use in modular structures and rafts are that:
the texture of the soil should be homogeneous throughout the whole profile there should not be
any great differences between different layers
the soil should be well graded
the soil should have an appropriate humus content (about 5%)
the soil should have a permeability within a sufficient range high enough to drain effectively, but
low enough so that the water is treated as it filters through typically this will be 10000 mm/h.

PSD is of secondary importance compared with saturated hydraulic conductivity. A material whose PSD falls within the
following recommended range does not preclude the need for hydraulic conductivity testing; that is, it does not guarantee
that the material will have a suitable hydraulic conductivity. However, the grading in ale provides a useful guide for
selecting an appropriate material. The grading needs to be readily understood by both drainage and landscape/horticultural
professionals as each uses a different standard format for presenting grading information. The grading in ale is for the
same material specified in ale but presented in a standard engineering format.

19.9.2 Structural growing media
A good structural growing medium will have known water-holding, drainage, structural and load-bearing
characteristics (Day et al, 2008). It should be able to still support plant growth when compacted to 95%
of standard Proctor density. It should also be supported by the results of field trials that demonstrate its
performance. A key requirement is that the materials should be available locally at reasonable cost. An

Mixing
The soil should be mixed using suitable equipment to provide a uniform and consistent material.
The structural soil should not leach pollutants into the surface water.
The type of stone used in the mix (whether limestone, granite, lava rock or other stone) will influence the
pH of the soil and soil water. In systems that incorporate concrete products, the pH will continue to rise
over time as concrete deteriorates. In some cases, the addition of chemicals may be necessary to help
offset pH conditions, if required by the trees selected for the site. These chemicals should be selected
so as to not damage the concrete or other materials. Designs should consider this aspect of long-term
maintenance and try to minimise these effects (TDAG, 2014).
Soils used in tree pits and structural soils should be tested and approved as part of a quality assurance
programme to ensure that materials meeting the specification are used on site. Suggested details are
provided in Box 19.5.
19.10 LANDSCAPE DESIGN AND PLANTING
The inclusion of trees as part of the surface water management strategy requires full integration
with the landscape and architectural design of a new development to ensure that the benefits are
maximised and the trees enhance and support building and landscape performance. The size, species,
characteristics and planting location should be guided by a landscape designer, with advice from an
arboriculturist where required.
Guidance on species selection, planting strategies etc is provided in TDAG (2012, 2014).
Landscape design and planting best practice is presented in detail in Chapter 29.

Testing and approval of tree soils and structural soils
roramme for sourin soil
Sufficient time should be allowed for sourcing and testing the proposed soil(s) to meet the
requirements of the soil specification.
Typically at least four weeks is recommended for sourcing soils, so that the necessary testing can
be undertaken to demonstrate compliance with the specification.
The contractor shall provide soil laboratory test certificates to the contract administrator for review
and approval.
Samlin rotool
The soil(s) to be considered for use should be sampled before placement and preferably while
stockpiled at its source or manufacturer’s location.
The sample(s) shall be representative of the soil to be used. One composite sample shall be taken
for every 500 m3 of each type of soil to be used.
Each composite sample should be made up of o susamles taken from evenly spaced
locations across the stockpile/field. The subsamples shall be mixed together and quartered down to
form a 5 kg composite sample.
Each composite sample shall be placed in a clean, strong plastic bag, each labelled with the source
reference and date of sampling. Other samples may be required in different containers for specific
analyses (eg organics).
Soils of different types should not be mixed to form a composite sample.
Soil testin failities
Soil samples shall be sent to a soil science testing facility (eg UK Accreditation Service (UKAS) and/
or EA Monitoring Certification Scheme (MCERTS) accredited) with a request for each sample to be
analysed in accordance with the schedule provided in the specification.
19.11 CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS
If sediment from construction work accumulates on the exposed surface of a tree pit or planter, it should
be cleared and the pit fully rehabilitated before the drainage system is adopted by the organisation
responsible for carrying out the maintenance.
It is important that the tree soils and structural soils are not damaged by inappropriate handling or
compaction during construction. The soil should be placed when it is non-plastic (friable) in consistency
with a moisture content at least 5 below the soil’s plastic limit. It should not be placed if is froen or
during heavy rainfall.
The tree soil and structural soil should be not be allowed to become mixed with other material such as
sub-base or demolition debris. Handling the soil can destroy its structure, and so multiple handling should
be kept to a minimum. It is vital that once placed, the soil is not compacted by trampling or trafficking by
site machinery.
The use of additional slow release fertilisers in the topsoil may be required (as advised by the tree
specifier) to help tree establishment. The risk of this causing surface water pollution has to be weighed
against the risk of the tree dying, but the use of fertilisers should be avoided wherever possible as they
add nutrient load to the surface water.
Structural soils are load-bearing and form part of the sub-base construction to pavements. They should
be compacted to a suitable density as defined by the pavement designer. Roots can still penetrate the
materials because the density that roots can tolerate is dependent on the particle size distribution of the
soils they are in.

Management) Regulations 2015. This should ensure that all construction risks have been identified,

Generic health and safety guidance is provided in Chapter 36.
19.12 OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS
Maintenance requirements of trees will be greatest during the first few years, when the tree is becoming
established. Early maintenance should involve regular inspection, removal of invasive vegetation and
possibly irrigation during long dry periods, particularly in soils with high void ratios. Tree roots need to
establish good rootsoil contact before they can efficiently extract water from the soil. The expertise
of a arboriculturist/landscape architect with local knowledge should be sought regarding appropriate
irrigation schedules. Maintenance responsibility for a tree pit or planter should always be placed with an
appropriate organisation.
ale provides guidance on the type of operational and maintenance requirements that may be
appropriate. The list of actions is not exhaustive and some actions may not always be required.

Sediments excavated from a tree pit or planter that receive runoff from residential or standard road and
roof areas are generally not toxic or hazardous material and can therefore be safely disposed of by either
land application or landfilling. However, consultation should take place with the environmental regulator to
confirm appropriate protocols. Sediment testing may be required before sediment excavation to determine
its classification and appropriate disposal methods. For runoff, from busy streets with high vehicle traffic
sediment testing will be essential.
Further detail on waste management is provided in Chapter 33.
Maintenance Plans and schedules should be developed during the design phase. Specific maintenance
needs of the tree pits/planters should be monitored and maintenance schedules adjusted to suit
requirements.
Further detail on the preparation of maintenance specifications and schedules of work is given in
Chapter 31.

20.1 GENERAL DESCRIPTION
Pervious pavements provide a pavement suitable for pedestrian and/or vehicular
traffic, while allowing rainwater to infiltrate through the surface and into the underlying
structural layers. The water is temporarily stored beneath the overlying surface before
use, infiltration to the ground, or controlled discharge downstream (Section 20.1.9).
Pervious surfaces, together with their associated substructures, are an efficient means
of managing surface water runoff close to its source intercepting runoff, reducing
the volume and frequency of runoff, and providing a treatment medium. Treatment
processes that occur within the surface structure, the subsurface matrix (including soil
layers where infiltration is allowed) and the geotextile layers include
filtration
adsorption
biodegradation
sedimentation.
There are two types of pervious pavements that are defined on the basis of the
surfacing materials
Porous pavements infiltrate water across their entire surface material, for
example reinforced grass or gravel surfaces, resin bound gravel, porous concrete
and porous asphalt.
Permeable pavements have a surface that is formed of material that is itself
impervious to water. The materials are laid to provide void space through the surface
to the sub-base (eg standard concrete block paving is specifically designed to allow
rainwater falling onto the surface or runoff discharged over the surface to infiltrate
through the joints or voids between the blocks into the underlying pavement structure).
The main types of surfaces used as part of pervious pavement construction are
modular permeable paving
porous asphalt
grass reinforcement
resin bound gravel
porous concrete

These are summarised in Sections 20.1.1 and 20.1.8.
20.1.1 Modular permeable paving
The most common surface is concrete block permeable paving, but other modular surfacing materials
can also be used (clay pavers, natural stone etc).
All types of surface have widened joints filled with grit to allow water into the underlying bedding layer and
sub-base.
Potential uses include
pedestrian areas
private driveways
car parks
lightly to heavily trafficked roads
ports.
The common layout is to use modular permeable pavement for car park spaces and normal asphalt lanes
between (Figure 20.1). This is to reduce costs and also because the asphalt can tolerate turning forces
more effectively. The sub-base storage layer extends below the asphalt.
There are also spacer systems available that allow the use of normal paving slabs as permeable surfaces
(with appropriate free draining joint, bedding and sub-base material). These are best suited to areas with
only pedestrian traffic.

20.1.2 Porous asphalt
Porous asphalt can be used as an independent surface or to provide a stronger base to concrete block
permeable pavements where it is to be trafficked frequently by trucks. Porous asphalt surfacing reduces
traffic noise.

Potential uses include

used for a car park at East Midlands Airport. The
storage below the car park has been increased using

that comply with BS 75-12009.
20.1.3 Grass reinforcement

Grass reinforcement uses plastic or concrete grids
infilled with grass or gravel.
This type of pavement is most suitable for lightly trafficked locations, especially where it only has
seasonal use, so that the grass has time to recover.
Potential uses include
overflow car parks to leisure facilities
schools
private driveways
hotel and office car parks
fire access or other infrequent HGV traffic.
It is important that these systems are well constructed to ensure that the soils are not compacted. The
type of grass needs to suit the local climate.

20.1.4 Resin bound gravel
Resin bound gravel provides a wide range of finish colours, which makes it attractive for use in public,
recreational spaces (Figure 20.6).
This type of pavement is most suitable for lightly trafficked locations.
Potential uses include
schools
pedestrian areas around buildings or precincts
private driveways.

20.1.5 Porous concrete
Porous concrete can be used as a surfacing material or to provide improved structural stability to the
base of concrete block permeable pavements where it is to be trafficked frequently by trucks.
Potential uses include
car parks
lightly trafficked roads.
Figure 20.7 shows a large (200 m2) parking area constructed with porous concrete to meet the
sustainable drainage planning requirements for a new retail development site. The porous concrete
surface has been used in the parking bays, traffic aisles and the access route into this area of parking. In
other parts of the site it has been used only in parking bays with the impermeable asphalt aisles draining
onto the porous concrete.
20.1.6 Macro pervious paving
Macro pervious systems are where normally impermeable surfaces are drained to channels or other
collection systems designed to trap oil and silt.
This approach allows water storage in the sub-base below impermeable surfaces in areas where there
are high traffic loads and/or high shear forces from turning vehicles (Chaddock and Nunn, 2010).
The example of a macro pervious pavement shown in Figures 20.8 and 20.9 uses a treatment channel
to collect runoff, and this discharges to an open-graded blanket of sub-base (the same materials
as used below concrete block permeable paving) or geocellular sub-base replacement below the
390 Part D: Technical detail

impermeable surfacing. Other options for discharge to the drainage layer could be considered such as
via a bioretention system. Whatever approach is used, the main requirement is that robust treatment and
removal of silt is required before discharge into the sub-base.
This type of paving serve for all types of uses, as long as the site is not subject to very high silt loads and
where regular maintenance can be assured.

20.1.7 Sports surfaces
Either aggregate sub-base or plastic sub-base replacement units can be used below turf or porous artificial
surfaces to manage surface water runoff for multi-use games areas, sports pitches and play areas.
These surfaces can be used as part of a water management system where the water is stored for
irrigation or other use. Some systems include passive irrigation where water is lifted up from the storage
layer into the overlying surface by capillary action.

20.1.8 Block porous paving
Concrete (or other recycled materials such as glass) block porous paving relies on water permeating
through the porous paving unit material rather than through widened joints. Experience in the UK
indicates that they are much more prone to clogging than any of the other types of system, due to very
small sie of the voids in the surface of the paving unit. Therefore, their potential use is limited due to this
risk of clogging.
20.1.9 Systems of water management
There are three principal systems of water management below the surface of pervious pavements that
are described in Figures 20.12 to 20.14.
Type A (Figure 20.12) reflects a system where all the rainfall passes into the substructure (where it may
be stored temporarily) from where it infiltrates into the soil beneath. Normally, there will be no discharge
from the system to a sewer or watercourse. However, an emergency overflow may be required to cater for
events in excess of the design event or to allow for the system becoming less efficient (ie infiltration rates
reducing) over its design life.
Figure 20.12 Pervious pavement system types Type A total infiltration
In a Type B system (Figure 20.13), the proportion of the rainfall that exceeds the infiltration capacity
of the subsoils flows to the receiving drainage system. This can occur by direct drainage through the
sub-base or by conveyance via perforated pipes within or below it. Geocomposite blankets can also be
used to collect and convey water below the sub-base layer or can be placed vertically at the edges of the
construction to allow connection to a pipe. By preventing the build-up of water above the subgrade, the
risks to soil stability are reduced.
There is no infiltration with a Type C system (Figure 20.14). The system is generally wrapped in an
impermeable, flexible membrane placed above the subgrade (formation level). Once the water has filtered
through the sub-base, it is conveyed to the outfall via perforated pipes or fin drains. This can be used for
situations where
soils have low permeability or low strength (and could therefore be damaged by the introduction of
infiltrating water)
the water is to be harvested and used
the underlying groundwater is sensitive and requires protection
the water table is within 1 m of the sub-base
the site is contaminated and the risks of mobilising contaminants must be minimised.

Variations of these three basic types of pervious pavement construction include the following
Grass reinforcement systems can be used over standard pavement materials (eg Type 1 sub-base).
These systems will provide Interception, but attenuation and treatment of the residual runoff from the
surface will still be required, as they do not provide for any storage of water in the sub-base.
Impermeable asphalt or concrete surfacing used over permeable sub-base (known as macro
pervious surfaces MPPS, or reservoir pavements) where the water is introduced into the storage in
the sub-base via a series of distinct entry points fast enough to prevent flooding during the design
storm but without allowing silt and debris to enter the sub-base. The system offers the opportunity
to accrue the benefits of a pervious pavement when the use of traditional paving surfaces is the
preferred option due to traffic considerations. The performance of the silt trapping devices is crucial
in this application as it is impossible to subsequently remove silt from the sub-base without complete
system reinstatement. Simple catch pits or normal channels are not suitable.
20.2 GENERAL DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS
There is a range of surfacing materials that can be used to allow water to soak into the underlying sub-
base. The choice of the most appropriate surfacing for a given location is crucial to the successful use of
Chapter 20: Pervious pavements
393
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
pervious pavements to manage surface water. This will mainly be based on the expected traffic loadings
and the visual appearance that is required.
Type C system (Section 20.1.9) designs may be modified to allow a proportion of runoff to be stored
and used for various non-potable applications such as irrigation, toilet flushing etc (Figure 20.15 and
Beecham et al, 2010). Because of the evaporation occurring, the proportion of runoff captured by a
pervious pavement system is lower than from an impermeable surface, and it is recommended that runoff
coefficients of 0 are used for rainwater harvesting design (Interpave, 2010).
For further information on opportunities for using rainwater, see Chapter 11 and Leggett et al
(2001a, 2001b).
Figure 20.15 Example of rainwater harvesting system (from Interpave, 2010)
The aggregate sub-base in pervious pavements can sometimes be replaced with geocellular sub-base
replacement systems (Chapter 21). These will provide a higher storage capacity (with 90 porosity),
but consideration will need to be given to the use of geotextile layers to ensure adequacy of treatment
of the runoff (Section 20.6). The use of geocellular structures beneath paving systems exposes them to
very high loads. Module elastic deformation and the
strength of joints between modules are critical to
the performance of the overlying layers of blocks or
asphalt, and careful design will be required.
Further advice on using geocellular structures
is provided in Chapter 21.
Pervious pavements are generally used to
manage rainfall landing directly on the surface,
but their capacity is such that they are often also
used to manage runoff draining from adjacent
areas, such as roofs or adjacent impermeable
areas of car parks. If an adjacent impermeable
area is draining onto the surface of the pervious
pavement, the maximum ratio should be 21
(impermeablepervious) to minimise the risk of silt

geocellular sub-base replacement system (from
Interpave, 201)
394 Part D: Technical detail
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
completely blocking the pavement surface. Where pavements are draining adjacent impermeable areas,
clogging will initially develop close to the impermeable pavement and a clogging front will gradually
migrate across the pervious pavement.
Roof drainage can direct large volumes of water into the pavement very quickly, and inlet diffusers may
be required to regulate the flow velocities (Section 20.10.1). These require very careful design, especially
where syphonic drainage is discharging into the pavement. Where water from roofs is directed via catch
pits directly into the sub-base the ratio of impermeablepervious above does not apply. For smaller areas
of roof it is possible to discharge the downpipe directly onto the pavement, in which case the maximum
ratio of 21 should still apply.
Health and safety risk management design guidance is presented in Chapter 36.
20.3 SELECTION AND SITING OF PERVIOUS PAVEMENTS
Pervious pavements can be used on most sites, but they need to be used in appropriate locations. They
can often be combined with other solutions such as detention basins, ponds and wetlands allowing
these subsequent attenuation and treatment features to be shallower and smaller. The use of pervious
pavement should be avoided where there is a high risk of silt loads on the surface.
Pervious pavements are typically built as an alternative to impermeable surfaces and therefore require no
extra development space for their construction. They require only a small head difference from the runoff
surface to their outfall and can therefore be employed on very flat terrain.
Constructed pervious pavements tend to be used to drain highways with low traffic volumes and speeds
(less than 0 mph), car parking areas and other lightly trafficked or non-trafficked surfaces. However,
they are capable of supporting HGV traffic (Chaddock and Nunn, 2010, BS 75-12009) and, in the
UK, specific types of pervious pavements have been used successfully for surfaces with heavy axle
load traffic. In the USA, there are isolated examples of successful use of pervious pavements on state
highways, and they are currently looking at the use of pervious concrete design for heavily trafficked
pavements (Wanielista and Chopra, 2007). Such pavements should be designed on an individual basis
and in conjunction with manufacturers and experienced geotechnical and pavement engineers. They
should have a stiff layer of asphalt, asphalt concrete, concrete or hydraulically bound coarse-graded
aggregate below the bedding layer. The main concerns are the frequent vehicle braking and turning
actions that can cause the surfaces to rut, concrete blocks to spread and porous asphalt to spall.
The acceptability of infiltration from a permeable pavement should be determined by following the
guidance provided in Section 25.2, complying with all relevant requirements for infiltration systems with
respect to ground stability, depth to water table etc and Section 26.7 for the protection of groundwater.
Unlined pavements should not be used on brownfield sites unless it has been demonstrated that the risk
posed by leaching of contaminants is managed to acceptable levels. Unlined pavements should not be
used to treat runoff from areas with high contaminant loads if the risk of groundwater pollution due to
infiltration is unacceptably high. Where infiltration is prevented, the seasonally high groundwater level
should always be below the base of the pavement formation.
Pervious pavements can be used in most ground conditions and can be sited on waste, uncontrolled
or non-engineered fill, if necessary with a liner, where the design allows for differential settlement.
Unlined pavements should not be used in locations where infiltrating water may cause slope instability or
foundation problems, for example areas of landslides, at the top of cutting or embankment slopes or close
to building foundations unless a full assessment of the risks has been carried out by a suitably qualified
geotechnical engineer or engineering geologist.
For information on allowing infiltration close to buildings, see Chapter 25.
Chapter 20: Pervious pavements

The effects of water storage on the structural capacity of the underlying soils should also be carefully
assessed and slopes and collection systems used to manage these risks. There should always be a
nominal fall on the pavement formation level.
Figure 20.17 gives guidance on soil classification, and Table 20.1 recommends appropriate pavement
systems for a range of subgrade conditions. Both are taken from Interpave (2010), but can be applied to
any surfacing system, not just concrete block permeable paving (CBPP).
Figure 20.17 Soil classification guide (after Interpave, 2010)
The location of buried services should be taken into account in any design to ensure the long-term
success of pervious pavement projects. Shallow services should, wherever possible, be located beneath
areas of conventional impermeable surfacing (which drain to adjacent pervious areas), or within service
corridors or verges, thus avoiding the pervious construction. Deeper surface and foul sewers can often
pass below the sub-base formation layer. This approach will minimise the need to excavate through the
pervious construction to access services.
Using an appropriate mix of permeable and impermeable surfacing can provide structure to the overall
design layout both visually and technically, helping designers realise aspirations promoted by DCLG
(2007). For example, an impermeable central carriageway might be employed to contain services,
visually differentiated from pervious parking bays. Alternatively, impermeable service crossings could
also be used as pedestrian ways, clearly differentiated from pervious areas intended for vehicles.

20.1
nits used for infitration
The SI unit of reporting soil permeability is m/s. Therefore, soil infiltration rates are usually also
reported in m/s. There is a general understanding within the industry of what constitutes a high or
low value quoted in these units.
The infiltration rate of rainwater into the top surface of a pervious pavement is often compared to
rainfall intensity. Rainfall intensity is reported in mm/h, and therefore the infiltration of water into the
pervious pavement is reported in these units.
There is an extensive body of evidence demonstrating that pervious pavements perform adequately in
cold climates. They tend to withstand freeethaw conditions well and tend to be less affected by frost
heave than standard pavement surfacing (Lake County Forest Preserves, 200 Kevern et al 2009) due
to the air in the aggregate base acting as an insulating layer limiting frost penetration into the pavement,
coupled with the higher internal latent heat associated with the higher soil moisture content. Pervious
pavements do not tend to ice on the surface because water and melting snow drain straight into the
pavement rather than ponding before runoff. Pervious pavements also tend to thaw faster than normal
pavements and thus require lower than average salt applications. Studies have also shown little loss in
the treatment performance of pervious pavements during cold weather. However, they can develop a hoar
frost on the surface more frequently than normal pavement construction.
20.4 OVERALL DESIGN REQUIREMENTS
Pervious pavements provide two functions.
1 They need to be able to effectively capture the design storm event and discharge it in a controlled
manner to the subgrade or drainage system.
2 They need to provide sufficient structural resistance to withstand the loadings imposed by vehicles
travelling on the surface.
Therefore there are two sets of calculations required, and the greater thickness of permeable sub-base
from the two calculations is used as the design thickness. Pervious pavements generally require flow
controls at the outlets to ensure effective use of the storage in the sub-base. A recommended design
flowchart is provided in Figure 20.19.

20.5 HYDRAULIC DESIGN
20.5.1 General
There are four aspects to the hydraulic design of pervious pavements
a) confirmation of the adequacy of the rate of infiltration of rainwater through the pavement surface
b) calculation of the storage volume required for design storm event management
c) calculation of the outfall capacity required to convey and control the discharge of water from the
pavement structure
d) exceedance design
Exceedance design is discussed in Section 20.5.5, while (a), (b) and (c) are discussed here.
a nfitration of rainater throuh the erious surfae
The surface infiltration rate should be significantly greater than the design rainfall intensity to avoid
surface water ponding, and the calculation of the inflow rate should include all anticipated runoff from
adjacent areas. Typically, infiltration capacities of pervious surfaces are significantly greater than design
rainfall intensities and are not generally limiting factors for the use of a pervious pavement. Surface
ponding of exceedance events should be planned for in the design, taking account of the likely water
depth on the surface and the time for which it is likely to remain. Note that the surface infiltration capacity
has no relationship to the infiltration capacity of the soils below the pavement construction.
A minimum value of 2500 mm/h (for new pavements) is considered reasonable for a pavement surface
to be considered pervious in respect of surface water management (when tested in accordance with
standard test methods). The infiltration capacity of the surface materials is normally stated by the
supplier or manufacturer. There is no standard UK or European test procedure for measuring the surface
infiltration rate of pervious surfaces. However, ASTM C171M-1 has been developed for concrete block
permeable paving and ASTM C1701M-09 for pervious concrete (it could also be applied to other porous
materials such as porous asphalt and gravel- or grass-filled reinforcement systems). It is recommended
that manufacturers should provide surface infiltration rates measured using test methods and that they
are adopted as a standard method in the UK with the following amendments
1 The results should be stated in both mm/h and m/s.
2 Sealing the infiltration ring to the surface to be tested should be achieved using mastic sealant, rapid
set mortar or other suitable sealant material.
There is no doubt that the rate of infiltration through porous and permeable surfaces reduces over time.
The main ways that the surfaces become blocked are
washing of topsoil and construction materials onto the surface these risks should be reduced
through construction best practice and appropriate detailed design
accumulation of silt and debris in the joints or pore spaces at or close to the surface
the application of gritting sand to car park surfaces (not common practice in the UK) and the use of
sand as a jointing material in concrete block permeable paving (not UK practice)
binder slumping from the aggregate matrix in porous asphalt over time, which then drains into the
voids the risk of this occurring should be reduced by the use of modern binder technology to
promote adhesion of the binder.
However, it is very rare that the clogging causes complete sealing of the whole surface, and normally
it will continue to provide sufficient drainage capacity. It is recommended that a factor of safety of 10 is
applied to the surface infiltration rate of all surface types, to allow for clogging to affect a proportion of the
surface area over the pavement design life (ie the long-term surface infiltration rate will be a minimum of
250 mm/h). Information on rehabilitating pavements that suffer from clogging is provided in Section 20.14.
400 Part D: Technical detail
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Despite the reduction in surface infiltration rate over time, the available evidence (Table 20.2) indicates
that the long-term reduced rate is more than sufficient in most cases to deal with any rainfall intensities
likely to occur in the UK. Even if the pavements become completely clogged, the evidence shows that
they can be rehabilitated using sweepers combined with re-gritting of the joints.
Figure 20.20 shows an example of concrete block permeable paving after a 50 mm depth rainfall event.
This pavement was about six years old at the time and had not been maintained in that time.

b) Pavement subsurface storage capacity
The required capacity of the sub-base depends on rainfall characteristics, design return period,
infiltration potential into the subgrade, discharge constraints, and the impermeable area draining to
the pervious pavement.
The thickness of the sub-base required can be obtained by simple calculation (see Interpave, 2010) or by
detailed hydrological and hydraulic modelling. It should be noted that the Interpave procedure assumes
no time of concentration, which is likely to output a conservative design depth requirement. Proprietary
drainage software now exists that can predict hydraulic profiles across a pavement and computes
capacities for design events in more detail. However, many of the algorithms in the models are still very
simple and only approximate to actual performance.
Chapter 20: Pervious pavements
401
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Analysis (Kellagher, 201) shows that
typically, at least twice the area of the
pavement surface can be served by
the sub-base when very tight throttle
controls are applied, and nearly three
times the area when the throttle rate is
greater than 5 l/s/ha. However, where
adjacent areas drain into the surface,
the ratio of impermeable to pervious
should be limited to 21 to prevent
clogging. If roof water discharges into
the sub-base via catch pits, the ratio can
be increased.
Where partial or total infiltration systems
are used, the infiltration will mean that
Figure 20.20 event (courtesy EPG Limited)
Concrete block permeable paving after a 50 mm rainfall
the system can therefore serve even
greater areas. However, care should be taken not to hydraulically overload the pavement, as this can
cause soil stability risks due to saturation.
Calculations for a range of rainfall durations should be carried out to verify the performance of the
available storage volume.
The available storage in the base/sub-base layer is determined by the volume of the sub-base, the
slope of the pavement and the usable voids (ie voids that are freely draining) within the aggregate. A
commonly used value of porosity is 0 for the aggregates that meet the requirements for coarse-graded
aggregates in BS 75-12009 or Type sub-base in accordance with DfT (199). Care should be taken
if using values higher than this, that all the voids in a material are free draining (eg clay soils may have a
porosity but the voids are very small and not suitable for storing water). If a porosity greater than 0 is
used in the design, the material should be tested on site to confirm compliance.
On sloping sites, the volume of available storage within the sub-base will be reduced when compared
to a flat surface. ICPI (2011) suggests that where slopes are or greater, designers should consider
terracing or internal check dams in the sub-base to provide a series of compartments (BS 75-12009)
Where the water infiltrates to the soil below, this solution is easy to design, as the different compartments
do not need to be interconnected with pipes.
For Type C systems, water still has to be allowed to flow out of the sub-base that is confined by the check
dam into the lower compartment via a pipe or other structure. Flow can be from one compartment to
another if it is possible to provide a sufficiently low flow control (very small orifices may be required). The
minimum sie of orifice should be 20 mm. Solutions to this issue include combining areas so that a larger
flow control can be used, or discharging several dammed areas to a single larger flow control outside
the permeable pavement area (if levels permit). The design of the flow control and interconnecting pipe
should minimise the risk of blockage. Wherever possible, the design should allow access to either side of
the flow control in case it needs to be unblocked (although the risk of this occurring is very low).
Other solutions to storage on sloping sites include terracing the site into a series of flat areas, making
the formation as a series of horiontal terraces with the pavement surface sloping above them, making
the sub-base thicker so that the water at the low end of the pavement remains within the sub-base or
providing extra storage in a trench at the toe of a slope.
Research into the potential impact of surface slope on infiltration rates into the pavement surface has
demonstrated that below slopes of approximately 20, this should not be a significant issue. The impact
of slope on storage and potential design solutions are shown in Figure 20.21.

For the sub-base storage to operate effectively, the system requires flow controls (unless the only
discharge mechanism is via infiltration). These are generally small orifice plates in a control chamber and
can be very small (minimum 20 mm) because the risk of blockage is low, because the water has been
filtered. Where the sub-base is divided into discrete areas (separated by impermeable construction),
careful consideration is required of flow control locations and characteristics to ensure that the use of
the storage is optimised and that there is no risk of inappropriate constriction and potential flooding. The
outflow can also be to a rainwater harvesting system via a sump and pump chamber.

The spacing of the outlet pipes or collector pipes for sealed systems can be determined in an
approximate manner using guidance provided by Cedergren (197). The maximum surface runoff rate
that can be removed by a flat permeable sub-base can be estimated using Equation 20.1.

Water should flow horiontally through the sub-base to reach the outlet collection systems and there
should be sufficient capacity in any aggregate to convey the rates of flow required. Horiontal water flows
can very crudely be estimated using Darcy’s law (ICPI, 2011) Equation 20.2.

this purpose, it is assumed to be the slope of the subgrade towards the outlet. This is not the true
hydraulic head, but is a simple approximation which is generally conservative.)
Outflow from the sub-base should be via a system of perforated pipes or fin drains that provide a large
surface area for water to flow into. Outlets that comprise simply the open end of a pipe (wrapped in
geotextile) are prone to clogging and are not suitable. Perforated pipes should extend at least 1 m into
the sub-base, and the pipes should be slotted or have circular holes formed as part of the manufacturing
process. Perforations should not be made in pipes by site operatives. The perforated section of
pipe should have sufficient flow capacity through the walls to manage the anticipated flows, and the
perforations should be compatible with the aggregate sie, such that migration of aggregate particles
into the pipe is prevented. The capacity of the pipe to convey water should also be sufficient to manage
anticipated flows. The open ends of any pipes that end in contact with gravel should be capped.

20.5.2 Interception design
Studies have shown that the frequency of runoff from all types of pervious pavements is significantly
reduced when compared to gulley and pipe systems draining impermeable surfaces. Kellagher (201)
found that very high levels of compliance with Interception criteria are achievable through the use of
pervious pavements, providing there is a nominal level of infiltration available. This is because, during
small events, the water soaks into the pervious surface, laying course and sub-base, and is released
back into the atmosphere through evaporation once the rainfall has stopped. In unlined systems (Type A
and B pavements), infiltration can also deliver Interception. The results of various studies demonstrating
the ability of pervious pavements to provide Interception storage are summarised in Table 20.3. These
show that runoff typically does not occur from pervious pavements for rainfall events up to 5 mm.

Permeable pavements can be combined with rainwater harvesting systems, which is another approach to
providing Interception (Chapter 11).

Permeable pavements help reduce flow rates from a site by providing attenuation storage. The available
storage volume is provided by the void space in the sub-base
Available attenuation storage in sub-base =
Volume of sub-base × porosity in the soil/aggregate/
geocellular layer designed to be the storage volume
On sloping sites, the volume of storage will be reduced compared to the same area on a level site. The
volume of storage in a sloping site is given by
Available attenuation storage in sub-base =

CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
A flow control structure is required to constrain the rate of water discharged from the sub-base via an outlet
pipe. Where designs are accommodating small areas of pavement (eg for driveways and access routes),
it may be appropriate to link adjacent pavements together so that the control system can be larger. The
required storage volume for peak flow control should be assessed in accordance with Section 24.9.
20.5.4 Volume control design
Contribution of permeable pavement systems to volume control should be evaluated using standard
methods, based on expected infiltration rates and/or available attenuation storage and specified flow
controls. Assessment of volumetric control should follow the method described in Chapter 3.
To achieve suitable volumetric control, overflows to different areas of the drainage system may be
required or alternatively the flow control at the outlet can be designed to provide a variable discharge. The
use of rainwater harvesting (using the permeable pavement as the storage) can also be used to help to
achieve a volumetric reduction in runoff.
eedane o desin
Pervious pavement systems should include exceedance event management as an integrated part of the
system design. One option is to use gullies set slightly above the elevation of the pavement. This allows
for some ponding above the pavement surface to be used for extra storage.
Temporary storage of runoff from extreme events above the pavement surface should not be permitted
where there is a risk of surface clogging from deposited sediments and other debris.
Further guidance on exceedance design is provided in Section 24.12.
20.6 TREATMENT DESIGN
Permeable pavement drainage has been shown to have decreased concentrations of a range of surface
water pollutants when compared to impermeable surface drainage, including heavy metals, oil and
grease, sediment and some nutrients (Pratt et al, 1995 and 1999, James and Shahin, 199, Brattebo
and Booth, 200, Bean et al, 2007, Drake et al, 2012). All but nutrient removal has been repeatedly
demonstrated in many research locations. Evidence of the removal efficiencies of permeable pavements
are included in Chapter 26, Annex 3.
Because most permeable pavements substantially reduce the volume of runoff and outflow, it is logical
that they will also significantly reduce pollutant loadings to receiving surface waters. The acceptability of
allowing infiltration from the pavement will depend on the extent of the likely runoff contamination and site
characteristics (see Chapter 4, Table 4.3).
Several studies confirm that permeable pavements demonstrate significantly lower total pollution loadings
than standard pavements (Day et al, 191, Rushton, 2001, Bean et al, 2007, Drake et al, 2012).
Treatment processes occurring within pervious pavements include
filtration of silt and the attached pollutants the majority of silt is trapped within the top 0 mm of the
jointing material between the blocks
biodegradation of organic pollutants, such as petrol and diesel within the pavement construction
adsorption of pollutants (pollutants attach or bind to surfaces within the construction) which depends
on factors such as texture, aggregate structure and moisture content
settlement and retention of solids.
Enhanced soils can also be used to improve treatment within the pervious pavement system. This can be
achieved using either proprietary systems or by the addition of small amounts of substrate, or materials
406 Part D: Technical detail
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
with a higher adsorption capacity than conventional aggregates (sawdust, peat, clay soils, granular
activated carbon can all increase adsorption). The added materials should not reduce the structural
or hydraulic performance of the aggregates. The required microbes are usually already present in the
ground and further applications of microbes is not required.
The pollutants are trapped within the construction at various locations according to the type of pervious
construction. It has also been found that oils held in some types of pervious construction may be
degraded by microorganisms (Pratt, 1999). Hence oil saturation of the pavement is unlikely where supply
is evenly spread over time. A major oil spill could overwhelm the system, but this risk can be mitigated by
using specialist oil adsorbing geotextiles within the construction (a heavier weight geotextile will be more
effective, especially if it has been specifically developed to attract oil). It is thought likely that nutrients
occurring in the environment near pervious pavements, such as in grass cuttings, leaves and animal
droppings, may well provide the required stimulus for indigenous microbial community development. For
sites with a low risk of oil spillage, there is no need to use geotextile between the bedding layer and sub-
base for pollution removal performance, because the geotextile makes little if any difference to removal of
other pollutants.
If geocellular storage is used instead of aggregate sub-base, the benefits of treatment within the sub-
base gravels will be lost. However, the use of a horiontal geotextile above the geocellular units can help
mitigate this loss (Puehmeier and Newman, 200), and has been demonstrated to provide comparable
performance. Also, a significant proportion of the pollution removal has been demonstrated to occur in
the top of the jointing voids in concrete block permeable paving, the top layer of porous asphalt (if the
surface layer has a smaller grading) and in the grass/rootzone layer of grass systems.
If increased confidence in the removal of nitrogen has to be achieved then water would have to be fed
from the sub-base material below the pervious pavements to the next stage of the Management Train,
specifically designed to optimise nutrient removal. This could be achieved by linking up the pavements to a
pond or series of ponds or bioretention system with an anaerobic one as these have better removal rates
for phosphorous and nitrogen. Concrete grass grid pavers filled with sand have been found to be more
effective at removing total nitrogen than other types of pervious surface (Urban Waterways, 200).
Drake et al (2012) found clear differences in water quality issuing from CBPP and porous concrete.
The two surfaces appear to capture different pollutants. This may be the result of the higher pH
conditions within the porous concrete affecting metal adsorption. There was also initial leaching of some
contaminants from the concrete (phosphate and high pH). Porous concrete also takes time to stabilise
and, in the longer term (1 year ), performance seems to approach that of CBPP.
The treatment design should ensure that the surface layer has sufficiently small voids to trap silt within
0 mm of the surface but still be permeable enough to allow water to flow into the sub-base. Porous
asphalt, porous concrete, reinforced grass, resin bound gravel and concrete block permeable paving
with 2/6. jointing material should all meet this requirement.
20.7 AMENITY DESIGN
Pervious pavements can provide amenity in the form of both the usefulness (ie they afford flexible and
multiple use of space for a wide range of activities) and the visual aspects of the surface materials
(especially grass systems). However, there are no specific design requirements to achieve amenity over
and above the choice of surface as part of the overall planning, architectural or landscape design.
20.8 BIODIVERSITY DESIGN
Pervious pavements do not provide any direct biodiversity benefits, although they are very useful for
treating and controlling water to maximise the biodiversity in any downstream ponds or wetlands. There
are no specific design requirements or approaches for biodiversity.

20.9 STRUCTURAL DESIGN (PAVEMENT ENGINEERING)
20.9.1 Introduction to structural pavement design
The pavement design philosophy introduced by Powell et al (19) is still the basis for flexible pavement
design in the UK. The soil below a road pavement is usually much weaker than the road pavement
materials and cannot support direct wheel loads. The main principle of road pavement design is that the
constructed layers distribute the concentrated loads from wheels to a level that the soil below the road
(referred to as the subgrade) can support without failure or excessive deformation. At the surface of the
road, the pressure from wheels is the highest, and so strong, high quality materials are used in the upper
layers (eg concrete, asphalt, block paving). The pressure reduces with depth allowing weaker materials to
be used lower in the pavement (as sub-base and capping layers). In the longer term, the capping and/or
sub-base prevent groundwater reaching the bound upper layers.
The main layers that are placed to form a road pavement are shown in Figure 20.23.
Figure 20.2 Layers in a road pavement construction
The capping and sub-base layer are known as the foundation and should give sufficient load-spreading
to provide an adequate construction platform and base for the overlying pavement layers. The asphalt,
asphalt concrete, concrete, blocks or other pavement materials are referred to as structural or surface
layers and should not crack or suffer excessive rutting under the influence of traffic. One of the main
structural layers is the base, which will usually comprise either porous asphalt, asphalt concrete or
hydraulically bound material. The base layer is of particular importance in concrete block paving designed
to carry regular HGV traffic.
20.9.2 Pervious pavement structural design principles
Although no approved structural design methods for pervious pavements exist in the UK, there are a
number of general principles that should be followed when pervious pavements are designed. Guidance
by Pratt et al (2001) should be referenced for supporting detail on pervious pavement design methods
and materials.
Normal road pavement materials are not intended to allow water into the construction. Pervious
pavements do allow water into the construction, and this means that the pavement should be designed
and the materials specified, so that it can support traffic when saturated while allowing water to flow freely
through it. The materials used for pervious pavement construction should be graded to give the right
balance between achieving good structural performance and providing sufficient permeability and void
space for water storage. Care should be taken to ensure that loss of finer particles between unbound
layers does not occur, as this can reduce the strength of granular layers. Geotextile can be laid between
408 Part D: Technical detail
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
unbound layers to prevent this from occurring. Where a geotextile is not provided between laying course
and sub-base, the aggregates should meet standard geotechnical filter criteria (Section 30.5.3).
The other overriding consideration is that the surfacing will be sufficiently durable and can withstand the
likely turning and impact forces from traffic with damage (eg spreading of blocks under excessive traffic
shear forces).
In general, the approach taken to all surfaces is as follows, following Knapton et al (2012)
1 For lightly trafficked pavements, the loads applied by wheels are the critical factor, and the guidance
for those pavements is based upon wheel loads.
2 For more heavily trafficked highway pavements, the pavements are designed on the basis of the
cumulative number of standard 000 kg axles.
20.9.3 Determination of the CBR value for design of pervious pavements
Design CBR value
Californian bearing ratio (CBR) varies inversely with moisture content (as the latter increases the CBR
value decreases). The equilibrium CBR value is the long-term value that occurs once the pavement is
constructed and the moisture content of the subgrade soil comes into equilibrium with the suction forces
within subgrade pore air spaces. Suction forces can occur as a result of unloading due to excavation.
Changes in groundwater levels or wetting as a result of water storage in the sub-base will also affect the
equilibrium CBR value. Equilibrium CBR values should be used for permeable pavement design. This can
be determined by carrying out laboratory CBR tests in accordance with BS 177-1990 at the equilibrium
moisture content as described by Powell et al (1984). For Type A and B pavements the CBR should be
tested after saturation. The ICPI (2011) recommends a 96-hour saturation period.
Alternatively, the value should be estimated based on the type of soil (plasticity index and grading)
following the guidance by Powell et al (19) and BS 75-12009, as provided in Table 20.4.

These CBR values assume a high water table and that the subgrade may be wetted during the life of the pavement.
Chapter 20: Pervious pavements
409
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
The highest values of plasticity index measured on a site should be used (to give the lowest CBR value)
for the design, unless there are a substantial number of results available to allow the mean or other
statistical value to be used with confidence, but if the mean is used, there will be an increased risk of
pavement failure in some areas. It may be possible to remove soft spots and therefore ignore those low
CBR values which relate to the removed material.
On sites where the CBR varies from place to place, appropriate designs may be provided for different
parts of the site using the lowest CBR recorded in each part.
Once the subgrade is exposed during construction, the CBR value of the soil should be confirmed by
laboratory testing of CBR samples (BS 177-1990) or using in situ methods (BS 177-91990). This is
the short-term CBR value at the time of construction. If it is found to be less than the design CBR, the
subgrade should either be improved to achieve the design CBR, or the foundation thickness should be
redesigned. The reason for this is because construction during very wet weather can adversely affect the
soil strength and lead to lower equilibrium CBR values.
In summary the final design CBR value should be the lower of
1 the equilibrium CBR value obtained from CBR tests at equilibrium moisture content (saturated for
96 hours for Type A and B) or based on plasticity and grading results using the correlations above
2 the short term CBR value obtained from CBR tests on the subgrade, taken once it is exposed for
construction.
Subgrade with low CBR (CBR < 2.5%)
British Standard BS 75-1012015 specifies that the minimum permitted design CBR is 2.5 for
normal pavements and this also applies to pervious pavements. Subgrades with a lower design CBR
are considered unsuitable to support a pavement foundation. In these cases, a subgrade improvement
layer should be provided to permanently improve the load-bearing capacity of the subgrade. This can be
achieved by removing the weak material to sufficient depth and replacing it with suitable fill material. The
thickness removed may typically be 0.51.0 m. Although the new material may be of better quality, the
new design CBR should be assumed to be equivalent to 2.5, in order to allow for effects of any softer
underlying material and the potential reduction in the strength of the replacement material to its long-term
CBR value.
The existing subgrade materials may also be improved by the addition of lime and/or cement to give an
acceptable long-term CBR value if the areas with a low CBR are extensive. This will only be possible with
Type C pavements (no infiltration). The impact of water on the stabilised materials should be carefully
considered.
The incorporation of a geosynthetic material into the foundation design may also overcome the issue of
a weak subgrade. Specialist advice should be sought to adopt an alternative design CBR value that may
be necessary, based on testing or previous experience with the specific geosynthetic and the materials
being used on the scheme.
raffi ateories
Pervious pavements can be designed to carry any volume of traffic loads. Table 20.5 defines traffic loads
in terms of traffic categories. These traffic categories can be used for the design of any type of surfacing
including porous asphalt and other materials and are used as the basis for the structural design of all
types of surface discussed in this manual.

Site categories 0, 1, 2 and should only be selected where it can be ensured that no commercial vehicles
use the pavement, for example where bollards or height barriers have been installed.
In determining the site category, the use of the surface of the pavement by any construction traffic should
be assessed and allowed for.
Pedestrian loading and maintenance vehicles
Open areas are now being increasingly maintained by mechanical sweepers and other collection vehicles
that can have surprisingly high wheel loadings and other detrimental effects (eg suction sweepers) on paved
areas. Their use should be assessed in determining the traffic category appropriate to adopt for the design.
Amenity areas
In areas where there is no possibility of vehicular access (eg patios and private garden paths), a category
0 or 1 design may be adopted
Site traffi
Where the site is to be used for construction traffic, the layer to be used by that traffic should be of
adequate strength for the use. Normally the completed base should be adequate, but in case of doubt (eg
for a large-scale development), an estimate of the traffic should be made and a pavement design carried
out using current design guidance for bound or unbound pavements.
In areas not subject to commercial vehicle traffic, the design should consider loading during construction
and maintenance of adjacent areas, and other vehicles that might access the area, including emergency
vehicles. Their use should be allowed for in the design.
Design life
A 20-year design life should be generally applicable (structural) unless access for possible maintenance
of the base is likely to be difficult or expensive, in which case a longer design life may be advisable.
Where the pavement serves a finite area, ero growth in traffic is likely to be applicable. If calculated
growth figures are available, these should be used to ascertain the number of standard axles.
20.9.5 Structural design approaches
The philosophy for conventional (ie non-pervious) pavement design is that the sub-base and/or capping
layer is only influenced by the strength of the subgrade, with the thickness of the upper structural layers
(base and surface courses) influenced by traffic loadings. The design method used in BS 75-12009
for concrete block permeable paving is different, in that the traffic load does have an influence on the
thickness of the sub-base and/or capping layer. Knapton et al (2012) have combined the two approaches
for pervious pavements and used maximum wheel load design for lightly trafficked areas of pervious
paving and a conventional axle fatigue approach for more heavily trafficked pavements. They also
extended the scope for pervious pavements to heavy duty industrial pavements by applying the design
approach proposed by Interpave (Knapton, 2007).
In the UK, the established design methodologies for flexible pavements with either an asphalt or hydraulic
bound base can also be used to design porous asphalt pavements for heavily trafficked roads (Chaddock
and Nunn, 2010). Structural design of pavements is most important for those surfaces used in areas
subject to heavier or more frequent HGV traffic.
Analytical design is becoming more widely accepted in pavement engineering and can be applied to
pervious pavements. Analytical design is a very useful approach, which allows the use of different porous
or permeable materials, and it should be encouraged. However, it is vital that the material properties
assumed in the design are achieved during construction (eg the stiffness of concrete block permeable
12 Part D: Technical detail
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
paving should reflect normal construction practice and not rely on very high quality workmanship) and an
appropriate site testing regime will be required. Also, the materials used in construction should provide all
the other necessary attributes (eg durability and providing suitable skid resistance). Most analysis uses
a simplified multi-layer linear elastic model, although finite element analysis can also be used (Knapton
et al, 2012). An element of judgement will still be required in the design, based on experience of the
performance of different materials. This approach can be used for a wide range of traffic conditions. In
the USA, the ICPI (2011) has published a design program for concrete block permeable paving called
Permeable Design Pro. Although this is based on USA design methods, there is no reason why it cannot
be applied to UK design of concrete block permeable paving. One of the key design parameters in
analytical approaches is the stiffness of the various materials, and values are provided in Table 20.6.

Resilient modulus is a measure of stiffness under loads that are applied quickly (such as traffic loads).
Shackel et al (2000) found that there was little difference in resilient modulus between permeable and
non-permeable versions of block paving and also between different laying patterns. Paver shape was
found to have a significant impact of resilient modulus.
Note that when measuring the stiffness of permeable sub-base materials on site, they are likely to
return lower values than when unconfined on the surface. Experience, analysis (Interpave, 2007) and
also testing (Chaddock and Nunn, 2010) have shown that once confined by the overlying pavement
construction the stiffness will increase.
20.9.6 Structural design considerations for different surface types
The following sections provide specific information on structural design for various surfacing materials.
Grass reinforcement and resin bound materials
This section covers reinforcement grid systems that are plastic or concrete and infilled with grass or
gravel. It also covers resin bound materials. There is no recognised UK design standard for these types
of pervious pavements. Often designers rely on recommendations made by manufacturers. However,
the surfacing provides very little contribution to the load-bearing capacity of the pavement structure and
therefore the sub-base thicknesses used for asphalt or CBPP can be applied to these types of surface
(ICPI, 2011).
The systems are often used with normal Type 1 sub-base below (ie not for water storage), in which case
standard pavement design approaches should be used. If coarse-graded aggregate is used below the
surfaces to store water, the sub-base depths in Table 20.7 can be used. A capping layer or increased
thickness of coarse-graded aggregate may be required where the CBR values are less than 5. Where
used with coarse-graded aggregate sub-base, a geotextile will be required between the sand bedding/
growing layer and the sub-base, otherwise the sand will be washed down into the sub-base. These
surface types are not recommended for load classes above site category 4.

The capping layer design can also incorporate geogrid(s), which may reduce the required thickness of
material. However, the sub-base and capping layer thickness may need increasing to allow for use by
construction vehicles.
When used over open-graded sub-base such as Type , a geotextile separation layer will be required to
prevent the sand infill/bedding layer from being washed into the underlying sub-base. Trials by Chaddock
and Jones (2007) have shown that great care is needed in lapping the geotextile to ensure that washout
does not occur. It is recommended that an overlap of at least 500 mm is provided, and that care is taken
at the edges to ensure that localised washout cannot occur (lap the geotextile upwards at the edges and
suitable folds at corners to contain the bedding sand).
Porous asphalt
Porous asphalt can be designed using analytical pavement design procedures using appropriate values
of resilient modulus for the materials specified in the pavement. Alternatively, the advice in Chaddock and
Nunn (2010) may be used to design the porous asphalt layers. Another approach is to combine the sub-
base and other layer thicknesses specified by Knapton et al (2012) but replace the concrete blocks and
bedding layers with a porous asphalt layer. This latter approach is the basis for Table 20.8. Further advice
on the use of porous asphalt in car parks and private drives is provided by MPA (2009). Detailed guidance
on suitable mixtures should always be obtained from the supplier.
The sections in Table 20.8 apply in the case of subgrades of 5 CBR or greater. For pavements over
lower CBR values that are trafficked by vehicles, the following should be provided
1 CBR subgrade improvement required (Section 20.9.3)

ASTM C1701M-09 or other suitable test).
2 The sub-base CGA depths are minimum values that correspond with the equivalent thicknesses provided in Table 20.10 for modular
surfacing. The sub-base CGA and any capping layer can also be designed to Foundation Class 2 in accordance with HA (2009).
Special vehicles (SV) fall outside the Road Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations 196. SV vehicles comply with the Road
Vehicles (Authorisation of Special Types) (General) Order 200 or the Individual Vehicle Special Orders. They have higher axle
loads and weights and are commonly known as abnormal loads.
The Chaddock and Nunn (2010) report was based on a pilot study. The tables in the report showing pavement designs for up to
0 msa (million standard axels) are an extrapolation of test data and have not been validated in full sie schemes. If designs are
required for traffic category 7 and above, specialist advice should be obtained from suppliers about whether porous asphalt is
suitable and to provide an appropriate specification.
The capping layer design can also incorporate geogrid(s), which may reduce the required thickness of
material. However, the sub-base and capping layer thickness may need increasing to allow for use by
construction vehicles.
Note that porous asphalt may not be suitable as a surfacing in some locations (eg petrol forecourts, ports
or bus stops) due to either the risk of degradation resulting from fuel spills or the nature of the risk of
surface deformation resulting from the possible range of traffic forces.
Porous concrete
Porous concrete is not widely used at present in the UK. However, it is used in the USA, where comprehensive
design and construction guidance is available (eg ACPA, 2011, CRMCA, 2009, ACI, 2010). A structural
design programme for pervious concrete pavement design is available from the ACPA (called PerviousPave)
Chapter 20: Pervious pavements
415
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
and this can be adapted to design porous concrete paving for UK conditions. The equations used in the
programme and the background information is provided by the ACPA (2011). Obla (2007) indicates that
numerous applications have used a 125150 mm thick pervious concrete layer over 150 mm sub-base. Field
performance of these projects has shown that they are adequate to handle the traffic loads expected in car
parks with mainly passenger cars with very occasional HGVs (trash trucks). Where heavier loads and higher
traffic are expected, then US experience suggests using a thicker layer of porous concrete (20000 mm).
Porous concrete is a near-ero-slump, open-graded material consisting of portland cement, coarse
aggregate, admixtures and water. It has little or no fine aggregate (ACI, 2010). The combination of these
ingredients will produce a hardened material with connected pores, 2 mm in sie, which should allow
water to pass through easily. The porosity can be 155, with typical compressive strengths of (2.2
MPa). Porous concrete is laid as a plain concrete slab without reinforcement.
Recommended concrete and sub-base CGA thicknesses are provided in Table 20.9.

The sections in Table 20.9 apply in the case of subgrades of 5 CBR or greater. For pavements over
lower CBR values that are trafficked by vehicles, the following should be provided
1 CBR subgrade improvement required (Section 20.9.3)
2 CBR subgrade improvement layer required (may be incorporated into capping layer to provide a
total layer thickness of 350 mm)
2.5 CBR 00 mm capping

The capping layer design can also incorporate geogrid(s), which may reduce the required thickness of
material. However, the sub-base and capping layer thickness may need increasing to allow for use by
construction vehicles.
The designs in Table 20.10 have been assessed using ACPA (2011) assuming a 0-year design life, 0 growth,
resilient modulus of sub-base CGA is 110 MPa and 2-day flexural strength of porous concrete is 2. MPa. For
CBR less than 5 use the factors above to increase capping layer thickness or design using ACPA (2011).

Because there is currently no track record of using porous concrete in the UK, it is recommended that
expert advice is obtained to undertake site specific designs for site categories 610.
Modular surfacing (including concrete block permeable paving)
This can be used for a wide range of traffic conditions from light to very heavy duty pavements. BS 75-12009
provides standard thicknesses for the pavement layers, although these can be adjusted if materials with
a different stiffness are used following the approach described by Knapton et al (2012) or using the ICPI
(2011) design approach.
The structural design of CBPP suggested in Table 20.10 has been developed from the approach of
Knapton et al (2012). Their approach is based on a combination of finite element analysis of static wheel
loads and analysis of full-scale test results. The main difference between Table 20.12 and the Knapton
et al (2012) approach is that the table provides the same construction thickness for all of Types A, B and
C pavements. This is because any effect of infiltrating water should have been taken account of when
choosing the design CBR value. In general, Types A and B pavements will result in lower design CBR
values because of the presence of water in contact with the subgrade. The waterproofing layer and sand
protection layer (or geotextile protection) provided in Type C systems do not have any influence on the
structural design and therefore are not included in the table for structural design.
The design layer thickness has been checked using the guidance provided by the ICPI (2011). This
approach makes assumptions about the default properties of the materials used in each layer, which are
summarised in Table 20.11.

AC refers to asphalt concrete (AC 2 dense 0/60 designed in accordance with BS EN 110-12006.
For load class 5 and above, concrete block permeable paving should only be laid in a herringbone pattern.
Note for infiltration Type A systems the capping layer material should be sufficiently permeable to allow
water to percolate through it, without it losing strength. It should also have an infiltration rate that is
greater than the material below it. It should also be sufficiently durable and wear-resistant. Alternatively,
an increased thickness of coarse-graded aggregate can be used. The grading for 6F2 capping (DfT,
199) can be modified to reduce the amount of fines and make it more permeable (ie less than 5
passing the 6 microns sieve and 025 by mass passing the 600 microns sieve). This has been used
successfully below infiltrating pavements.

Porous sports surfaces
Porous sports surfaces are usually not heavily trafficked by vehicles. An important issue for surfacing
and sub-base layers used under sports pitches and games areas is that they meet the requirements
of the relevant sporting federations for ball bounce etc. Most suppliers of artificial or turf surfacing will
have this data or will test completed installations to demonstrate compliance. They also need to meet
strict tolerances on surface levels. Usually the sub-base construction required to achieve these other
requirements will be sufficient to support the likely vehicle loads (eg from maintenance vehicles).
20.10 PHYSICAL SPECIFICATIONS
20.10.1 Pre-treatment and inlets
Rainfall normally finds its way through the pervious surface via direct infiltration. However, where the
pavement has sufficient hydraulic capacity, additional runoff from adjacent impermeable areas can be
directed onto the pervious surface. The flow of water from the surface of adjacent paved areas should be
distributed along the edge of the permeable area it should not be channelled to a discrete point as this
will cause clogging of the surface.
Runoff from adjacent roof areas can be drained directly into the sub-base, where it is likely to have very
low levels of silt. However, such flows should be discharged via a silt/debris trap to prevent any risks of
clogging of the pavement construction below the surface. The flow should be distributed into the sub-
base using a diffuser such as the one in Figure 20.24.
Figure 20.2 Flow diffuser to distribute roof runoff into permeable sub-base (from Interpave, 201)
Where syphonic drainage is discharged into the sub-base, the siphon break should be before entry into
the permeable sub-base via a ventilated manhole. The siphon break should be designed to provide
sufficient capacity and to reduce flow velocities within the sub-base to prevent surcharging of the system.
The siphon break and subsequent diffusers to distribute the flow into the sub-base should be designed in
conjunction with the syphonic drainage designer.
20.10.2 Outlets
If the pavement is a Type A system that is designed to allow all water to infiltrate into the ground, there is no
need for any specific outlet. If the system is a Type B or Type C, where water leaves the sub-base to flow to
the next part of the drainage system, an outlet is required from the sub-base. This is usually achieved using
either a series of perforated pipes (which can be within the sub-base or in trenches below (Figure 20.25),
depending on the thickness of the sub-base and traffic loads and the strength of the pipes), or with a length
of fin drain along one edge of the sub-base connected to the outlet pipe (Figure 20.26).

A well-protected observation well consisting of a 150 mm perforated pipe, or equivalent, should be placed
at the downstream end of the facility. The well can be used to measure the actual emptying times of the
pavement system and to keep a record performance changes with time.

20.11 MATERIALS
The sub-base beneath pervious surfacing systems has a large proportion of interconnected voids
through which water can move freely and can also be stored. This material is different from a standard
pavement sub-base and has to be specified so that it has sufficient permeability, porosity, strength and
resistance to abrasion.
This section provides specifications for some of the key elements of pervious surfaces such as bedding
and jointing material and sub-base. It does not provide a comprehensive specification for all elements
that are required to meet recognised standards (eg the concrete blocks in concrete block permeable
paving should meet all the same performance standards as normal concrete blocks).
20.11.1 Bedding layer and jointing material for concrete block permeable paving
Bedding and jointing material needs to be free-draining and have sufficient durability to resist wear from
small movements between blocks. A typical grading specification is given in Table 20.12, but advice
should always be sought from the pervious pavement manufacturer with regard to the exact material type
that is suitable for each system. The jointing material in some systems may have smaller, mm particles
if the joints between blocks are smaller.

The material should also meet the durability requirements in BS 75-12009 (Section 20.11.4).
Sand infi and beddin aer for rass reinforement
Sand infill to reinforced grass systems needs to be free-draining but with sufficient organic content
to support plants. A root zone material (Chapter 30) is suitable, and there are also many other mixes
recommended by suppliers of the grids. Normal topsoil is not suitable.
eotetie fiter harateristis
Geotextiles that act as filters should allow free flow of water, that is with ero breakthrough head. They
should be manufactured from polyethylene, polypropylene or other suitable monofilament that can
withstand the loads applied during construction and should have a design life equivalent to the pavement
design life. They should not be adversely affected by pollutants, alkaline or acidic groundwater.
Geotextiles placed high in the pavement construction (eg between the bedding layer and sub-base of
CBPP) are subject to higher stresses than those deeper in the construction (eg at the bottom of the sub-
base). This needs to be evaluated and considered in the design.
Further guidance on geotextiles is given in Chapter 30.
20.11.4 Sub-base aggregate characteristics
The sub-base should have a minimum porosity that is consistent with the design calculations (normally
at least 0). The sub-base should also have a minimum permeability of 6 102 m/s when tested in
accordance with HA (1990).
22 Part D: Technical detail
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
The requirement for low fines content means that the surface loading will essentially be carried by
point-to-point contact between aggregate particles in the sub-base. In order to maximise the friction
between particles and thus increase strength, the particles should be rough and angular to give good
interlock. Crushed rock (granite, basalt, gabbro) or concrete with 90 fracture faces, or blast furnace
slag is required to achieve this. Sand and gravel with rounded particles should not be used in pervious
pavement sub-base construction. Aggregates should comply with BS EN 1222002A12007 or BS EN
126202002A1200. The choice is a compromise between stiffness, permeability and storage capacity.
Typical gradings for sub-base aggregates are provided in Table 20.13. The material types are from BS
75-12009 and from DfT (199) Clause 05 Type base material. However, there is no reason why
other gradings cannot be used if they are more readily available and meet all the necessary requirements,
and provided the base material is sufficiently durable.

As the sub-base will be in contact with water for a large part of the time, the strength and durability of
aggregate particles when saturated and subject to wetting and drying should be assessed. The materials
should also not crush or degrade, either during construction or in service. The specification of LA test
values, micro deval tests and flakiness tests will address these issues. Sub-base aggregate specification
requirements are summarised in Table 20.14. This table is from BS 75-12009 for CBPP but should
be applied to sub-base materials used below all types of surfacing and also for Type material and for
recycled materials. Note that these durability requirements are as, if not more, important than the grading
and should not be ignored.
Recycled material can be used where a source is conveniently available but care should be taken that
this is of consistent quality, has an appropriate grading and is free of unacceptable materials such as
organic matter or steel scrap. Leachate from crushed concrete sub-base material is likely to have a high
pH value, which could impede vegetation growth and thus lead to soil erosion at the drain outlet and/
or cause the growth of precipitates at the drain outlet. Therefore, outlets from recycled concrete sub-
bases below pervious surfaces should be designed to minimise blockage by having a large surface area
through which water is collected, and the outlets should be accessible to remove build-up or precipitates.

Note that both the resistance to wear and resistance to fragmentation are important. The LA test is an
indication of the resistance to fragmentation and can only be carried out on dry aggregate. The Micro-Deval
test (MD test) measures the resistance to abrasion when interlocking particles are subject to repeated
loading in the presence of water which is an important property for sub-bases below pervious pavements.
Impermeable membrane characteristics
These are typically manufactured from high density polyethylene (HDPE), polypropylene or ethylene
propylene diene monomer rubber (EPDM) and should be
durable, robust and able to withstand construction and operational loads
resistant to puncture, multi-axial stresses and strains associated with movement and environmental
stress cracking (or protected by geotextile or sand layers above and below as required the greatest
risk of puncture is often from the sub-base material laid on top of the membranes)
unaffected by potential pollutants
installed with fully watertight joints and discharge outlets. Welded joints should be tested to ensure
the integrity of the system and provide a more robust jointing method. The membrane should be
able to resist the punching stresses caused by sharp points of contact from the aggregate sub-
base. It should also have sufficient strength to resist the imposed tensile forces from traffic or other
loading. Where the risks associated with puncture are particularly high, consideration can be given
to protecting membranes with geotextile fleeces.
Further guidance on geomembranes and geotextiles is given in Chapter 30.

Porous asphalt
Example specification requirements for porous asphalt are provided by Korkealaakso (201).
The surface infiltration rate (or permeability) for porous asphalt quoted by Korkealaakso (201) are
based on measurement using the test method described in Series 900 of DfT (199). However, it is
recommended that for consistency in future, the surface permeability of porous asphalt is measured
using the same method as porous concrete from ASTM C1701M-09, although the specification limits
would require amending to reflect the different test method.
Porous concrete
A specification for porous concrete is provided by CRMCA (2009).
The key requirements are
compressive strength specified by pavement designer, typically between MPa and 27 MPa
(FHA, 2012)
cement content 26726 kg/m3
porosity 1525
watercement ratio 0.260.5.
Also to the requirements in the CRMCA specification it is recommended that the surface infiltration rate is
a minimum of 250 mm/h when measured in accordance with ASTM C1701M-09.
20.12 LANDSCAPE DESIGN AND PLANTING
Permeable pavements do not often support vegetation as part of the surfacing (except for grass
reinforced pavements), but the landscape can be designed and integrated either around the edge of
pavement systems, or in ones within the pavement surface layout.
If trees or woody shrubs are desired, they should be carefully selected. If trees and shrubs are planted
close to permeable paving it may require more regular sweeping to maintain the surface infiltration rate,
although this is not likely to be excessive.
Permeable pavements are an excellent form of construction near trees, because they allow air and water
to enter the soil, which is beneficial to tree growth. If tree roots have sufficient water and air in the soil,
they are unlikely to damage the permeable pavement construction.
Where grass is an intrinsic part of the porous surface (eg Figure 20.8), it should be established before
trafficking, and the surface should be kept free of sediment until the grass is established. The choice of
grass is important, and it should have a high tolerance to wear and drought, and a low tendency to thatch
build-up (for planting guidance, see Chapter 29). Where reinforced grass is used, it is important to make
sure that the infill soil is lower than the grids.
Wherever possible, it is suggested that areas in and around pervious pavements should have a topsoil level
that is at least 50 mm below the top of the kerb adjacent to the pervious pavement. Preferably, the areas
should slope away from the pervious pavement (Figure 20.27). Where areas drain onto a pervious pavement,
their surfaces should be stabilised so that the mobilisation of silt and other fine debris is minimised.
If this cannot be achieved (but there are many examples of permeable paving working satisfactorily
next to standard landscapes), the risk of clogging should be minimised through more frequent sweeping
regimes. The required frequency of sweeping should be established through visual monitoring of the
surface, particularly following intense rainfall.

20.13 CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS
The principles of good construction that apply to asphalt, standard concrete block paving and other
impermeable surfaces generally also apply to pervious pavements. The following guidance should also
be considered when constructing a pervious pavement structure. The list is in order of construction
from the subgrade upwards.
20.13.1 Subgrade
Proof rolling of the formation below Type A and B pervious pavements is not recommended as it can
reduce the infiltration rate of the soil. Subgrade soft spots can be identified using a hand-held MEXEcone
or similar (ie an instrument to measure in situ CBR values). If soft spots are identified, they should be
excavated and backfilled with suitable well-compacted material and, for Type A pavements, the materials
should be of similar permeability to the surrounding subgrade.
The formation should be prepared by trimming to level in accordance with DfT (199), to a tolerance of
20 to 0 mm. If subgrade improvement is employed, testing will be needed to demonstrate that the
design CBR values have been consistently achieved and, for Type A pavements, that the infiltration rate
of the soil is suitable.
26 Part D: Technical detail
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
The formation below Type A pavements should be protected from any operations that could reduce the
infiltration rate of the soil (eg heavy construction traffic, stockpiling fine materials, mixing concrete on it).
eomembrane andor eotetie
Any impermeable membrane should be correctly specified, installed and treated with care to ensure that
it is not damaged during construction (Chapter 30).
Geotextiles should be laid in accordance with manufacturers’ instructions and with overlaps between
adjacent strips of 00 mm without any folds or creases. It is recommended that specialist advice be
sought from the manufacturer or supplier of the geosynthetic filter (Section 20.11.3).
20.13.3 Capping layer and sub-base
The fines in a conventional impermeable material help to bind the different sie particles together, and
act to restrict the passage of water. In the case of pervious pavement materials (which lack fines), there is
potential for segregation of materials during the transportation and construction process. Care should be
taken to avoid segregation, but the material should be turned over by an excavator if this occurs. The risk
of segregation can be minimised by using an angular, crushed material with high surface friction.
The lack of fines and the open matrix structure can result in surface movement when construction traffic
passes over the sub-base, and it can be more difficult to form to the required grades. This movement can
be minimised by blinding the surface with a laying course or other smaller sie aggregate to fill in the voids
at the surface and stabilise it. The depth of the sub-base should be adjusted to include this blinding layer.
The sub-base should be laid in 100150 mm layers and compacted to ensure that the maximum density
is achieved for the particular material type and grading, without crushing the individual particles, or
reducing the porosity below the design value. There should be a tolerance of 20 to 15 mm on the
design surface level of the sub-base layer. Compaction with vibrating rollers can be difficult, as it results
in movement of the surface and often dead-weight rollers are more effective. Site trials are the best way
to determine the appropriate compaction method.
Once laid, the sub-base should not be trafficked.
This is to prevent it rutting and also to prevent it
clogging with mud and other construction materials.
If it has to be trafficked, it should be protected using
one of the following methods
a layer of DBM that can then be allowed for
as part of the structural design of pavement
(Section 20.9) this should be punctured with
75 mm diameter holes, on an orthogonal grid
of 750 mm (Figure 20.29)
a geotextile and sacrificial aggregate layer
removed before laying final blockwork
for Type C pavements only, a normal capping
layer for construction and then construct
the pervious surface once its use as a
construction surface is no longer required.
Base
HBCGA should not be mixed in concrete mixers
on site. It needs to be produced in batching plants
or mixed at the quarry. Careful mixing is required
because of the low cement content, and there is a
need to ensure that it is evenly spread throughout

Chapter 20: Pervious pavements

CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
the material and not segregated. Laying HBCGA should not be carried out in weather that is too hot, or
in heavy rain. The guidance provided by ACPA (2011) on laying porous concrete surfacing should be
followed as it is applicable to HBCGA.
Asphalt base materials should be laid in accordance with DfT (199).
Surfacing
Generally, concrete block pavements should be constructed in accordance with current industry guidance
such as that provided by UK-based manufacturer and contractor associations (eg Interpave and Interlay).
Advice should be sought from the specific manufacturer on any product-specific requirements, laying
and jointing materials, block patterns and block laying procedures. In accordance with good practice, the
block surface layer should be fully compacted and jointed to within 1 m of the laying face at the end of
each day. Other pavement surfaces should be constructed according to the relevant British Standards
and/or the manufacturer’s guidance.
Once concrete blocks are laid on the screeded bedding layer they should be vibrated into the bedding
layer. This causes grit to fill the lower part of the joints. Grit should be brushed into the top of the joints
and the blocks vibrated again. There may be settlement of grit in the joints over the first few months of
use and it is wise to allow for the blocks to be gritted again after a few months in service.
Porous concrete used as a surfacing may need joints forming in it. The ACPA recommends that the joints
are not formed by saw cutting, as this leads to dust-blocking of the adjacent areas of surfacing. The joints
should be formed using a “pizza cutter” roller before the concrete has set. Compaction of the porous
concrete (and HBCGA) should be undertaken using rollers and not vibrating plate compactors.
Porous asphalt should be laid in accordance with DfT (199).
Resin-bound gravel should be laid in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations.
For grass reinforcement systems, the bedding sand thickness should be kept to a minimum. A maximum
thickness of 20 mm is recommended. It is difficult to cut grass reinforcement systems of any kind to fit
complicated shapes without loss of integrity. This should be considered in the design and construction.
The grass grids should not be overfilled with soil because it leads to compaction, and the grass will not
grow. At least 25 mm depth should be left between the top of the grid and the infill soil. For optimum
vegetation coverage the paver or grid needs to have in excess of 0 of its area available for grass
growth. Concrete pavers can be heavy and may need to be machine laid. Unless product-specific skid
resistance data is available, they should only be used in low-speed situations. Sometimes concrete grass
grids will crack due to uneven support in the bedding sand or sub-base, but once it is cracked, the paver
will bed into the sand and will usually continue to provide support to traffic. Plastic grids need expansion
joints or allowance for movement in the construction as they can expand and buckle in hot weather.
Preventing soil and mud and other contaminants from entering the pavement surface, sub-base and
subgrade, both during and after construction, is imperative to ensure that the pavement remains
permeable throughout its design life. Construction equipment should be kept away from the area, and silt
fences, staged excavation works and temporary drainage swales (which divert runoff away from the area)
should all be considered to manage these risks. Landscaping activities should be carefully designed
and carried out to prevent deposition of topsoil, turf and other materials on the surface of the pavement.
Infiltration surfaces should not be compacted and should be protected at all times.
Further detail on construction activities and the programming of construction activities is provided in
Chapter 31.
A construction phase health and safety plan is required under the Construction (Design and
Management) Regulations (CDM) 2015. This should ensure that all construction risks have been
identified, eliminated, reduced and/or controlled where appropriate.
Generic health and safety considerations are presented in Chapter 36.

20.14 OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS
Regular inspection and maintenance is important for the effective operation of pervious pavements.
Maintenance responsibility for a pervious pavement and its surrounding area should be placed with
an appropriate responsible organisation. Before handing over the pavement to the client, it should
be inspected for clogging, litter, weeds and water ponding, and all failures should be rectified. After
handover, the pavement should be inspected regularly, preferably during and after heavy rainfall to check
effective operation and to identify any areas of ponding.
Pervious pavements need to be regularly cleaned of silt and other sediments to preserve their infiltration
capacity. Extensive experience suggests that sweeping once per year should be sufficient to maintain
an acceptable infiltration rate on most sites. However, in some instances, more or less sweeping may be
required and the frequency should be adjusted to suit site-specific circumstances and should be informed
by inspection reports.
A brush and suction cleaner (which can be a lorry-mounted device or a smaller precinct sweeper)
should be used for regular sweeping. Care should be taken in adjusting vacuuming equipment to
avoid removal of jointing material. Any lost material should be replaced. It is also possible to clean the
surface using lightweight rotating brush cleaners combined with power spraying using hot water, as
shown in Figure 20.30. This is done every two years at the site shown.
If the surface has clogged then a more specialist
sweeper with water jetting and oscillating and
rotating brushes may be required, especially for
porous asphalt surfaces, to restore the surface
infiltration rate to an acceptable level. The specialist
equipment should be adjusted so that it does not
strip binder from the aggregate in the asphalt.
The likely design life of grass reinforcement will
be dictated by trafficking and is likely to be about
20 years if designed correctly. For concrete block
permeable paving the design life should be no
different from standard paving, assuming that an
effective maintenance regime is in place to minimise
risks of infiltration clogging. Porous asphalt will lose
strength and begin to fatigue due to oxidation of the
Figure 20.0 Deep cleaning a supermarket car park,
Dundee (courtesy Abertay University)
binder. This is likely to occur slightly faster in porous
asphalt than normal asphalt, so the design life will be
reduced slightly. Porous concrete should have a similar design life to a normal concrete slab.
The reconstruction of failed areas of concrete block pavement should be less costly and disruptive than
the rehabilitation of continuous concrete or asphalt porous surfaces due to the reduced area that is likely
to be affected. Materials removed from the voids or the layers below the surface may contain heavy
metals and hydrocarbons and may need to be disposed of as controlled waste. Sediment testing should
be carried out before disposal to confirm its classification and appropriate disposal methods.
Guidance on waste management is provided in Chapter 33.
Table 20.15 provides guidance on the type of operational and maintenance requirements that may be
appropriate. The list of actions is not exhaustive and some actions may not always be required.
Maintenance Plans and schedules should be prepared during the design phase. Specific maintenance needs
of the pervious pavement should be monitored, and maintenance schedules adjusted to suit requirements.
Further detail on the preparation of maintenance specifications and schedules of work is given in
Chapter 32.

Many of the specific maintenance activities for pervious pavements can be undertaken as part of a general
site cleaning contract (many car parks or roads are swept to remove litter and for visual reasons to keep them
tidy) and therefore, if litter management is already required at site, this should have marginal cost implications.
Generally, pervious pavements require less frequent gritting in winter to prevent ice formation. There is
also less risk of ice formation after snow melt, as the melt water drains directly into the underlying sub-
base and does not have chance to refreeze. A slight frost may occur more frequently on the surface of
pervious pavements compared to adjacent impermeable surfaces, but this is only likely to last for a few
hours. It does not happen in all installations and, if necessary, this can be dealt with by application of salt.
It is not likely to pose a hazard to vehicle movements.
Generic health and safety guidance is presented in Chapter 36.
CDM 2015 requires designers to ensure that all maintenance risks have been identified, eliminated,
reduced and/or controlled where appropriate. This information will be required as part of the health and
safety file.

21Chapter Attenuation storage tanks
This chapter provides guidance on the design of attenuation storage tanks
– structures that create a below-ground void space for the temporary
storage of surface water before infiltration controlled release or use
21.1 GENERAL DESCRIPTION
Attenuation storage tanks are used to create a below-ground void space for the
temporary storage of surface water before infiltration, controlled release or use. The
storage structure is usually formed using one of the following methods:
geocellular storage systems
plastic corrugated arch structures (constructed over and backfilled with an open-
graded aggregate base)
oversize concrete pipes
oversize plastic pipes
corrugated steel pipes
precast or in situ concrete box culvert sections and tanks (including flat-packed
concrete panels)
glass-reinforced plastic (GRP) tanks
hybrid structures using reinforced earth walls and concrete roof panels
There are other types of tank system available, but these are not as commonly used
and are covered by general construction specifications and design requirements. These
are not discussed in detail in this chapter.
The inherent flexibility in sie and shape (and in some cases modularity) of the above
systems means that they can be tailored to suit the specific characteristics and
requirements of any site. Their main benefits are
1 their high storage volume (compared to structures filled with aggregates)
2 their potential for installation beneath roads and car parks (provided they are
designed to withstand traffic loadings) and recreational areas and other public
open space.
Important considerations are:
1 level of accessibility and maintainability with some types of system
2 lack of treatment performance when used in isolation
cost (compared to surface systems, assuming that these can be implemented in
public space, that is without requiring extra land-take).
These systems can be designed for use under areas trafficked by HGVs and other
heavy plant, such as at ports and airports, but it should be noted that their use under
public (or adopted) roads will generally be subject to technical approval by the relevant
highway authority. This should be sought at an early stage in the design process.

The maintainability of attenuation tank storage systems requires careful consideration. They lie beneath
the ground, so any failures or blockages will tend not to be noticed, which may increase risks to the site.
Geocellular systems and plastic arches tend not to be easily accessible for inspection or cleaning, so very
effective upstream treatment is required to ensure adequate sediment removal. There are some systems
that incorporate access tunnels or a more open structure. However, in practice these only provide
limited access, and it is difficult to see beyond the tunnels or to manoeuvre CCTV cameras within the
tanks. Unless surface access points are provided for every tunnel, access for jetting is also limited.
All of these systems require integration with the overall surface water treatment strategy, as they do not
have inherent treatment capability. They can be space-efficient, owing to the potential for use of the land
above the tanks, but as they are structural systems, the cost of installation will tend to be high compared
to storage systems on the surface.
Most of the methods of providing attenuation are well understood in terms of structural design/
performance (ie pipes and arches in various materials and culverts). The structural design of geocellular
systems tends to be more complex and there have been a number of collapses of these systems caused
by inadequate design (see Mallett et al, 201, and O’Brien et al, in press). Therefore, this chapter provides
more detail on the structural design of this type of tank structure than others, although many of the issues
are relevant to all methods.
Many of the products used to form attenuation tanks can also be used to provide the temporary storage
required for infiltration systems (Chapter 13 and Chapter 25).
21.1.1 Geocellular storage systems
Geocellular storage systems are modular plastic units with a high porosity (generally around 95%) that
can be used to efficiently create a below-ground structure for the temporary storage of surface water
before controlled release or use. The storage structure (tank) is formed by assembling the required
number of individual units (sometimes in several layers), and wrapping them in either a geotextile or a
geomembrane.
Geocellular systems have been used
in Europe since 1987 (Le Nouveau
et al, 2007) in place of stone-filled
soakaways, concrete tanks or oversied
pipework. They are light and easily
installed without heavy machinery, which
can lead to time and cost savings in
construction (Figure 21.1).
If the flow characteristics of the
geocellular unit are sufficiently well
characterised by hydraulic testing, they
can also be used as a conveyance
mechanism. Their inherent resistance
to flow can also be used in the design
to remove the need for flow controls
on some sites (using measured head–
discharge relationships and modelling).

The modular units have two basic components:
The inner “structural frame” provides basic stiffness and strength and is delivered by the box unit
(Figure 21.2).
The outer skin keeps out soil and backfill, and is delivered by the geomembrane or geotextile
(Figure 21.3).

Geocellular units are not all the same. There are various types of box units that have different structural
characteristics and load carrying capabilities. Geocellular systems can generally be categorised in terms
of their structure type (O’Brien et al, in press) as follows
1 injection-moulded units with internal columns/supports – completely assembled at the factory
2 injection-moulded units with internal columns/supports – assembled in site; there are an increasing
number of injection-moulded geocellular systems that are manufactured in sections (typically two
halves) that are stackable for ease of transport and then assembled on-site, with or without a mid-
plate or outer faces to form a tank
sub-base replacement systems this refers to a specific type of injection-moulded unit
4 open plate structures – box structures that are made from individual injection-moulded plates that
are clipped or fitted together to form a box
5 open column structures made from individual columns and roof/floor/side panels that are clipped
or fitted together to form a tank or unit
6 plastic profiled sheet structures box structures made from individual sheets of plastic that are glued
or welded together, but note that many of these types of product were developed for use as trickle filter
media in cooling towers or wastewater treatment works where they are known as structured sheet media
7 honeycomb structures.
There are other types of units available, and the above list is not exhaustive. Some units can be
assembled on site, while others will be supplied in a fully assembled form. New types of unit are
continually being introduced.
They can be designed and manufactured with a range of structural capacities to support loads from HGVs
under areas such as lorry parks.
The direction of water flow through the units can vary, depending on the internal structure. In terms of
hydraulic performance, the units can be classified as
1 treeimensional free o – water enters via inlet pipework and exits via outlet pipework which
is connected to the sides of the completed structure. D water flow occurs in types 1 to in the
preceding list. These systems can also be designed to fill vertically from below in the same way as
2D systems (see below). A typical layout is shown in Figure 21.4
2 toimensional limite oriontal o – water enters via perforated distribution pipework
running under, through or over the tank. At a critical flow threshold, water is forced out of the
pipework, through a gravel layer and into the storage tank. Types 5 and 6 in the preceding list
represent principally 2D flow systems. Typical sections through 2D systems for attenuation storage
application are presented in Figures 21.5 and 21.6.
Chapter 21: Attenuation storage tanks

CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Figure 21. Schematic of D system in storage and attenuation mode
Horiontal water flow may be substantially restricted or even not possible with honeycomb units. It is
therefore highly inadvisable to connect pipes directly to the side of the tank in the form of inlets or outlets.
The most common form of inlet arrangement for these systems is to use a perforated pipe in gravel
below the tank. When water backs up from the downstream flow control the water passes from the pipe,
upwards into the tank it then drains down in the opposite direction.
If a granular bedding of sufficient permeability is installed beneath the geocellular units as well as forming
the pipe trench, then the arrangement in Figure 21.7 can be used for all honeycomb systems as well as
profiled sheet systems. The pipe bedding and surround should be of sufficient depth and width to provide
support to the pipe, and the pipe should have sufficient strength and stiffness to support the vertical
loads. This is especially important for plastic pipes because the geocellular units do not provide the same
resistance to pipe deformation that the side walls of a trench in soil would do.
Some honeycomb systems allow limited horiontal flow and therefore this arrangement could also be used
for these system types as long as the horiontal flow capacity is sufficient to accept the design flows.
Profiled plastic sheets will normally allow horiontal water flow in one direction only. In some cases, the
units do have limited horiontal water flow capacity perpendicular to the main horiontal flow direction.
For this type of tank it is common to have inlets that operate via perforated pipes that are either located
in a gravel-filled trench within the tank or are incorporated into the units themselves. If inlet velocities are
low enough, pipes can be attached directly to the open end of the profiled sheet units. Pipes should not
be attached to the sidewalls, where little or no lateral flow into the tank can occur.
All types of sealed system require a vent to
dissipate air pressure as the tank fills. A common
rule of thumb is to provide one 110 mm diameter air
vent for every 7500 m2 of catchment area draining
to the tank. Complicated shapes should be avoided
when designing these tanks, as they can increase
the risk of sediment being trapped and also make
the installation of any geomembrane more difficult
increasing the risk of leaks occurring.
Some manufacturers supply specific modules that
are used as inspection and maintenance chambers
or sediment forebays within the tank construction
(Figure 21.5).

structure (courtesy Aco Limited)

21.1.2 Plastic corrugated arch structures
Plastic corrugated arch structures comprise plastic arches (made from high density polyethylene (HDPE)
or polypropylene). The arches have an open bottom and are supported at the base by integral plastic feet
that are laid on a bed of aggregate. The arches are backfilled with aggregate. They are usually laid in
rows and are terminated at each end with end caps.
The arches can be perforated to allow water to flow out into the surrounding backfill. In this case, the
backfill should be specified to provide sufficient porosity and permeability for the design.
The storage capacity in the system is a combination of the void space in the arches and that provided in
any surrounding aggregate (if the arches are perforated).
A typical layout detail is provided in Figure 21.8.
Chapter 21: Attenuation storage tanks
441
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Figure 21. Typical layout of an arched system
The arches can be manufactured and designed to provide suitable load-bearing performance for different
uses including heavy traffic (eg HGV).
If they have pipe connections directly into a row of arches, the space can be inspected and cleaned by
jetting. However, if rows do not have a direct and suitable pipe connected into them, they cannot be easily
accessed. Note that it is not really possible to get CCTV cameras and jetting equipment around right
angle bends in small diameter pipes, so any access pipework requires suitable design.
In the layout in Figure 21.8 only the central row of arches
is really available for flushing/inspection. The floor of the
system will be either formed of open gravel or it may be
covered by a geotextile, and this is not likely to be durable
if it is jetted frequently. If sediment is allowed to enter the
surrounding gravel, it cannot be removed (which could be
an issue with fine sediment fractions).
21.1.3 Oversize concrete pipes
Oversize concrete pipes have been used for many years
as attenuation tanks, and are available in a wide range
of standard sies and shapes. The term oversie refers
to the fact that they are larger than necessary for just
conveying water, in order to provide storage. Details of
all the different variations that are available are explained
by CPSA (201). They can easily be provided with direct
access chambers for routine maintenance (Figure 21.9).
The materials used are well understood and they have a
very long service life. They can be designed to support
loads from HGVs and other heavy traffic such as in port
or airport installations. They can meet the necessary
design standards for use under public roads.
Figure 21.9 Direct access chamber into concrete
pipe (courtesy British Precast)
442 Part D: Technical detail
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Elliptical concrete pipes can be designed that provide flexibility to fit concrete pipe solutions into areas
where space or cover depth are limited. Some manufacturers offer factory-fitted or cast-in blank ends,
which may be required if the tank is designed as an off-line storage system. Precast concrete pipes
should be designed and manufactured to meet the requirements of BS EN 19162002 and BS 5911-
12002A22010.
A typical layout of a concrete pipe system is shown in Figure 21.10. A fall is usually provided in the
oversie pipe, so an upstream catch pit may not be required if silts are collected and/or removed at the
sump on the downstream flow control chamber. Concrete pipes are rigid and do not necessarily need a
full granular surround, which can reduce the volume of imported materials required in the construction
compared to flexible pipes.
Figure 21.10 Typical layout of concrete pipe system
21.1.4 Oversize plastic pipes
Oversie plastic pipes are also used as attenuation tanks, and are available in a wide range of standard
sies typically up to m diameter. As with oversie concrete pipes, the term oversie refers to the
fact that they are larger than necessary for just conveying water, in order to provide storage. They
are usually available in 6 m sections. They can easily be provided with direct access chambers for
routine maintenance (Figure 21.11). They can be designed and manufactured with a range of structural
capacities, to support loads from, for example, HGVs under areas such as lorry parks and roads. The
larger diameter plastic pipes are normally structured wall pipes with a smooth internal face and are
manufactured from HDPE or polypropylene.
Plastic pipes may allow the use of smaller plant to lift and place them than the same diameter pipes made
from heavier materials. The lighter weight of plastic pipes compared to other materials needs to be taken
into account when assessing the risk of floatation if constructed below groundwater.
Chapter 21: Attenuation storage tanks
443
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Figure 21.11 Installation of oversied plastic pipe attenuation tanks (courtesy Polypipe Limited)
The 6 m lengths give a reduced number of joints, which can reduce the risk of leakage occurring.
The joints can be conventional spigot and socket, or the pipes can be welded together (hand
extrusion or electro-fusion welding). They can also be provided with bespoke chambers and
access points into the pipes.
The general layout will be similar to that for concrete pipes (shown in Figure 21.11), although the precise
details of bedding etc will be specific to plastic pipes, which normally require a full surround of granular
bedding material (Class S).
21.1.5 Corrugated steel pipes
Corrugated steel pipes are used to construct tanks in a similar way to plastic and concrete pipes. The
performance of these materials is well understood, and they have been in use for many years. They are
typically available in diameters up to .6 m and can be designed to suit loads including HGV traffic under
areas such as motorways and other heavily loaded areas, such as ports and airports. They can meet the
necessary design standards for use under public roads.
The pipes are usually galvanised with a inc coating on the internal and external surfaces, which should
provide a design life of up to 60 years in suitable conditions. The chemistry of the ground should be
assessed to determine their likely durability, but if necessary they can also be coated with a protective
secondary coating of a polymer, to increase resistance to aggressive ground conditions. They are often
prefabricated to include access shafts, and are likely to have gasket joints. A typical tank is shown in
Figure 21.12.
It might be possible that zinc can leach from galvanised pipes and cause pollution of the surface water
runoff (Ogburn, 201). The significance of this will depend on the pH of the runoff, the volume-to-surface-
area ratio of a tank and the contact time with the tank walls. If necessary a protective secondary coating
can be applied or a bitumen paved invert provided to prevent this. Additives can also be added to the inc
coating to reduce dissolution.

Figure 21.1 Precast concrete box culvert being installed
as part of a SuDS scheme (courtesy British Precast)
21.1.6 Concrete box culvert/tank
Precast concrete box culverts are available in a wide range of standard sections. They can come with
end walls, access shafts and preformed inlets and outlets. They can also have dry weather flow channels
formed in the base if needed. The joints are normally spigot and socket joints that are sealed using
jointing strips (eg rubber bitumen). The materials used are well understood, and they tend to have a very
long service life. They can be designed to support loads from HGVs and other heavy traffic such as in
port or airport installations. They can meet the necessary design standards for use under public roads.
They are readily accessible for maintenance to remove any sediment build-up.
Design and manufacturing requirements for box culverts are provided in BS EN 12006A22011.
Box culverts manufactured to BS EN 1 should be monolithic in structure.
Concrete tanks can also be constructed using precast concrete panels that are assembled on site to form
the tank (known as flat pack tanks) or using cast-in situ concrete.
21.1.7 Glass-reinforced plastic (GRP) tanks
GRP tanks are usually manufactured as a complete tank unit including all access shafts and inlets/
outlets. They are available in a range of sies, typically up to about 00,000 litres. They can also be laid
side by side and interconnected to form larger tanks. The tanks are easily accessible for maintenance.
The absence of site jointing reduces the risk of leaks, and they provide a durable solution with a long
service life. GRP tanks are frequently used as rainwater harvesting tanks (Chapter 11). The tank is
normally placed on a concrete base and surrounded by either a concrete or granular backfill to achieve
the required load-bearing capacity. They are quick and easy to install and can be placed below roads and
similar areas with HGV traffic.
21.1.8 Hybrid tanks
Hybrid tanks use a combination of reinforced earth walls/abutments combined with reinforced concrete
roof panels. Both elements are well understood construction methods that have been used successfully
for many years in other applications. A typical layout is shown in Figure 21.14. The whole construction is
surrounded by an impermeable geomembrane to form a tank.
The reinforced walls are constructed with open-graded stone to provide some of the storage capacity.
This also prevents the build-up of excess pore pressure or uneven water pressure within the fill, and this
helps maintain the stability of the system. Reinforced earth is a durable material that can be designed and
constructed to provide a long design life.
The system provides a large open chamber that can be accessed for maintenance, although if silt enters

the surrounding aggregate it will be difficult to
remove.
These systems can be easily designed to
support heavy loads such as HGVs and
other heavier loads (eg at ports and airports).
The materials used are very durable and
will give a long service life, providing routine
maintenance to keep sediment out of the gravel
is undertaken.
21.2 SELECTION AND SITING OF
ATTENUATION TANK SYSTEMS
Attenuation storage tank systems can generally
Figure 21.15 Hybrid tank of reinforced earth and concrete roof
panels (courtesy Stormwater Management)
be used for any site requiring subsurface
storage of surface water runoff, provided that the system is demonstrated to function satisfactorily both in
terms of hydraulic capacity and structural performance.
Effective upstream treatment is an important consideration to control the risk of the system performance
being compromised by sediment build-up. This is particularly important for geocellular and arch systems
where access and sediment removal opportunities tend to be constrained. To limit the likelihood of
sediment accumulation, it is recommended that the area drained to the tank should be as small as
practical for any given site thus the use of several smaller tanks is preferable to a single larger system.
It is recommended that attenuation tanks are installed above the groundwater table, because
groundwater pressure significantly increases lateral loads on the walls of the tank, and even a small
defect in the surrounding waterproof geomembrane or pipe joints can result in groundwater entering
the tank and filling the design storage volume. Where a storage tank has to be installed either close to
or below the groundwater table, the possibility of floatation should be prevented by ensuring that the
combined weight of the tank and the soil over the top is greater than the uplift buoyancy force due to
the groundwater (with an appropriate safety factor (Section 21.4.1 Step ). Alternatively, specialist
geotechnical advice should be sought on possible anchor systems.
In areas containing contaminated soils or contaminated groundwater, an appropriate risk assessment
should first be undertaken and the results used to specify appropriate materials for the tank, any
geomembrane surround (Chapter 30) and joint sealant. Any excavation or earthmoving processes
required should be assessed to ensure that mobilisation of contamination does not occur.
446 Part D: Technical detail
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
21.3 GENERAL DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS
Consultants who are responsible for the design of drainage often allow the structural design of all types
of tanks to be carried out by manufacturers. This can lead to confusion about who is legally responsible
for the design in situations where failures have occurred, as manufacturers had only provided design
suggestions and were not employed under contract to provide design services. It is therefore vital that it
is legally clear who is contractually responsible for both the structural and hydraulic design of a system. If
a manufacturer is to undertake the design then they should be employed under a contract to specifically
provide the design services. The design and communication responsibilities between the appointed
parties client, designer, contractor and unit manufacturer can be clearly defined via the CDM process
Construction (Design and Management) Regulations (CDM) 2015.
It is preferable that the organisation that is responsible for the hydraulic design of a tank is also
responsible for the structural design, to avoid any confusion in responsibility.
Health and safety risk management design guidance is provided in Chapter 36.
21.4 STRUCTURAL DESIGN
Each different type of tank system will have its own specific design guidance and British, European or
American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) Standards, based on the structural form and types of
materials they are manufactured from. The relevant standards, codes of practice and guidance should
always be followed.
The following factors require careful consideration for all systems, to ensure a robust and adequate
design. These are adapted from O’Brien et al (in press):
appropriate structural, geotechnical and hydraulic design methods and the information required by
those methods
the influence of specific site ground conditions on the structural and hydraulic performance of the tank
the influence of the tank on the surrounding ground
the importance of long-term unit deformation processes (creep) for the design of plastic tanks
the applicability and relevance of manufacturers’ laboratory strength testing results
manufacturers’ design limitations on system performance, eg depth constraints
the predicted structural performance of the tank and any scenarios that might lead to overloading,
such as the running of heavy plant across tanks not designed to carry such loads, or the use of
unsuitable backfill, for example containing boulders or soft clay
the influence of groundwater levels on system structural and hydraulic performance
the influence of infiltration of water on the surrounding ground and external tank loadings for
example, there have been cases where water seepage out of deeper unlined geocellular tanks has
caused a rise in pore pressures in backfill or soils around the tank, which has increased the earth
pressure on the side of the tank, leading to structural failure the risk of infiltration water reducing the
strength of soils below any nearby foundations also requires careful consideration
the effect of surface water flows into excavations during construction, which could cause flotation of
tanks during construction
the risk of detailing errors and late on-site changes by contractors, such as increasing the depth,
changing overlying pavement layers, spanning tanks over channels or changing the type of tank.
From a structural perspective, tanks may fail to perform adequately if either the basic structural frame is
overstressed or it moves excessively, or for some systems if the outer skin is torn or moves excessively.
It is important for the designer to understand the fundamental aspects of tank behaviour, based on an
Chapter 21: Attenuation storage tanks
447
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
appreciation of its structural form and material composition. This will then enable the designer to interpret
the test data available for the tank system, and to select an appropriate type of tank, given the specific
site conditions and loading regime.
Calculations should be carried out to check that the tank will be stable and will not move excessively
under the anticipated range of loading conditions during the design life of the tank installation. As a
minimum, three separate checks need to be made. These are to determine that
1 the structure is stable under normal working loads for the permanent works
2 the structure is stable under accidental loads – the ability of the units to withstand occasional
extreme loads should be checked, for example HGV or maintenance vehicles moving across a car
park, or large mowing vehicles for shallow installations within landscaped areas
3 the structure is stable during the site works – loads to be applied during construction need to be
known, or appropriate assumptions made, together with their location relative to the tank these
assumptions should be stated on the project drawings.
The design strength should be compared to the design loads for the scenarios described above.
The design strength should be greater than the design load. Also, on most sites there will also be a
requirement to carry out a serviceability check to make sure that horiontal and vertical deflections are
not excessive and will not adversely impact overlying surfacing materials or nearby structures. The design
loads are also used to estimate deflection or settlement using the design deflection properties of the tank.
For any type of system, claims by manufacturers regarding performance should ideally be supported by
independent verification (eg British Board of Agrment BBA certification).
Typical loads that should be considered for any tank are shown in Figure 21.16.
Figure 21.16 Typical loads to be considered in structural design of attenuation tanks
The main loads to be considered are:
weight of soil on top of the tank
characteristic traffic loads (point loads from vehicle wheels and general surcharge load)
earth/groundwater pressures (which are based on the ground model for the site)
loading from maintenance activities to any nearby buildings/landscape (eg cherry pickers)
448 Part D: Technical detail
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
accidental loads that could reasonably be
anticipated (eg an HGV movement on a
residential car parking zone)
loads from temporary works during construction
(eg cranes).
The weight of the soil should be determined using a
conservative value of bulk density.
The flowchart in Figure 21.17 (and the steps
described below) has been developed specifically for
the design of geocellular tanks. However, the general
principles are applicable to the structural design of
any buried structure that stores surface water, and so
the flowchart can be used as a guide to the design
of all the other types of storage tank described in
Section 21.1.
214.4.1 Geocellular storage systems
The structural design for the main types of
geocellular systems used in the UK should be in
accordance with O’Brien et al (in press). This is
consistent with geotechnical Eurocodes and covers
all types of geocellular units. This report should be
read in full before the appointed designer attempts
the structural design of geocellular units.
A simplified flowchart that describes the key steps
in the structural design of geocellular tanks in
accordance with O’Brien et al (in press) is provided in
Figure 21.17. The steps are described in more detail
in the following sections.
Ste Determine site assifiation
The first step in the structural design is to determine
the site classification. The classification gives an
indication of the level of risk associated with the tank
and therefore determines the level of professional
qualifications required of the designer, the extent of
Figure 21.17 Simplified summary of structural design
process for geocellular units
design information required of the units or ground
properties, the complexity of calculations and analysis and the level of checking required. The more
complex the circumstances or the more severe the consequences of failure, the greater the extent and
detail of the calculations that are necessary for the design. O’Brien et al (in press) provides more detailed
information on the scoring system. The site classification system covers the range from 0 (very low risk)
to (high risk). The design checks and professional experience of the checker can range from relying
on supplier advice for very low risk applications up to the need for an independent Category 3 check of
the design for high risk schemes (eg in the hard shoulder of a motorway where the units are within the
influence of a structure). Details are provided in Table 21.1 which is from O’Brien et al (in press).
Note that some local highway authorities may classify anything as a highway structure if it is within
.66 m of the highway or it has an internal span or diameter greater than 900 mm (including pipes with a
diameter or aggregate diameter of multiple smaller pipes greater than 900 mm to manholes or inspection
chambers). The highway authority should be consulted on whether tanks close to the highway are to be
regarded as Category 3 in Table 21.1.

Notes
1 A higher design classification may be used in order to justify a more economical design for example, a more rigorous analysis of soil structure interaction may lead to increased confidence in the
performance of a tank, and allow lower quality backfill to be used around the tank or avoid the need for additional measures to reduce the earth pressure on the side of the tanks.
2 See O’Brien et al (in press) for definitions of remote from foundations, retaining walls, slopes etc.
The design check requirements are intended as a minimum guide for consideration and are not an all-encompassing exhaustive list. Further requirements and checks may be required depending
on the particular circumstance and as directed by a competent designer.

Step 2 – Develop the conceptual ground model
Many construction cost overruns are caused by unforeseen ground or groundwater conditions, and
collapses of structures including geocellular tanks have occurred because of a lack of understanding
of the ground or groundwater. The development of a conceptual ground model is an important step in
ensuring the successful design, construction and operation of geocellular tanks.
The conceptual ground model shows the possible subsurface conditions that can be predicted from the
available desk study and ground investigation data for a site (Geological Society, 2002). Developing a ground
model that includes the known and suspected features below and adjacent to a site will help identify the likely
implications of the ground for the design of a tank and ensure that appropriate analyses are completed.
It is often useful to draw the conceptual ground model as a three-dimensional diagram that allows the
scale and location of ground features to be assessed in relation to the tank. The model should include
a characterisation of the geology in engineering terms, which will allow the geotechnical properties and
their likely lateral and vertical variation to be assessed within the context of the model.
Key information that should feed into the ground model includes
overall site topography and potentially adverse effects of nearby structures/earthworks (eg increased
earth pressure at the foot of an embankment), and/or vegetation (eg retaining walls, slopes,
temporary, permanent or future planned works or changes in moisture content and swelling or
shrinkage of soil due to trees)
site history and geology (eg ground/groundwater contamination, historic landslips or mining)
groundwater levels and flows
the soil-structure interaction between the tank and the surrounding ground.
Step 3 – Design loads and partial factors of safety
The next step in the design is to determine the applied loads from all sources (horiontal and vertical).
Characteristic loads are a best estimate of the load likely to be placed on a structure during its design
life. The characteristic loads derived for the permanent and temporary works need to be factored to allow
for possible variations and dynamic effects, in order to calculate the design loads, and guidance is again
provided in O’Brien et al (in press). Advice on loads in areas such as ports, where very heavy machinery
is present is provided by Interpave (2010). It is normal to apply dynamic factors to container loading
equipment for pavement design in these areas, and it would be prudent to do so for geocellular tanks.
The horiontal loads (or actions) will depend on the properties of the surrounding soils. When
assessing the ground properties used to calculate earth pressures, the advice of a geotechnical
engineer or engineering geologist should be sought. The presence of groundwater at the site needs
to be investigated, both at the desk study stage and during the ground investigation, and given careful
consideration when interpreting likely future site conditions over the tank’s design life. When geotechnical
problems occur, it is often due to unforeseen groundwater problems. It is particularly important to
consider the potential for seasonal and weather-related fluctuations in the groundwater regime.
Standard soil mechanics theory as described in many textbooks is used to determine the applied
horiontal loads (eg Barnes, 2010). The characteristic properties of the soil should be determined from
site investigation data, and these are reduced by the appropriate partial factors provided in O’Brien et al
(in press) and also site importance factors which are intended to ensure that the probability of failure is
sufficiently remote, depending upon the site classification and associated consequences of failure.
Step 4 – Determine design strength and deformation properties for the system
The structural properties for the system to be used will be required to allow the design to be completed.
This information should be provided by the supplier or manufacturer of the system being considered and
452 Part D: Technical detail
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
should have been derived via certified testing programmes. The test data and certificates for the units are
normally required by the designer.
The type of tests vary from quick compression tests to long-term creep rupture tests, using both full load
platens (cover the entire surface of the box) and 00 mm diameter load platens. The test data required for
installations depends on the site classification the higher the site classification the greater the extent of
test data that is needed.
The results from laboratory tests are used to arrive at a characteristic strength. The characteristic
strength is reduced by partial factors of safety to determine a design strength for the units. This process
is explained in O’Brien et al (in press). The test methods should replicate the behaviour of the structure
when it is in the ground.
Many manufacturers only supply test data for single units. Some types of units may behave differently
when stacked on top of each other, depending on the layout of the units within the tank and the nature of
the applied loading the strength can reduce, or deformations may increase. This aspect needs careful
consideration by the designer, and, as recommended by O’Brien et al (in press) may necessitate full-
scale in situ testing.
Risk of damage to overlying pavement surfaces is a function of elastic short-term differential movement,
not total movement. However, the use of allowable total movement criteria under repeated traffic loads
is helpful, for routine simple assessments, and as a trigger for indicating the need for more detailed
analysis. The allowable movement criteria need to be realistically assessed, based on the specific use of
a site, its functionality and the nature of the paving system.
Step 5 – Design calculations and analysis
Once the design loads and design strength/deformation properties have been determined then the
designer will need to undertake checks on the following modes of failure for each scenario when
designing geocellular unit installations:
1 Global stability and deformation – This is a check on the overall stability of the tank and
surrounding ground. It is essential that the overall stability and deformation of the site is checked.
These checks should be summarised in the geotechnical design report, and will include issues such
as checks on the stability of any slopes or retaining walls located on or adjacent to the site, and a
review of any potential geohaards or historical activities (eg solution features in chalk, mining or
quarrying activities), which may lead to global stability or subsidence risks. Global deformations
may develop because of swelling in the base of excavations, settlement over non-engineered fill
material or soft, compressible soils, the presence of metastable soils, volume changes in clay soils
due to the presence of trees. Global movements need to be carefully assessed by an appropriately
experienced geotechnical engineer.
2 Interaction checks It is essential that the units are designed, taking into account any interactions
(either extra loading on the tank or potential instability due to the tank) with existing structures, existing
slopes, building foundations, retaining walls, adjacent highways/railways or any similar structures or
features. It will often be desirable to relocate the location of the geocellular unit where possible to
minimise the interactions with adjacent structures rather than having to design to account for them.
3 Stability of geocellular unit – The stability of the geocellular units should be assessed under the
applied loads. This is an ultimate limit state. This should include a check that the design vertical and
horizontal strength of the geocellular units is greater than the design vertical and horizontal loads
respectively (both in the short term for temporary works and in the long term). It should also include,
where appropriate, the overall stability of the geocellular units in terms of overturning or shearing
of the units themselves. Flotation should be considered for tanks below the groundwater table or if
groundwater level could rise over the design life of the tank.
4 Deformation of geocellular unit Considering the deformation is a serviceability check. Lower
factors of safety than those used for ultimate limit state assessment are applied to loads, soil
properties and the unit properties for a serviceability check. The magnitude of the allowable
Chapter 21: Attenuation storage tanks
453
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
settlement (or horiontal movement) of geocellular units will often be critical to design, due to the
long-term creep behaviour of plastics. It is important that the geocellular unit designer is involved in
discussions with the overall project designer, before an allowable movement is decided. Both long-
term deformation due to creep and short-term elastic deformation should be checked. As discussed
in O’Brien et al (in press), if units are exposed to significant traffic loading, then specialist cyclic
testing may be required to assess their behaviour under repeated loading. The assessment of short-
and long-term movements will be particularly important if sensitive services or structures are located
in the vicinity of a tank.
Step 6 – Prepare geotechnical design report
The geotechnical design report is an important document, referred to in BS EN 1997-1200A1201,
which allows those constructing the tanks and managing them during operation to understand the
assumptions and limitations within the design (eg assumptions about construction methods or loads).
The report summarises the ground model, data, methods of calculation and results of calculations. It will
also identify the level of supervision, testing or monitoring and maintenance required during construction
or operation. The detail required in the report will depend on the complexity of the project. For simple
designs, a single page may be sufficient, whereas complex designs may require a comprehensive report
(Frank et al, 200). A checklist of items to be provided in the geotechnical design report is provided in BS
EN 1997-1200A1201.
The geotechnical design report should be updated if any changes are made to the design as construction
progresses, and it should form part of the records for the project that are included in the health and safety
file (provided to the client at the end of the project, as required by CDM 2015).
Further information on the contents of the geotechnical design report is provided in BS EN 1997-
1200A1201.
21.4.2 Plastic corrugated arch structures
Many of the general requirements for the structural design of geocellular tanks also apply to plastic arch
systems. There are two ASTM standards that provide guidance on the required structural properties and
load testing of plastic arch systems (one for those manufactured from polypropylene and the other for
those manufactured from polyethylene):
corrugated arch chambers manufactured from polypropylene – ASTM F2418-13 – the design of
these systems are not covered in detail in this manual
corrugated arch chambers manufactured from polyethylene – ASTM F2922-13e1
The site classification system described in Step 1 of the structural design for geocellular units may also
be applied to plastic arch systems, to ensure that the design is carried out and approved by someone with
appropriate qualifications and experience. The development of a conceptual ground model as described in
Step 2 for geocellular systems is also important, as is the geotechnical design report described in Step 6.
Guidance on the structural design of any type of plastic arch system is provided in ASTM F277-1. The
structural design includes the design of the composite system made up of the chamber arch, the chamber
foot and the soil envelope. Important factors that should be addressed in the design are
1 creep deformations over time and the creep rupture strength of the arches
2 global and local buckling of the arch walls, tensile stress in walls, capacity of the foundation material
to support bearing pressure from the chamber foot and the capacity of the subgrade to support the
loads from the foot
influence of adjacent arches on each other
4 the displacements that will occur under load and the effects that these may have on the surfacing
above, the hydraulic performance and the distribution of loads assumed in the model for item 2 above
454 Part D: Technical detail
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
5 test results from full-scale testing of completed installations (this does not require testing of every
installation) to support the chamber design calculations.
Where appropriate, the load requirements stated in ASTM F277-1 should be replaced by those in the
relevant Eurocodes. The design of plastic arch systems should also comply with relevant requirements of
geotechnical Eurocodes.
21.4.3 Oversize concrete pipes
The structural design of concrete pipes should follow the guidance provided in BS EN 1295-1:1997 using
the national design method in Annex A. Guidance on how to apply BS EN 1295 to concrete pipe design is
provided by CPSA (201). Guidance is also provided in BS 92952010. A summary of the national design
methods is provided in PD CEN/TR 1295-22005.
Concrete pipes should meet the requirements of BS EN 19162002 and BS 5911-12002A22010. The
standards place pipes into different strength classes based on their maximum crushing load, although
most standard pipes available in the UK meet the requirements for Class 120. The pipes should not
collapse under the maximum load specified when tested in accordance with the standards. Proof load
tests are also required, and reinforced pipes should not crack by specified amounts in this test (the proof
load test for unreinforced pipes is the maximum load).
Small diameter pipes up to 00 mm diameter can also fail due to longitudinal bending (ie as a beam), and
the standards also specify minimum values of bending resistance for pipes.
Concrete pipes are rigid and have a high inherent strength. They resist applied loading by a bending
action within the pipe walls. They are generally stiffer than the pipe surround material, in particular the
side fill, and therefore support a higher load than the side fill material. The structural design described in
BS EN 1295-11997 considers the loads applied to the pipes (including the influence of the trench walls
and backfill) and the influence of the pipe bedding and surround on the applied loads. A factor of safety
between 1.25 and 1.5 is used in the design (this is the global factor of safety).
One of the main considerations in the design of any pipe structure is the location in which the pipe is
installed. These construction conditions are categorised as
narrow trench
wide trench or on the surface, over which an embankment is then built
narrow trench over which an embankment is then built
tunnel, heading or when the pipe is to be installed by jacking.
The installation location has a significant influence on the loads that the pipe will have to support.
Therefore, any assumptions made in the design should be made clear on drawings by the designer so
that construction of the tank does not invalidate them. The narrow trench condition will give suitable
working space around the side of the pipe during installation. If the trench width is increased significantly
beyond this, there comes a point where the friction between the backfill and trench walls no longer
contributes to load reduction on the pipe and consequently loads on the pipe increase.
For pipes above 600 mm diameter, some part of the water load under working loads should be allowed for
in the structural design. Often the pipes may well be subject to the highest loads during construction and
this should be taken account of in the design.
Rigid pipes will to some extent rely on the backfill structure to transfer loads into the bedding and any
assumptions made in the design regarding these aspects should be clearly stated on any design drawings.
The general principles of the site classification system described in Step 1 of the structural design for
geocellular units may also be applied to oversie concrete pipe systems with some modification to ensure
that the design is carried out and approved by someone with appropriate qualifications and experience.
Chapter 21: Attenuation storage tanks
455
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
The development of a conceptual ground model as described in Step 2 for geocellular systems is also
important, as is the geotechnical design report described in Step 6.
21.4.4 Oversize plastic pipes
The structural design of plastic pipes should follow the guidance provided in BS EN 1295-1:1997 using
the national design method in Annexe A. Guidance on how to apply BS EN 1295-1 to plastic pipe design
is provided in BS 92952010. Various manufacturers also provide their own guidance on how to apply the
British Standard.
Plastic pipes are flexible, and deform under load to form a slightly oval shape in the ground. The
deformation is an important part of developing the load capacity of the pipe/soil system. As the pipe
moves outwards horizontally the passive earth pressure increases until the pipe–soil system comes
into equilibrium.
Further deformation will not occur thereafter unless a higher vertical load is applied to the pipe–soil
system or consolidation (or creep) of the materials occurs over a long period of time. It is internationally
recognised that when a pipe is installed in accordance with an appropriate code of practice, increases
in deflection virtually stop after a short period of time. The duration of time is dependent on soil and
installation conditions but generally does not exceed two years.
The performance of the pipe will depend on:
stiffness of the natural soil in which the trench is cut (represented by soil modulus)
density of the overburden
magnitude of dynamic loads due to trafficking
hydrostatic loading
acceptable factor of safety against buckling (typically 2 with soil support and 1.5 without soil support)
stiffness of the pipe bed and surround and the elastic modulus of the surrounding soil
specified maximum limit of deflection.
Soil modulus has a significant effect on the results and should be carefully assessed. Where the soil
surrounding the trench walls is a weak material, the level of support provided will be much lower than any
specified pipe surround. Therefore, only considering the modulus of the pipe bed and surround will over-
estimate the overall modulus of the pipe/soil system.
As with other plastic systems, creep is an important consideration, and all pipe manufacturers will provide
the results of creep tests for use in the design.
A limit on vertical deformation is necessary to ensure adequate long-term performance of plastic pipes.
Appropriate deflection (serviceability) limits should be set on a case-by-case basis. For example, greater
limits may be allowable in a deep landfill installation compared to a pipe buried at a shallow depth under
a road. Deflection limits within the UK vary, depending on the relevant adopting authority. For design
purposes DfT (2001) specifies a maximum allowable deformation of 5 for thermoplastic structured walled
pipes, while the water industry tends to specify 6 based on the requirements of BS EN 1295-11997.
Flexible pipes rely on the backfill structure to help support loads, and any assumptions made in the
design regarding these aspects should be clearly stated on any design drawings.
The general principles of the site classification system described in Step 1 of the structural design for
geocellular units may also be applied to oversie plastic pipe systems, with some modification to ensure
that the design is carried out and approved by someone with appropriate qualifications and experience.
The development of a conceptual ground model as described in Step 2 for geocellular systems is also
important, as is the geotechnical design report described in Step 6.
456 Part D: Technical detail
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
21.4.5 Corrugated steel pipes
Corrugated steel pipes are considered to be flexible and are designed following BS 1295-11997 and the
associated guidance documents. Advice is also provided in HA (1991). This is routinely used as a design
tool by some manufacturers. Specific advice is also provided by manufacturers of these systems.
In terms of structural design, the issues raised in relation to plastic pipes apply to these systems as well,
although the magnitude of creep deformation in steel structures is far less than in plastic. The design
does however need to take account of the protection provided against corrosion and make a suitable
allowance for corrosion and loss of section over the design life.
As per oversie plastic pipes, flexible corrugated steel pipes rely on the backfill structure to help support
loads, and any assumptions made in the design regarding these aspects should be clearly stated on any
design drawings.
The general principles of the site classification system described in Step 1 of the structural design for
geocellular units may also be applied to corrugated steel systems with some modification to ensure
that the design is carried out and approved by someone with appropriate qualifications and experience.
The development of a conceptual ground model as described in Step 2 for geocellular systems is also
important, as is the geotechnical design report described in Step 6.
reast onrete bo uert setions inudin ataed onrete anes
Precast box culverts should be treated as a structure and the structural design should be undertaken by
a suitably qualified structural engineer. The design should comply with the relevant Eurocodes for precast
reinforced concrete and BS EN 12006A22011. Further advice is provided by the BCA (201).
21.4.7 Glass-reinforced plastic (GRP) tanks
Circular GRP pipes are considered to be flexible pipes in accordance with BS EN 1295-11997. Structural design
should follow the design guidance in that document, as explained above for plastic and steel flexible pipes.
As per all other types of flexible pipe, these pipes rely on the backfill structure to help support loads, and any
assumptions made in the design regarding these aspects should be clearly stated on any design drawings.
21.4.8 Hybrid tanks using reinforced earth walls and concrete roof panels
Hybrid tanks have two elements:
precast concrete roof panels – designed by a structural engineer to comply with the relevant
Eurocodes for precast reinforced concrete described above for box culverts
reinforced soil abutments designed in accordance with BS 006-12010. The design should also
follow other relevant geotechnical Eurocodes – advice is also provided in HA (1996a)
The general principles of the site classification system described in Step 1 of the structural design for
geocellular units may also be applied to hybrid systems to ensure that the design is carried out and
approved by someone with appropriate qualifications and experience. The development of a conceptual
ground model as described in Step 2 for geocellular systems is also important, as is the geotechnical
design report described in Step 6.
21.5 HYDRAULIC DESIGN
21.5.1 General
The hydraulic design of on- or off-line storage systems using pipes or tanks should be in accordance with
WRc (2007, 2010 and 2012) using standard routing methods (Section 24.11). Useful information is also
provided in BS EN 752200.
Chapter 21: Attenuation storage tanks
457
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Infiltration systems should be designed to comply with Chapter 13 and other current guidelines (BRE,
1991, or Bettess (1996).
The velocity of water entering tanks from larger pipes can be significant, and the internal structure
can provide sufficient resistance to cause water to back up in the pipework. This is mainly a problem
for geocellular systems. In order to minimise this effect, most manufacturers of geocellular systems
recommend the use of manifolds to split the flow into a series of smaller pipes that are connected into the
tank (Figure 21.18).
Figure 21.1 Manifold to distribute flows from large pipe into geocellular tank
Particular care is required where syphonic roof drainage discharges into any type of tank that the inlet is
adequate to cope with the flows. It is usual to provide a brake chamber to slow down flows. It is also vital
that sufficient venting of the tank is provided where syphonic roof drainage enters tanks, to prevent uplift
pressures rupturing the overlying surface during rainfall events.
21.5.2 Interception design
Tanks that are designed as attenuation systems and are fully impermeable do not provide any
Interception, because all runoff will flow through and be discharged from the tank. Appropriately designed
attenuation tanks (ie only draining small catchment areas) that are not lined and allow some water to leak
into the surrounding soil can provide Interception if the soil has sufficient capacity for infiltration (usually
this can be achieved in soils with permeability as low as 1 10 m/s). This does, however, require careful
design, and shallow tanks taking runoff from relatively small areas are preferred.
There have been cases where water seepage out of deeper unlined tanks has caused a rise in pore
pressures in fine sands around the tank, and this has increased the earth pressure on the side of the
tank, leading to structural failure. There is also a risk of reducing the strength of soils below any nearby
foundations. Therefore, a thorough geotechnical assessment of the impact of water seeping from larger
and deeper tanks may be necessary.
458 Part D: Technical detail
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
ea o ontro desin
Attenuation tanks can help reduce flow rates from a site by providing attenuation storage. The available
storage volume is provided by the void space in the tank structure:
Available attenuation storage in the tank = Volume of tank × tank porosity
The size of the tank should be determined using the hydraulic design methods described in Section
24.9. A flow control structure is generally required to constrain the rate of water discharged from the tank.
Often underground tanks are designed to attenuate rainfall events up to 10 year event greater than this
are stored above ground.
If the headdischarge relationships from hydraulic flume tests are known for geocellular units they can
be also be used to convey water across a site and can in some circumstances provide the necessary
discharge control, removing the need for other flow controls such as orifice plates or vortex flow controls.
It is common practice to oversize the design volume of any tank that is considered to be at risk of
sedimentation and hard to maintain by 10 to allow for loss of storage due to sediment build-up. This is
a precautionary measure and is not a replacement for effective sediment management upstream of the
tank. The 10 figure is an arbitrary value and may be inappropriately large in some applications. For
example, a system taking only roof runoff would take 250 years to suffer a 10 loss of storage volume.
Table 21.2 provides more information.
21.5.4 Volume control design
Contribution of storage tank systems to volume control should be evaluated using standard methods
based on expected infiltration rates and/or available attenuation storage and specified flow controls
(Section 24.10).
eedane o desin
An exceedance flow route will be required for rainfall events that exceed the design capacity of the tank
system. This can be achieved by installing an overflow pipe above the design water storage level in the
tank or overland flow routing from surcharging components upstream of the system (Section 24.12).
21.6 TREATMENT DESIGN
Storage tank systems do not provide any form of treatment of surface water runoff, and they therefore
need to be combined in a Management Train with other methods that do provide suitable treatment of
all relevant pollutants (Chapter 26). Treatment to remove coarse sediment should always be provided
upstream of a tank.
21.7 AMENITY DESIGN
Storage tank systems can provide amenity value if they are storing water for use. They can also promote
the multi-functional use of space, by allowing the surface above the tank to be used for recreation or
other amenity facilities. Tanks can also be used in conjunction with other surface features so that water
level rises in those features can be minimised to maximise their amenity value and minimise health and
safety risks.
21.8 BIODIVERSITY DESIGN
Storage tank systems do not have any inherent biodiversity value, but they can help reduce the impact of
heavy flows on the downstream system, and this can help facilitate biodiversity delivery in those areas.
Chapter 21: Attenuation storage tanks
459
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
21.9 PHYSICAL SPECIFICATIONS
Attenuation tank structures are commonly used components of drainage systems. The specification of the
system should be based on its required performance at a particular site, as determined from the hydraulic
and structural design calculations and models discussed earlier in this chapter.
There are many standard specifications available (eg WRc, 2012, and DfT, 199) that may be used for
these types of structure. British Board of Agrment (BBA) or other certification can provide some of the
information necessary for design approval but they should be read carefully to understand the limitations
imposed by the certificate (Box 21.1).
BOX
21.1
he use of and other ertifiation shemes
BBA certificates, CE marking and other certification schemes are only intended to help designers,
procurement professionals and regulators understand the potential performance of a product
(DECC, 2012). For example, the performance of a product can be stated in terms of strength,
deflection under load and creep deformations over specified design lives.
Certification establishes the technical performance of a product (or a system, if the performance
depends on the provision of different components) for specified loading conditions. The required
performance on a particular site depends on where it is going to be used (depth, lateral pressure,
traffic loads etc). The designer of the drainage system will need to assess whether the level of
performance stated in the certificate satisfies the loading and allowable deflection conditions that
apply to the project in question (DECC, 2012). A certificate is not a guarantee that a particular
product is appropriate in any defined situation. Design calculations are still required and should be
checked rigorously. The certificate should be read carefully, especially with regard to design life and
limitations on the applications covered by the certificate.
It is often erroneously believed that BBA certification of products is required to comply with Building
Regulations or to gain building control approval. This is not the case (DECC, 2012).
21.9.1 Geocellular structures
There are currently no British or European standards for geocellular structures or units, although there is
work being done at the time of going to press to develop European product and testing standards.
Specification of geocellular or modular structures will comprise three parts
specification of the structural unit
specification of the wrapping material (geotextile and/or geomembrane) see Chapter 30
specification of the backfill material see Section 21.10
The following properties should be specified for geocellular units and backfill, so that designers can
evaluate their suitability for a specific design application
1 material used in manufacture (including any recycled material)
2 hydraulic properties (including head–discharge relationships if to be used for conveyance)
vertical and horiontal long-term strength over a specified operational time (note that long-term
strength is not only a function of elapsed time, it is also a function of the applied load a unit loaded
with 20 kN/m2 will have a higher strength at 50 years than the same unit loaded with 70 kN/m2
vertical and horiontal strength at specified temperature (if appropriate, eg in hot climates)
5 impact strength if appropriate (eg in cold climates)
6 vertical elastic deflection under short-term traffic loads and under long-term loads

test the performance of sub-base replacement systems)
10 type of backfill and any requirements for compaction plant
11 acceptable test methods or test standards for the above see O’Brien et al (in press)
21.9.2 Plastic arches
There are two ASTM standards that provide guidance on the specification of the properties of plastic arch
systems (one for polypropylene and the other for polyethylene):
corrugated arch chambers manufactured from polypropylene – ASTM F2418-13; the design of these
systems is not covered in detail in this manual
corrugated arch chambers manufactured from polyethylene – ASTM F2922-13e1
The chambers are produced in arch shapes and classifications specify chamber rise, chamber span,
minimum foot width, minimum wall thickness and minimum arch stiffness constant. Chambers are
manufactured with integral footings.
21.9.3 Oversize concrete pipes
Concrete pipes should meet the relevant requirements of BS EN 19162002 and BS 5911-
12002A22010.
21.9.4 Oversize plastic pipes
Polypropylene pipes should meet the relevant provisions of BS EN 152-1199.
All structured wall plastic pipes should comply with the relevant provisions of BS EN 176-12007.
Structured wall pipes with a smooth external surface (includes spiral-wound HDPE pipes) should comply
with the relevant requirements of BS EN 176-22007.
Structured wall pipes with a profiled external surface (includes ribbed pipes) should comply with the
relevant requirements of BS EN 176-2007A12009.
Note that these specifications are limited to a maximum diameter of 900 mm. The relevance of any
particular clause should be carefully considered when applying the standards to larger diameter pipes.
Requirements for oversie plastic pipes are also described in UKWIR (200) and relevant clauses from
this document can also be used in specifications for SuDS.
Pipes manufactured using non-virgin materials should comply with PD CEN/TS 151201.
21.9.5 Corrugated steel pipes
There are no British or European Standards for flexible steel pipes. Corrugated steel pipes used in SuDS
should comply with the relevant requirements of the Specification for Highway Works, Series 2500,
Special Structures (DfT, 2001).

Precast concrete box culverts should meet the requirements of BS EN 12006A22011. This
provides guidance on design, manufacture and installation of culverts.
21.9.7 Glass-reinforced plastic (GRP) tanks.
There are no specific British or European standards that relate to the use of GRP tanks for storage of
surface water. Important properties that should be considered by the designer and specified include
specific gravity of the materials
tensile strength and modulus
flexural strength and modulus
coefficient of thermal expansion
Relevant information from BS EN 1202001 should also be considered.
Hybrid structures using reinforced earth walls and concrete roof panels
The concrete roof panels should comply with the relevant European standards for precast concrete,
The reinforced earth construction should comply with the relevant Eurocodes for aggregates and
geogrids. Geogrids should be CE marked to a recognised harmonised standard or via the European
Organisation for Technical Assessment. The geogrids should comply with BS EN 1251201A12015.
The values of properties that have been used in any stability assessment should be clearly stated in the
specification for each project.
21.9.9 Upstream treatment and inlets
SuDS should be designed to prevent or minimise the risk of sediment ingress into tank systems,
especially geocellular and arch structures. This is because there is limited access, and it can be difficult
to remove sediment build-up once it enters those types of structure. It is especially important to make
sure that runoff during the construction phase is prevented from entering geocellular and arch tanks, as
this has a very high sediment load as well as other debris, which could affect the operation of the tank
(Chapter 31).
As a bare minimum, for any tank a sediment sump should be included within the design immediately
upstream of the tank for on-line systems (eg if water flows through a geocellular tank). Sediment traps
should not be allowed to overfill, as this may cause sediment to be carried into the distribution pipework.
Where sediment cannot be easily removed from tanks, a more effective treatment system should be
provided that is not as reliant on maintenance for its operation (eg filtration into a tank through overlying
soil or using treatment channels). Some systems are configured to enable inspection and jetting of
sediments that migrate from upstream pre-treatment (Figure 21.19). It is important to ensure that practical
access can be gained to the system.
Off-line storage systems are less prone to sedimentation (ie day-to-day flows carrying the majority
of sediment loads bypass the tank). These types of system include the 2D systems that are filled via
perforated pipes as water backs up in the pipe. However, if the water has to pass from the perforated
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
pipe through the 2D tank to another pipe, they
are classified as on-line and thus carry the same
risks. The risk of clogging of any geotextiles that
surround pipes or gravel trenches in those systems
should also be considered.
As a secondary precaution against loss of
performance due to sedimentation in geocellular
tanks, it is common to provide slightly oversied
tanks to allow for some volume loss over time
(typically 10 extra volume is provided by rounding
up the sie of a tank to form a cuboid structure, so
there is no extra cost for this). Table 21.2 provides
potential sediment loads and the potential loss of
storage that could be allowed for over a 50-year
operation period, although this is site specific and
will depend on the volume of storage being provided
for each unit area of contributing catchment.
Sediment forebays or tunnels can also be provided
within tanks, or can be combined with an upstream
and downstream manhole to trap sediment in a
location that is accessible. Figure 21.20 shows
forebays in a geocellular construction combined
with manhole construction at either end of the
tank. However, these should not be considered a
Figure 21.19 Some system configurations allow jetting
equipment to move within the structure (courtesy Aco Limited)
replacement for effective upstream treatment. The
forebay should be easily accessible to clean out. This is the preferred option rather than inspection channels
through the tank because the forebay should be accessible for easy visual inspection without the use of
CCTV. Many manufacturers can supply specific inspection/forebay modules to incorporate into a tank.

21.9.10 Outlets
When used for storage, the structure should have an outlet connecting to the downstream drainage
system or watercourse. All systems should be designed to include an emergency or bypass system to
safely pass flows that exceed the design event, but care should be taken that extreme flood discharges
do not affect downstream buildings and structures.
21.10 MATERIALS
For all types of tank, good quality backfill/bedding/surround is recommended to ensure that adequate
compaction is achieved around the tank and that no voids are left in the backfill.
Chapter 21: Attenuation storage tanks
463
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Figure 21.20 Example of sediment forebay
The specifications generally used for backfill for geocellular units are Class 6N or 6P material for
storage or Type B drainage material in soakaway applications (DfT, 199). However, there are many
other types of backfill. Pipes should use the types of materials assumed in the structural design for the
bedding and surround.
Uncontrolled site-won materials are not recommended in most installations as they may contain debris,
large stones or contaminated materials that could damage the units or penetrate the membranes. There
are examples of failure of geocellular tanks where as-dug very soft clay was used as backfill, with the
material being weaker than granular material assumed in the design. This resulted in greater lateral
pressures on the side of the tank and contributed to its failure. Similar problems have occurred with pipes.
On large projects that have materials sorting and recycling facilities, treated site granular waste could
be utilised once it conforms to the correct specification by being crushed and sieved for example. Care
would have to be taken to ensure that the source was not contaminated with substances that could
damage the installation.
21.11 LANDSCAPE DESIGN AND PLANTING
The main concern with vegetation is to ensure that the tank will not be damaged by tree roots. If
necessary, the tank can be wrapped in a root barrier, or planting of trees close to the tank can be
restricted but in practice this can be difficult to enforce once a development is completed or where
installed close to existing retained vegetation.
21.12 CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS
All tank structures should be constructed in accordance with the good practice guidance for the particular
type of pipe or material and standard drainage requirements (eg WRc, 2012). Analysis and experience
have shown that the successful performance of any systems depends upon the type and depth of
bedding and backfill, and care in installation.
464 Part D: Technical detail
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
The key to the success of a tank system project is a “joined-up thinking” approach between the parties
involved. In a typical overall development there can be a wide variety of people or organisations involved
in the design and construction. Some of those involved in a scheme may lack an appropriate level of
knowledge and there is often a non-formalised design and construction process, which can lead to a
lack of appropriate communication between the parties. Many of the past failures and examples of poor
performance of modular surface water storage using geocellular units and arches can be attributed to
poor communication. In order to achieve the necessary communication between the parties to ensure
success, it is recommended that the existing legal framework and legislation of the CDM 2015 are fully
utilised (see O’Brien et al, in press).
Further detail on construction activities and the programming of construction activities is provided in
Chapter 31.
A construction phase health and safety plan is required under CDM 2015. This should ensure that all
construction risks have been identified, eliminated, reduced and/or controlled where appropriate.
Generic health and safety guidance is provided in Chapter 36.
All attenuation systems should be tested to make sure they are watertight. Pipes and culverts should
meet the requirements in WRc (2012). Systems wrapped in membranes should have membrane and
welds tested as installation progresses.
21.12.1 Handling and protection
The following checks should be carried out:
Quality assurance checks should be carried out on the delivery of products to site and the
installation. This may vary from simple visual observations (eg confirm site geology, check backfilling
of excavations) to monitoring to confirm the performance of the tank for high risk installations.
Check for damage by careless handling or storage on site. Although not usually structurally
significant, if damaged products were used at the edge of a tank, this could cause a tear to any
geomembrane or geotextile surround or could cause a leak at pipe joints.
Check that storage on site is on a flat surface and that the manufacturer’s recommendations
regarding storage are being followed (maximum number of layers, avoid extended exposure to
sunlight, protect from damage etc).
Runoff should be prevented from entering tanks during
construction, unless this has specifically been allowed for,
and sediment can be removed afterwards. Alternatively,
and only if the design allows, a flushing operation may be
required before commissioning, to ensure that all sediments
have been removed from the system.
21.12.2 Excavation
The excavations in which tanked systems are constructed
should be kept free of both groundwater and surface water
runoff. Groundwater control is critically important for the
ease and safety of construction, as well as for excavation
stability but also for the stability of the tank unit (particularly
for geocellular systems). Ingress of groundwater into an
excavation containing a sealed attenuation tank may lead to
failure of the tank by floatation before the backfill is placed
over it. There are instances where surface rainwater from
the top of the tank alone has runoff into the excavation and
caused flotation during construction (Figure 21.21). Figure 21.21 Flotation and movement caused by
rainwater in excavation (courtesy EPG Limited)
Chapter 21: Attenuation storage tanks
465
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Geocellular units and plastic pipes, for example, are very light and typically weigh about 5 kg/m3
. Only
a very small depth of water is required in the base of an excavation to cause a tank, before backfill
placement, to float.
21.12.3 Formation preparation
The base of the excavation on which the tank is founded should be clean, firm and level. If this is not
the case then the units/sections/lengths of pipe will be difficult to place, as they become displaced on
an uneven surface. This can have structural implications and could cause tearing of any membrane or
geotextile surround or leaking joints. Normally a blinding or bedding layer of granular material (sand or
gravel) is placed in the bottom of the excavation.
The base of the excavation should be inspected to ensure that the materials are of sufficient strength to
support the installation and that there are no large stones or other objects that could damage the tank or
penetrate any surrounding geotextile or geomembrane. For clays, a shear strength of greater than 0 kPa
should be adequate. In poor ground conditions, removal of soft materials and/or extra granular or blinding
materials may be required to form an adequate foundation. Sub-base replacement geocellular units
that act as a raft can often support light loading on soils with a CBR value of 2% and have been used to
construct floating permeable pavements over very poor ground in the Netherlands.
Also, the base conditions and loadings/support should be uniform across the installation. Most types of
tank can be particularly vulnerable to load concentrations that could occur if a tank spanned across old
foundations creating a hard spot, for instance.
21.12.4 Placing and assembling units/pipes/products
All types of tanks should be placed and assembled in accordance with the relevant standards,
specifications and guidance.
Where geocellular systems are stacked more than one layer high, care should be taken to ensure that
the units are correctly positioned on top of each other with relevant layer connectors used, if required, to
ensure adequate load transfer from the top to the base of the installation. Some crate systems use pillars
of one form or another, and failure to ensure that these pillars are positioned directly above each other will
lead to a lower load capability of the installation.
afiin
For any tank the bedding, backfill or surround is critical to the structural performance, and it should
comply with all assumptions made by the designer.
In untrafficked situations, excavations can generally be backfilled with selected, as-dug material that
does not contain large particles or sharp materials. It should then be well compacted. In trafficked
areas, the use of well-compacted backfill and cover is particularly important, and the material should,
typically, be selected in accordance with standard highway or drainage works specifications (eg HA,
1996b, or WRc, 2012). Use of poor quality backfill can significantly increase lateral earth pressures on
tanks, and cause collapse. Running heavy plant over constructed tanks or stockpiling material over
them during construction, when such loads have not been included within design calculations, can
also cause collapse, especially if temporary cover during site works is less than the final design cover
depth. Any geomembrane wrapping may need to be protected from the backfill by a geotextile fleece in
some instances. In all cases, advice should be sought from individual manufacturers regarding specific
recommended installation and cover depths.
Compacting backfill around the sides of some types of tank with plant that is too heavy can cause
large deflections in the sides, with a resulting structural implication. Lightweight man-operated plate
compactors are generally recommended for the perimeter and the first layers above the tank, as
compaction can apply high lateral pressures. Where compaction pressures have to be avoided, but a
stable backfill is required, weakly cemented no fines concrete can be considered.
466 Part D: Technical detail
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Heavy vibrating rollers are definitely not recommended around plastic pipes or tanks due to the high
pressures that they can generate. Thin layers with smaller plant are recommended. DfT (2009) should
be referred to for guidance for plant and methods for achieving compaction. The manufacturers’
recommendations usually limit plant sie above geocellular units to no more than 200 kg/m width.
However, the loading resulting from this will still need to be checked in the design. If such plant is to be
used adjacent to the units, the resulting compaction pressures need to be checked.
Any arch or flexible pipe structures depend on the even resistance provided from soil or aggregate on
both sides of the arch/pipe for their structural capacity. Even slight differences in the level of filling on
each side of the arch/pipe as it progresses could potentially cause uneven deflections and increase the
stress within the structure above design values. Close supervision during backfilling is therefore vital. The
backfill around geocellular tanks should also be brought up evenly around all sides.
Bedding directly below a concrete pipe should have minimal compaction. The fill at the side of the pipe
should be well compacted to a level 00 mm above the crown of the pipe. Only light compaction should
be applied to the backfill directly over the crown of the pipe to a point 00 mm above it. With reasonable
workmanship and supervision, the bedding factors used in the design should be relatively conservative.
21.12.6 Wrapping
All storage tanks should be watertight in accordance with the relevant standards. Geocellular and similar
structures using geomembranes to hold water should be sealed in accordance with waterproofing
standards (ie welded joints rather than adhesive taped) and the integrity of the seal checked on site
through the use of non-destructive testing, to ensure that it is leak-proof. Advice on appropriate integrity
and seam tests for geomembranes, that could be adapted for testing membranes around storage tanks,
is provided in Mallett et al (201). Care needs to be taken during installation to protect against damage
of both the tank structure and the geotextile and the geomembrane wrapping. Follow-on trades can also
cause damage and put the integrity and performance of the structure at risk.
21.13 OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS
Regular inspection and maintenance is required to ensure the effective long-term operation of below-
ground storage systems. Maintenance responsibility for systems should be placed with a responsible
organisation. Table 21.3 provides guidance on the type of operational and maintenance requirements that
may be appropriate. The list of actions is not exhaustive and some actions may not always be required.
Maintenance Plans and schedules should be developed during the design phase, and will be specific
to the type of tank that is adopted. Specific maintenance needs of the system should be monitored, and
maintenance schedules adjusted to suit requirements. Further detail on the preparation of maintenance
specifications and schedules of work is given in Chapter 32.
CDM 2015 requires designers to ensure that all maintenance risks have been identified, eliminated,
reduced and/or controlled where appropriate. This information will be required as part of the health and
safety file.
Generic health and safety guidance is provided in Chapter 36.

22Chapter Detention basins
This chapter provides guidance on the design of detention basins
– landscaped depressions that are normally dry except during and
following rainfall events, designed to attenuate runoff and, where
vegetated, provide treatment.
Appendix C, Section C.5.3 demonstrates how to design a detention basin for a
supermarket.
22.1 GENERAL DESCRIPTION
Detention basins are landscaped depressions that are normally dry except during and
immediately following storm events. They can be on-line components where surface
runoff from regular events is routed through the basin and when the flows rise, because
the outlet is restricted, the basin fills and provides storage of runoff and flow attenuation.
They can also be off-line components into which runoff is diverted once flows reach a
specified threshold.
Detention basins can be vegetated depressions (that can provide treatment when
designed to manage regular flows) or hard landscaped storage areas (that will tend not
to provide any treatment and are normally designed as off-line components).
Where the basin is vegetated, the soil surface can absorb some runoff, so can be used
to support the prevention of runoff from the site for small rainfall events (Interception),
provided that small amounts of infiltration would not pose a risk to groundwater. The
principal water quality benefits of vegetated detention basins are associated with the
removal of sediment and buoyant materials, but levels of nutrients, heavy metals, toxic
materials and oxygen-demanding materials may also be significantly reduced. The
water quality benefits of a vegetated detention basin increase as the detention time for
an event becomes longer. Where designed appropriately, some or all of the basin area
can also be used as a recreational or other amenity facility (Figure 22.1).
Figure 22.1 Hamilton, Leicester
Detention basin with landscape design providing attractive amenity space,
Chapter 22: Detention basins
473
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Off-line detention basins will normally have an alternative principal use: either as an amenity or
recreational facility, or as part of urban hard landscaping.
Where there is no upstream pre-treatment, on-line detention basins should include a forebay to try to
contain accumulating sediments, although this can result in unusable and unattractive areas, which may
not be acceptable for public open space.
For maximum pollutant removal effectiveness in vegetated basins, flows should be distributed across the
full width of the basin. However, where there are concerns about keeping a proportion of the base of the
basin dry, a discrete area of the basin can be lowered to constrain frequent events within a specified area.
Constraining low flows to specific routes can provide multi-functionality benefits and reduce the risks of
the base of the basin becoming wet and boggy.
Vegetated detention basins can be designed with a small permanent pool at the outlet to help prevent
resuspension of sediment particles by high intensity storms and to provide enhanced water quality
treatment for frequent events. Any open water element would require effective integration into the
landscape, and consideration would be required of the risk of the pond drying out during the summer,
potentially causing plant die off. An ephemeral pool could be valuable from a biodiversity perspective,
but it may look unattractive, and this requires careful consideration by the designer (eg evaluation of
appropriate minimum depths or appropriate marginal planting).
Detention basins are frequently used for temporary sediment control during construction. It is essential that they
are reinstated or reconstructed at the end of construction and before adoption by the maintaining authority.
Figure 22.2 provides a typical plan view and profile for the design of a detention basin.
Figure 22.2 Plan and elevation of vegetated detention basin
22.2 GENERAL DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS
The form and aesthetic appearance of the component will depend on specific site characteristics,
474 Part D: Technical detail
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
landscape/amenity objectives and development design criteria. Unless used for a sports pitch or to fit into
some specific landscape, vegetated detention basins should not normally follow a geometric profile, but
they should have edges with curves and undulations to produce an aesthetically interesting and natural-
looking feature.
The maximum depth of water in the basin should not normally exceed 2 m in the most extreme design
event. However, many authorities will require a much lower maximum depth, for safety reasons.
The bottom of any vegetated basin should be fairly flat with a gentle slope (no more than 1 in 100)
towards the outlet, to maximise contact of runoff with the vegetation and to prevent standing water
conditions from developing. Areas above the normal high water elevations of the basin should also be
sloped towards the basin to allow effective drainage. The base of the basin can also be provided with a
layer of engineered soil or underdrains to maintain a firm and dry surface.
The recommended length/width ratio for on-line vegetated detention basins is between 3:1 and 5:1. Inlets
and outlets should be placed to maximise the flow path through the facility. Contoured bases can be
effectively used to define and lengthen areas that are likely to be wetted regularly.
A liner may be required to maintain the water level in any small permanent water feature, prevent
infiltration of runoff where water quality risk assessment indicates that this is not acceptable and/or to
protect an underlying aquifer.
Where swales are used as low flow channels, their design should follow guidance set out in Chapter 17.
Filter trenches could also be used to convey low flows, but these will require very effective upstream pre-
treatment so that the risk of reduced performance due to blockage is controlled, and will deliver limited
treatment themselves. The use of filter trenches also carries high maintenance and erosion risks associated
with movement of filter material during moderate to high flow events, and any designs should ensure that
such risks are adequately managed.
Any embankment should be designed in accordance with best practice, as described in Kennard et al
(1996). Designs should meet all requirements of the Reservoir Act 1975, as amended by the Flood and
Water Management Act 2010. Even if the impounded basin does not come within the thresholds of the
Reservoirs Act, owners still have statutory duties for the safety of others under legislation such as the
Health and Safety at Work (etc) Act 197 and the Building Act 19. Consideration should be given to
the safe routing of floodwater when the design event is exceeded, and to mitigating the risks of potential
embankment failure.
Side slopes of any vegetated basin should not usually exceed 1 in 3 unless special site and/or safety
arrangements allow for steeper slopes (eg steeper slopes may be acceptable for very shallow basins).
Slopes should be no steeper than 1 in wherever mowing is required, to reduce the risks associated with
maintenance activities. Flatter slopes tend to improve the aesthetics, at the expense of extra land-take.
Hard landscaped basins will often have vertical sides, but will tend to be very shallow.
There should always be appropriate access to the detention basin for maintenance activities such as
grass cutting and sediment removal to be undertaken, and to all inlets, outlets and control structures.
Maintenance access can often be integrated with routes for general public access, which can help in
discouraging heavy use of wider basin slopes that can potentially create erosion risks.
Health and safety risk management design guidance is provided in Chapter 36. Safety principles in
relation to public use are set out in Section 22.6.
22.3 SELECTION AND SITING OF DETENTION BASINS
Detention basins are generally applicable to most types of development, and can be used in both
residential and non-residential areas. They are also appropriate for use in retrofit situations (where
existing drainage network levels and land availability allow).
Chapter 22: Detention basins
475
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
They can often be designed as multi-functional spaces, creating an open area within a development, part
of which can be made available for recreational purposes. Roundabouts can also often provide suitable
space that is redundant within the existing or proposed development landscape.

Stirling (courtesy Abertay University)
Figure 22. Detention basin in a roundabout, DEX,
Dunfermline (courtesy Abertay University)
Historic records of groundwater level should be checked to ensure that during periods of high groundwater,
the storage capacity of the detention basin is retained and that hydraulic connectivity between the surface
water runoff and the groundwater is acceptable from a water quality perspective. If a liner is used, there is a
risk that the liner may float during periods of high groundwater levels. A seasonally high groundwater table
may not always impede the proper functioning of the facility, but it can result in a muddy base that may be
considered unattractive if not developed into a permanent wetland feature.
Unlined detention basins should not be used on brownfield sites unless it has been clearly demonstrated
that there is no risk of groundwater pollution. Any excavation or earthmoving processes required should
be assessed to ensure that mobilisation of contamination does not occur. Unlined detention basins should
not be used to treat runoff from hotspots if there is a risk of groundwater pollution.
For catchments of less than three hectares, outlet throttle diameters may have to be very small (ie 150
mm diameter) in order to achieve pre-development outflow rates. This may mean that they risk clogging
and special attention should be given to the design of the outlet area and flow control. Where a micropool
at the outlet is required, the soil below the pool area should be sufficiently impermeable to maintain the
permanent pool, unless a continuous baseflow or high groundwater table is present. In highly permeable
strata, a liner will be required to prevent the pool from drying out.
22.4 HYDRAULIC DESIGN
22.4.1 General
Guidance on hydraulic criteria and design standards is given in Chapter 3 and methods for sizing storage
are presented in Chapter 24. Detention basins can be sied to provide flood attenuation for all events to
meet the site standards of service (up to the 110, 10 or 1100 year events), if required, with discharges
being constrained to the equivalent greenfield (or other agreed) rates. Consideration should be given
to larger events, as these will need to be safely routed downstream. Basin volumes may need to be
increased if additional storage is required to deliver volumetric control of runoff for the 1:100 year event
(Section 22.4.4).
Detention basins may be constructed as on-line or off-line facilities. On-line facilities have surface runoff
routed through them during storm events. They have a restricted outflow that allows the basin to fill, thus
attenuating flows. Off-line facilities usually receive runoff via a flow diverter or overflow, by which flows in
excess of a threshold value are diverted from the main flow path into the detention basin and temporarily
476 Part D: Technical detail
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
stored. The water from the detention basin is passed back into the main system when the inflow falls
below the diversion threshold. Off-line detention basins should be avoided where treatment of the runoff
is important, because it is the lower flows that will generally pose the highest pollution risk.
22.4.2 Interception design
Vegetated detention basins can deliver some Interception because there tends to be no runoff from them
for the majority of small rainfall events. The water soaks into the basin topsoil layer and is removed by
evapotranspiration and even very small amounts of infiltration (where this is allowed). The extent of the
volumetric reduction in runoff to surface waters will depend on the infiltration rate of the surrounding soil,
the catchment area, the area and depth of the system, the type of vegetation and the climate.
Where there is infiltration capacity, infiltration is acceptable, and the detention basin is designed to
facilitate even limited infiltration, then a check should be made to determine whether the basin is able to
dispose of 5 mm rainfall depth over the contributing catchment area.
Where there is no infiltration, but the natural surface soils (or imported/re-engineered soils) have water
storage capacity, then Interception design should follow the principles set out in Section 24.8. Hard
landscaped basins will not deliver Interception.
ea o ontro desin
Detention basins can help reduce flow rates from a site by controlling the discharge rate and allowing
the basin storage to fill during storm events. The required peak flow control and storage volume can be
determined using standard hydraulic assessment (Chapter 24).
22.4.4 Volume control design
Detention basins do not normally contribute to volumetric control of runoff, but can be used as Long-Term
Storage areas, or to deliver further attenuation where Long-Term Storage is not practical (Chapter 3).
Assessment of volumetric control should follow the normal hydraulic assessment methods in Chapter 24.
eedane o desin
An exceedance flow route will be required for rainfall events that exceed the design capacity of the
detention basin. This can be achieved by installing an overflow pipe, channel or weir/overflow structure
above the design water storage level to convey excess flows downstream.
The exceedance flow capacity of the overflow should be confirmed using normal hydraulic assessment
methods and analysis (weir, orifice and pipe flow). Exceedance flows beyond the capacity of the overflow
should also be confirmed.
Any exceedance flow structure should be located as close to the inlet as possible to minimise the flow
path length for above-capacity flows, thus reducing the risk of scouring. See Section 22.8.2 on outlet
design for details. The overflow should not impede access to any inlet/outlet/control structure that
manages more frequent flows.
Detention basins are often used as off-line systems to manage exceedance flows from the main
surface water management system. In this case, they will normally have an alternative principal use, for
example as a dedicated amenity/recreational facility. Further guidance on designing for exceedance flow
management is set out in Section 24.12.
22.5 TREATMENT DESIGN
Vegetated detention basins can help retain runoff from small events on site (ie deliver Interception,
Section 22.4.2), helping reduce the contaminant load via volumetric control. They can also treat the
Chapter 22: Detention basins
477
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
residual runoff, primarily via the gravitational settling of particulate pollutants, although some filtration will
occur through the vegetation on the basin base and underlying soils together with biodegradation and
photolytic breakdown of hydrocarbons during the drying processes between runoff events.
Figure 22.5 Example of urban hard surfaced off-line detention basin with geometric design to enhance amenity use,
Rotterdam, the Netherlands (courtesy palleshaarfane)
The key to delivering reasonable levels of treatment using vegetated detention basins is the effective
capture and management of sediments, and the distribution of inflows across a sufficient width of the
detention basin thus maximising the potential vegetated filtration area. Small ponds can be incorporated
at the outlet to reduce the risks of resuspension of sediment from larger events and can also improve the
water quality performance by concentrating finer sediment (Section 22.10).
Good pollutant removal performance is required for all runoff events up to and including events which
occur, on average, about once a year (termed here the 11 year return period event). The duration of this
event should be the relevant critical duration for the detention basin. For this water quality design event
(for a vegetated basin)
the depth of flow should be maintained below the height of vegetation (ie usually 100 mm)
the maximum flow velocity in the basin for such an event should be 0. m/s to ensure adequate
runoff filtration
the time of travel of runoff from inlet to outlet of the basin (residence time length/velocity) should be
at least 9 minutes.
To calculate the average velocity of flow in the basin, Manning’s equation should be used (Section 24.11.1). The
Manning’s n value, or the roughness coefficient indicates to what extent the surface of the basin will resist flow
and is critical in its siing. The coefficient varies with type of vegetative cover and the flow depth and a suggested
relationship between flow depth and Manning’s n for grass channels is given in Chapter 17, Figure 17.7.
Evidence of the pollutant removal efficiencies of vegetated detention basins is presented in Chapter 26,
Annex 3.
22.6 AMENITY DESIGN
Detention basins can be important parts of the landscape design for public open space defining the
topography for green or hard landscaped areas. Basin design can take many forms, from naturalistic
and irregular to formal and geometric. This will depend on the planned future use of the space and the
478 Part D: Technical detail
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
landscape, amenity and biodiversity objectives for the site. The value of basins can often be enhanced
with footpaths or cycle paths, and enhanced with structural and diverse plants, wetland planted areas and
wildflower mixes to enhance their beauty and amenity contribution.
Detention basins may be constructed to serve more than one purpose, and can be used as car parks,
playgrounds or sports fields. When constructed for multiple purposes, the detention basin should be
usable for the function other than surface water detention for most of the time. Where multi-functional
use is intended, the recreational area should normally have a relatively low flooding frequency such as
15 year return period, depending on its use. Interpretation boards explaining that the area is part of the
drainage system and that it could be filled with water may also be required.
Where detention basins form an integral part of public open space or recreational play areas, it is crucially
important that those using or living near the facility are aware of its functionality and value. How to involve the
community in this way is discussed in Chapter 34 and planting best practice is presented in Chapter 29.
Fencing is generally not desirable as it may reduce the amenity benefits provided by the detention facility,
provide a barrier to easy maintenance and provide a trap where litter and dead vegetation can collect.
Where fences are required, they should be low (toddler-proof), but allow movement of wildlife. Gentle
slopes and appropriate planting can contribute to minimising public safety risks.
Inlet and outlet pipes and culverts should not be accessible. The headwalls of large pipes should be
fenced to prevent accidents and deter access. Grilles should also be considered to prevent entry into
the pipe but these tend to clog rapidly, triggering more regular maintenance requirements and potentially
affecting hydraulic performance (Chapter 28).
Life-saving equipment should only be provided where required by the risk assessment, and operators will
have to inspect such equipment on a regular basis to minimise any liability risks.
22.7 BIODIVERSITY DESIGN
By following the biodiversity criteria in Chapter 6, biodiversity value of any SuDS component can be
maximised. Vegetated detention basins can include a variety of structurally diverse planting that will
help make a positive contribution to urban biodiversity providing habitat and food for invertebrates and
birds. Some plants and animals specifically require ephemeral water bodies as part of their life cycle, and
suitable wildflower mixes can provide important nectar sources for insects. Where space allows, multiple
basins of varying sie and shape should be created, and consideration given to the inclusion of shelves
and shallow graded sides, undulating surfaces and convoluted edges to provide the greatest wildlife
value. The ecological value of the system can also be enhanced by including micropools or wetland
zones at the base. Further guidance is given in Chapters 6 and 29.
22.8 PHYSICAL SPECIFICATIONS
22.8.1 Pre-treatment and inlets
For on-line systems the number of inlets to the basin should be limited, preferably to one. The flow path
length should be maximised from inlet to outlet for all inlets.
For basins serving large developments, a sediment forebay or upstream pre-treatment component will
improve the water quality performance of a vegetated detention basin and reduce long-term maintenance
requirements. The plan area of the sedimentation bay should be at least 10% of the total basin area and
could consist of a separate basin or be formed by building an earth berm, stone or rock-filled gabion or
rip-rap across the upstream portion of the basin. For systems with multiple inlets, pre-treatment should
be provided for each inlet that is likely to contribute a significant sediment load. Each forebay should be
accessible and easily maintained. Consideration should be given to installing a fixed sediment depth
marker in the forebay to measure sediment deposition with time. This will assist with the development of
appropriate maintenance schedules.
Chapter 22: Detention basins
479
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
The energy of the incoming flows should be dissipated to minimise the risk of scouring and erosion.
This can be achieved by stabilising inflow channels using rip-rap or other erosion control systems. The
scale of the erosion mitigation system required will be dependent on incoming flow velocities, but should
be physically and aesthetically proportionate to the size of the basin. Safety grilles may be required if
inlet pipe diameters allow public entry, but they tend to increase the risks of blockage and can present a
haard in themselves so, wherever possible, inlet infrastructure should be designed so that they are not
required. Inlet designs should blend with the landscape – detailed guidance on inlet designs can be found
in Chapter 28.
22.8.2 Underdrains and outlets
At the outlet, there will normally be a requirement for some form of flow control system. A manhole-type
outlet structure can accommodate a variety of outlet control mechanisms. Detention basins will generally
require a non-clogging, variable flow rate control structure at the outlet, together with an emergency
overflow. Low flow controls are generally provided via protected orifices, which can then be combined
with overflow channels and overflow weir sections and/or culverts for larger events. Multiple orifices or
pipe outlets can be used to achieve the same objectives. Trash screens are not recommended, but where
grilles are necessary to prevent access into the pipework, they should be designed so that debris does
not unduly obstruct or reduce design flow rates.
Energy dissipation may be required downstream of the outlet to prevent scouring and erosion, but this
will depend on the outflow discharge rates, the outfall design and the vulnerability of the receiving
watercourse or lake to erosion.
For outlet pipes through embankments, seepage control in the form of collars may need to be provided.
The design of exceedance flow management components is discussed in Section 22.4.5.
Outlet design should be appropriate and complementary to the local landscape. Detailed guidance on
outlet designs can be found in Chapter 28.
22.9 MATERIALS
There are no unique materials that are used in detention basins. Subsoil, topsoil, geotextile,
geomembrane and filter drain aggregate specifications are provided in Chapter 30.
22.10 LANDSCAPE DESIGN AND PLANTING
Detention basin design should take account of the local landscape and local environment. It should be
site specific, and individual designs should be developed to deliver the required amenity and biodiversity
objectives for the site.
Detention basins are typically grassed structures, although some other vegetation can enhance the
appearance and amenity value of the basin, stabilise side slopes and prevent erosion, serve as wildlife
habitat, and partially conceal unsightly litter and debris. It can also help increase the effectiveness of
sediment settling by slowing the flows across the basin.
Topsoil depths will vary for different planting proposals, so 100 mm of subsoil may be suitable for
wildflower meadow surfacing, 150 mm topsoil is required for amenity grass and 50 mm will be
necessary for planted areas. This should be a high-quality topsoil with a loam or sandy loam texture.
Where small pools are included as a feature of the basin, they are normally planted with wetland
vegetation species. There is normally a risk that the pool may dry out during summer months, so pool
depths and marginal plants should be selected to reduce any potential consequences.
Reinforced grass may be required for maintenance routes where vehicular access is anticipated.

22.11 CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS
The bottom and side slopes of the basin should be carefully prepared to ensure that they are structurally
sound and the grading should be uniform and smooth to the correct slope so that water does not pond in
depressions and to minimise the risk of channelling and erosion through preferential flow paths. Checks
should be made that any embankment structures meet their design criteria. The preparation should also
ensure that the basin will satisfactorily manage design flows without significant erosion damage.
Backfilling against inlet and outlet structures needs to be controlled so as to minimise settlement and
erosion. The soils used to finish the side slopes need to be suitably fertile, porous and of sufficient depth
to ensure healthy vegetation growth. If an impermeable liner is used, care should be taken to ensure that
it is not damaged during construction.
During the SuDS establishment phase, runoff from bare soils should be minimised. For example
vegetation on slopes should be rapidly established
base-of-slope trenches should be introduced to retain the inevitable runoff of sediments
construction should be timed to avoid autumn and winter when high runoff rates are to be expected.
Detention basins may be used to manage construction runoff and trap construction sediments, provided
they are fully rehabilitated to original design formation levels before handover.
Further detail on construction activities and the programming of construction activities is provided in Chapter 31.
Generic health and safety guidance is provided in Chapter 36. A construction phase health and safety plan is
required under the Construction (Design and Management) Regulations (CDM) 2015. This should ensure that all
construction risks have been identified, eliminated, reduced and/or controlled where appropriate.
22.12 OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS
Detention basins will require ongoing regular maintenance to ensure continuing operation to design
performance standards, and all designers should provide detailed specifications and frequencies for
the required maintenance activities along with likely machinery requirements and typical annual costs
– within the Maintenance Plan. The treatment performance of bioretention systems is dependent on
maintenance, and robust management plans will be required to ensure maintenance is carried out in the
long term. Different designs will have different operation and maintenance requirements, but this section
gives some generic guidance.
Maintenance of detention basins is relatively straightforward for landscape contractors, and typically
there should only be a small amount of extra work (if any) required for a SuDS detention basin over and
above what is necessary for standard public open space.
Chapter 22: Detention basins
481
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Maintenance responsibility for a basin should always be placed with an appropriate organisation.
Adequate access should be provided to all detention basin areas for inspection and maintenance,
including for appropriate equipment and vehicles. Litter and debris removal should be undertaken as part
of general landscape maintenance for the site and before any other SuDS management task. All litter
should be removed from site.
The major maintenance requirement for detention basins is usually mowing. Regular mowing in and around
detention basins is only required along maintenance access routes, amenity areas (eg footpaths), across
any embankment and across the main storage area. The remaining areas can be managed as meadow,
unless additional management is required for landscape/amenity/recreational or aesthetic reasons.
Mowing should ideally retain grass lengths of 75150 mm across the main treatment surface to assist
in filtering pollutants and retaining sediments and to reduce the risk of flattening during runoff events.
Longer lengths of vegetation may be appropriate, depending on the functionality of the component, and
its associated design criteria and are not considered to pose a significant risk to functionality.
Shorter lengths may be required when recreational facilities form part of the basin, but in this case the
basin will be dealing with exceedance flows only and not treatment.
Grass clippings should be disposed of off-site or outside the detention basin area to remove nutrients
and pollutants. Where a detention basin has a small permanent pool at the outlet, its submerged and
emergent aquatic vegetation should be managed as for ponds or wetlands. Plant management, to
achieve the desired habitat effect, should be clearly specified in a maintenance schedule. All vegetation
management activities should take account of the need to maximise biosecurity and prevent the spread
of invasive species.
Occasionally sediment will need to be removed (eg once deposits exceed 25 mm in depth). Sediments
excavated from a detention basin that receives runoff from residential or standard road and roof areas
are generally not toxic or hazardous and can therefore be safely disposed of by either land application
or landfilling. However, consultation should take place with the environmental regulator to confirm
appropriate protocols. Sediment testing may be required before sediment excavation to determine
its classification and appropriate disposal methods. For runoff from busy streets with high vehicle
traffic, sediment testing will be essential. In the majority of cases, it will be acceptable to distribute the
sediment on-site if there is an appropriate safe and acceptable location to do so. Further detail on waste
management is provided in Chapter 32. Any damage due to sediment removal or erosion and scour
resulting from major events should be repaired and immediately reseeded or planted.
Table 22.1 provides guidance on the type of operational and maintenance requirements that may be
appropriate. The list of actions is not exhaustive and some actions may not always be required.
Maintenance Plans and schedules should be developed during the design phase. Specific maintenance
needs of the detention basins should be monitored, and maintenance schedules adjusted to suit
requirements. Further detail on the preparation of maintenance specifications and schedules of work is
given in Chapter 32.
Generic health and safety guidance is provided in Chapter 36. CDM 2015 requires designers to ensure
that all maintenance risks have been identified, eliminated, reduced and/or controlled where appropriate.
This information will be required as part of the health and safety file.
Many of the specific maintenance activities for detention basins can be undertaken as part of a general
landscape management contract and therefore, if landscape management is already required at site,
should have marginal cost implications. If basins are implemented within private property, owners should
be educated on their routine maintenance needs, and should understand the long-term Maintenance Plan
and any legally binding maintenance agreement.

23Chapter Ponds and wetlands
This chapter provides guidance on the design of ponds – depressions
designed to temporarily store surface water above permanently wet
pools that permit settlement of suspended solids and biological removal
of pollutants. This includes wetlands, which are ponds with a higher
proportion of shallow zones that promote the growth of bottom-rooted
plants.
Appendix C, Section C.5.4 demonstrates how to design a wetland area for an
industrial site.
Appendix C, Section C.5.5 demonstrates how to design a strategic amenity pond.
23.1 GENERAL DESCRIPTION
Ponds and wetlands are features with a permanent pool of water that provide both
attenuation and treatment of surface water runoff. They can support emergent and
submerged aquatic vegetation along their shoreline and in shallow, marshy (wetland)
zones, which helps enhance treatment processes and has amenity and biodiversity
benefits. Dense stands of vegetation facilitate the adhesion of contaminants to
vegetation, aerobic decomposition of pollutants and can also help stabilise settled
sediment and prevent resuspension. The term “wetland” is used to describe bodies of
water with larger proportions of the surface area covered by aquatic planting. They also
tend to have greater depth variations and may include shallow islands. However, for the
purposes of this document, ponds and wetlands are considered together.
Attenuation storage is provided above the permanent pool and wetland areas. A flow
control system at the outfall controls the rates of discharge for a range of water levels,
causing the pond volume to fill during storm events. Runoff from each rainfall event is
detained and treated in the pool. The volume of the pool influences the effectiveness
of the feature in settling out particulate pollutants, with larger volumes providing longer
periods of time for sedimentation to occur, and greater opportunities for biodegradation
and biological uptake mechanisms.
Ponds and wetlands should always be designed with suitable upstream pre-treatment
systems (or separate sediment forebays) in place. This prevents open water features
from becoming unsightly and odorous and reduces the risk of rapid silt accumulation,
which is generally expensive and difficult to extract and dispose of. Ponds and wetlands
perform a valuable function in settling out residual fine silts and in final polishing of
surface water runoff before discharge.
Well-designed and maintained permanent water bodies can offer important aesthetic,
amenity and wildlife benefits to development sites. Ponds can be designed as natural
features with shallow, grassed side slopes (Figure 23.1) or can be hard landscaped
features that complement the character of dense urban environments. Well-managed
ponds and wetlands can add significant economic value to a development, increasing
property values and attracting business and tourism. Public acceptability of ponds is
strongly dependent on their aesthetic quality, on their effective integration within the
landscape and on their performance as a community resource, so their form, layout and
planting should usually be designed and specified by landscape architects. They should
not be designed by engineers without landscape architecture expertise.

Ponds and wetlands can be created by using an existing natural depression, by excavating a new
depression, or by constructing embankments. Existing natural water bodies should not be used as a
means by which to dispose of surface water runoff where this would create a risk that pollution events,
poorer water quality or alternative flow regimes might disturb/damage the natural morphology and/or
ecology of the system. There may, however, be scenarios where existing water bodies would benefit from
further inputs of cleaned surface water runoff. Locating SuDS ponds and wetlands close to existing ones
can also benefit biodiversity.
The design of ponds/wetlands should consider the inclusion of a number of ones
1 Sediment forebay (optional) – Effective pre-treatment (that removes coarse sediments and floating
oils) should ideally be implemented via appropriate source control and upstream SuDS Management
Train components. Where there are residual sediment risks, or where a sediment forebay is the only
suitable management option at the site, then the pond can be split to allow coarse sediments to settle
in the forebay before the runoff enters the permanent pool. The forebay allows sediment build-up to
be easily monitored, and concentrates any required sediment removal activities within a small area,
thereby minimising potential damage to the rest of the pond.
2 Permanent pool This is the permanent volume of water that will remain in the pond/wetland
throughout the year (less any evaporation and infiltration during extended periods of dry weather).
The pool acts as the main treatment one and helps to protect fine deposited sediments from
resuspension. The top water level for this volume should be at the invert level of the outlet structure,
unless an infiltration depth is included (ie a depth between outlet invert level and top elevation of
liner over which infiltration is encouraged to take place). In larger wetlands, this pool volume may be
distributed into a number of “micropools”.
3 Attenuation storage volume – This is the temporary storage volume above the permanent pool that
fills as water levels rise during rainfall events, providing the required flow attenuation.
4 Aquatic bench – This is the zone of shallow water along the edge of the permanent pool that
supports wetland planting, acting as a biological filter and providing ecology, amenity and safety
benefits. Where the proportion of planting is increased (ie to create wetland features), there may be
other “islands” (zones of shallow, vegetated areas) within the permanent pool.
Where there is a high proportion of shallow water, the extent of water loss by evapotranspiration should
be taken into account to ensure that there is likely to be sufficient water supply to sustain good wetland
plant growth through the year.
Design features should also include a safe exceedance route, maintenance access to all areas of
the pond, a flat safety bench around the perimeter of the pond (to provide a suitable distance before
open water (this discourages direct access and facilitates surveillance of the pond and rescue if
486 Part D: Technical detail
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
required) and also usually acts as
a maintenance route). Access for
maintenance to smaller features
may often just be an easement with
sufficient space and gradients to allow
access by mini excavators.
Larger ponds should, preferably, be
divided into zones – providing the
water quality and quantity volume
storage in a number of independent
cells. These can create increased
attenuation, longer pollutant removal
pathways (and therefore enhanced
pollution removal), an easier
maintenance regime and more varied
ecology. They also allow
Figure 23.3 Wetland, Banner Country Park, Upton, Northamptonshire
enhanced biodiversity – with lower zones tending to comprise cleaner water

each of the zones.

23.2 GENERAL DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS
Ponds should be designed so that flow enters
the pond and gradually spreads out, avoiding the
creation of dead zones caused by corners, and
optimising the sedimentation process through
maximising the flow paths. Baffles, pond shaping
and islands can be added within the permanent
pool to increase the flow path length and maximise
water quality treatment effectiveness (Chapter 28)
(Figure 23.7).
Inlets and outlets should be placed to maximise
the flow path through the facility. The ratio of flow
path length to width should be at least 1 to avoid
hydraulic short-circuiting and ideally 1 or 51. If
there are multiple inlets, they should all follow this
principle ideally, but as a minimum the length-to-
width ratio should be based on the flow-weighted,
average flow path length for all inlets.
A balance is required between deep and shallow
zones in a pond or wetland. The maximum depth
of the permanent pool should not exceed 2 m to
avoid stratification and anoxic conditions (and
should normally be a maximum of 1.2 m, unless
Figure 2.7 Sweden
Pond with baffles and islands, Augustenborg,
all safety considerations indicate that a greater
depth is acceptable). Keeping the permanent water shallow allows oxygen to reach the bottom of the
pond, enabling the biodegradation of oils by natural organisms; however, very shallow ponds may be
at risk of algal blooms and high biological activity during summer months, and may be at risk of drying
out when rainfall is low, therefore some depths of 0.6–1.0 m should usually be included. Greater depths
near the outlet will reduce the risk of sediment re-entrainment, and will tend to yield cooler bottom water
discharges that may mitigate downstream thermal effects. Deep water supports a relatively few number of
plant species compared to shallow zones, so the overall extent of deep water zones should be considered
and limited.
The maximum depth of temporary storage above the permanent pool should be limited 0.5 m is usually
appropriate for small to medium-sized ponds, but increased depths may be suitable for larger systems
or where the risks can be demonstrated to have been managed appropriately. Surface water wetlands
are generally chosen to improve runoff quality, rather than for controlling large volumes of surface water.
Where wetlands are used for flow attenuation, the depth of temporary storage above the permanent water
level should be such that the risk of plant damage is low.
An aquatic bench should be provided that extends inwards from the normal pond edge and has a
maximum depth of 0.4 m below the normal pool water surface elevation. The width can be varied
depending on the size of the pond and the extent of vegetation required for safety and aesthetic
purposes. On most pond sites, it is important to amend the soil before planting, since ponds are typically
placed well below the native soil horion. In very poor soils nutrient additions should be minimised owing
to the risk of algal blooms and eutrophication.
Any pond embankment should be designed in accordance with best practice, as described in Kennard
et al (1996). Designs should meet all requirements of the Reservoir Act 1975 as amended by the Flood
and Water Management Act 2010. Even if the impounded pond does not come within the thresholds of
the Reservoirs Act, owners still have statutory duties for the safety of others under legislation such as
the Health and Safety at Work (etc) Act 1974 and the Building Act 1984. Consideration should be given to
the safe routing of floodwater when the design event is exceeded, and to mitigating the risks of potential
embankment failure.
Chapter 23: Ponds and wetlands
489
23.3 CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Safety benches and maintenance access routes should be provided at an appropriate level above the permanent
pond. A suitable width for a safety bench is 3.5 m, with a slope of less than 1 in 15, although this will depend on
land availability, designated access and the type of maintenance equipment required for the pond. Side slopes to
the pond between the aquatic and safety bench should not usually exceed 1 in 3 for public safety reasons, and
wherever mowing is required, slopes should preferably be no steeper than 1 in 4. Where ponds are designed
to be created as hard landscape features within dense urban areas, acceptable slopes and depths should be
developed by the designer, giving full consideration to the management of health and safety (Chapter 36).
Vertical side slopes may be appropriate in such scenarios, provided depths are kept shallow, the system is well
integrated within the urban landscape and wildlife needs are fully taken into account.
Health and safety risk management design guidance is provided in Chapter 36.

SELECTION AND SITING OF PONDS OR WETLANDS
Ponds or wetlands are generally suitable for most types of new development and redevelopment, and
can be used in both residential and non-residential areas. Ponds are also appropriate for use in retrofit
situations where land is available at a suitable point near the outlet of the drainage system.
Through the effective use of upstream source control measures, SuDS ponds can usually be designed
as small features that blend unobtrusively into the landscape. Large bodies of open water need very
careful consideration. Ponds and wetlands can usually be integrated to the contours of a site fairly easily
and the potential variation in their design form and aesthetics means that they can complement and
enhance a wide range of urban settings. Ponds and wetlands should be placed in developments so they
are overlooked by housing and not hidden in an unseen corner. Alternatively, they can be located in larger
areas of open space. This ensures that the water features are a valued part of a development.
It may be difficult to site a pond on steeply sloping sites, and ponds should not be sited on unstable
ground. Ground stability should be verified by assessing site soil and groundwater conditions. Ponds
should not be built on waste-fill materials, uncontrolled fill or non-engineered fill. Where practical the pond
length should be oriented along the direction of prevailing summer winds to enhance wind mixing.
The soil below a wet pond should be sufficiently impermeable to maintain the water levels within the
permanent pool at the required level. In permeable strata, a liner (or other impermeable material such as
puddled clay) will be required to prevent the pond drying out. Evaluation of soils should be based on soils
investigations and permeability tests.
In areas containing contaminated soils or contaminated groundwater (brownfield sites), ponds can be
used, providing the system is fully sealed, preventing exchange of water between pond and groundwater.
Any excavation or earthmoving processes required should be assessed to ensure that mobilisation of
contamination does not occur.
490 Part D: Technical detail
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
If used on a site with a sensitive underlying groundwater one, or if used to treat runoff from a
potential pollution hotspot, a hydrogeological risk assessment will generally be required to determine
an appropriate separation distance between the bottom of the pond and the elevation of the annual
maximum water table unless a liner is proposed. If the subsurface soils are at all permeable, a liner (or
other impermeable material such as puddle clay) will be required to prevent leakage.
Where the groundwater table is close to the base of the pond, hydraulic connectivity between the water in
the pond and the groundwater should be prevented, unless the water quality requirements for infiltration
have been met (Chapter 4). Also, the operation of the outfall should be confirmed for the annual
maximum water table level. The maximum expected groundwater level should always be beneath the
temporary detention zone.
Ponds and wetlands are not appropriate management measures for runoff from construction sites or for
the construction period of the development, when sediment loadings are likely to be very high.
23.4 HYDRAULIC DESIGN
23.4.1 General
Guidance on hydraulic criteria and design standards is given in Chapter 3 and methods for sizing storage
are presented in Chapter 24. The pond/wetland temporary storage volume should be sied to provide
flood attenuation for all events to meet the site standards of service up to the 10, 0 or 100/200 year
events (including appropriate climate change and urban creep allowances), if required, with discharges
being constrained to the equivalent greenfield (or other agreed) rates. Consideration should be given
to larger events, as these should be safely routed downstream. Attenuation volumes may need to be
increased if additional storage is required to deliver adequate volumetric control of runoff for the 100 year
event (Section 23.4.4).
23.4.2 Interception design
Where infiltration is designed to occur when the water level rises above the level of the permanent pool,
then some contribution to Interception delivery (the prevention of runoff for small rainfall events) may
be achieved. The extent of any volumetric reduction achieved in this way is likely to be very limited and
requires careful assessment and design.
ea o ontro desin
Ponds or wetlands can help reduce flow rates from a site by controlling the discharge rate and allowing
the temporary storage volume to fill during storm events. The required peak flow control and storage
volume can be determined using standard hydraulic assessment (Chapter 24).
23.4.4 Volume control design
Ponds and wetlands do not normally contribute to volumetric control of runoff, but they can be used
to deliver further attenuation where Long-Term Storage is not practical (Chapter 3). Assessment of
volumetric control should follow the normal hydraulic assessment methods in Chapter 24.
eedane o desin
An exceedance flow route will be required for rainfall events that exceed the design capacity of the pond
or wetland and to convey flows should outlet blockages occur. This can be achieved by installing an
overflow pipe or weir/overflow/spillway structure above the design water storage level to convey excess
flows downstream. They should be designed to prevent over-topping of any embankment which might
cause structural damage, and spillways should be located so that downstream people and property are
not put at risk. For small ponds, a simple grass channel integrated into the landscape is usually suitable
as an exceedance route. A freeboard of 00 mm for the design event is usually sufficient for larger
Chapter 23: Ponds and wetlands
491
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
ponds, but where risks are particularly high a further allowance should be agreed with the environmental
regulator or other authority. Conversely, for smaller ponds, there may be no need for a freeboard,
provided the risk to people and property has been evaluated.
The exceedance flow capacity of the overflow should be confirmed using normal hydraulic assessment
methods and analyses (weir, orifice and pipe flow). Exceedance flow paths beyond the capacity of the
overflow should also be confirmed.
Any exceedance flow structure should be located as close to the inlet as possible to minimise the flow
path length for above-capacity flows (thus reducing the risk of scouring). See Section 23.8.2 on outlet
design for details. The overflow should not impede access to any inlet or outlet structure that manages
more frequent flows.
23.5 TREATMENT DESIGN
Ponds and wetlands will not provide a significant reduction in contaminant load via volumetric runoff
control, as they generally do not provide Interception (Section 23.4.2).
Ponds and wetlands treat incoming runoff through settling and biological uptake. The primary pollutant
removal mechanism is the settling of silts and suspended sediments. Uptake of pollutants, particularly
nutrients, also occurs to some degree through the biological activity of the pond. Emergent and
submerged aquatic vegetation along the shoreline support an active microbial community capable of
consuming dissolved constituents in the inflow. Pond inflows from most runoff events replace a portion of
the prior volume and are stored and treated until displaced by the perennial baseflow or next runoff event.
The primary design factor that determines a pond’s treatment efficiency is the volume of the permanent
pool. Research findings from Lampe et al (2003) suggests that permanent pond sizes > 2 × the mean
annual storm volume do not significantly enhance treatment performance or reduce outfall concentration
variability. This equates a treatment volume of 10–15 mm of rainfall depth falling over the contributing
catchment, or around 1–1.5 times the Vt formula defined for Scotland as shown in Equation 23.1.

Where ponds are implemented as final polishing elements downstream of components that deliver both
sediment removal and further treatment (eg permeable pavements, swales or bioretention systems), then
smaller sies may be acceptable, depending on the effectiveness of the upstream SuDS components.
Larger ponds should not be considered as providing enhanced treatment capacity, and ponds should
not accept contaminated runoff directly, as this will cause failure in delivering amenity and biodiversity
performance and will increase maintenance risks and costs.
In general, wet pond facilities function best when surface water entering the pond moves through the
pond as a single wave or unit, fully displacing the wet pond volume – a phenomena known as plug
flow. By preventing short-circuiting occurring, this flow pattern maximises the hydraulic retention time,
which enhances particulate and particle-bound sediment settlement – a key process in pond treatment
492 Part D: Technical detail
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
effectiveness. Water quality event storage can be provided in multiple cells. Treatment performance is
enhanced when multiple treatment pathways are provided using multiple cells, longer flowpaths, higher
surface area-to-volume ratios and complex microtopography.
Evidence of the pollutant removal efficiencies of ponds and wetlands is presented in Chapter 26, Annex 3.
For proper functioning and to prevent sediment and associated pollutants from eroding and flushing
out of ponds during storms, it is important that the permanent pond is retained. This may mean that an
impermeable liner is required to prevent leakage from the pond.
If ponds have to be 1.5 m in depth, it is recommended that some form of recirculation be provided in
the summer, such as a fountain or aerator, to prevent stagnation and low dissolved oxygen conditions.
A small amount of base flow may be desirable to maintain circulation and reduce the potential for low
oxygen conditions during late summer.
Trees along the west and south sides of ponds (not on embankments) can be used to reduce the
risk of thermal heating, particularly in dense urban areas where urban heat island effects may drive
temperatures particularly high during summer months. As well as giving shade, trees and shrubs also
discourage waterfowl use and the attendant phosphorous enrichment problems they cause. Trees should
be set back so that the branches will not extend over the pond.
23.6 AMENITY DESIGN
Pond and wetland design should add value to the amenity of the local communities and be of an
appropriate scale and form to suit the surrounding landscape character. In green open spaces, it is likely
that they would have a natural appearance with soft edges and forms that blend with the surrounding
area. In dense urban environments, hard straight edges may be more suitable, provided that wildlife
access is considered.
The extent to which the pond is designed as an amenity feature will depend on the likely level of contamination
of the inflows. Where it is being used as a final polishing component, amenity potential will be high.
Ponds can provide an educational resource for local schools and community environment groups and be
the focal point of a recreational area (Figures 23.9 and 23.10).
Figure 23.9 Pond dipping platform, Matchborough First
School, Worcestershire (courtesy Robert Bray Associates)
Figure 23.10 Urban pond, Western Harbour, Malmö,
Sweden (courtesy Essex County Council)
Pond design should be undertaken with appropriate inputs from engineers, hydrologists, ecologists and
landscape architects. Designs should take account of the local landscape character and environment and
community requirements (Chapter 34), as well as the biodiversity objectives for the site.
Chapter 23: Ponds and wetlands
493
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
High fencing tends to isolate pond systems, reduces amenity benefits and potentially increases health
and safety risks. Toddler-proof fencing, if thought necessary, combined with effective planting and
landscaping can be used to manage public access points and facilitate the movement of wildlife.
Pedestrian access to shallow pool areas that are enhanced with emergent wetland vegetation can
allow the pond to be more accessible without incurring safety risks. If fences are deemed necessary,
consideration should be given to checking the suitability of a pond at the site. If fences have to be
used, it is better to set them well back from the edge of the pond so that they do not reinforce negative
perceptions of water in the environment.
Picnic tables or seating for local residents or visitors can be installed on flat areas overlooking or
adjoining the pond, and walking or jogging trails around the pond are also often easily integrated into
site design. Visual aesthetics can often be enhanced with clusters of trees and shrubs rather than using
individual plants. Trees should be set back from the water’s edge so that branches do not extend over the
pond (to prevent leaf drop into the water and too much shading).
Children should not be able to gain access to spillways, and all vertical drops exceeding 1.2 m (eg
headwalls above pipe inlets/outfalls) should be avoided (or if necessary fenced). Wherever possible,
vertical drops should be avoided or graded to shallow slopes unless health and safety risk assessment
confirms their acceptability.
For large ponds, consideration should be given to whether fishing in the water is appropriate and, if not,
warning signs should be considered. Life-saving equipment or signs highlighting the risks associated with
entering the water should only be provided where required by the risk assessment, and operators will
have to inspect any signage or equipment on a regular basis to minimise any liability risks.
Health and safety risk management principles are presented in Chapter 36.
Interpretation boards can be provided to inform the public of the function of the pond, and also to provide
information on the local flora and fauna that the system supports.
Chapter 34 discusses public education and awareness-raising strategies.
23.7 BIODIVERSITY DESIGN
Wherever possible, ponds and wetlands should be located
in, or adjacent to, non-intensively managed landscapes
where natural sources of native species are likely to be
good and/or should aim to provide connectivity to other
ecological networks. Surrounding habitat should provide a
variety of both covered and open approaches to the water
which are favoured by differing species.
Ponds should have varying depths (which will provide a
range of different habitats) and should, where appropriate,
include deep (1 m) over-wintering areas as refuges for
wildlife during severe winters. The development of mosaics
of marginal plants should be encouraged (rather than
single-species stands) to maximise habitat structural
diversity. The development of open and lightly shaded
areas or pools should also be encouraged, as this will add
to the diversity of habitats available.
Wherever possible, ponds or wetlands should be located
away from artificial light sources, as this will reduce the
value of the feature to foraging bats. Similarly, new lighting
features should be avoided in close proximity to ponds.

CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Ponds and wetlands should be designed to prevent/discourage the introduction of species such as fish
and wildfowl, where an objective of the system is to support amphibians, particularly great crested newts.
If the pond discharges to a nutrient sensitive receptor, dense planting can be considered on the side
slopes to discourage wildfowl use. Conversely, where wildfowl use is to be encouraged, “bays” suitable
for breeding birds can be integrated into the shape of larger ponds and breeding “islands” should be no
closer than 3 m from the edge of the pond to prevent access by foxes.
Pond designs can be improved for ecology by developing the pond system in two phases Phase 1
establishes the basic shape and structure of the pond with a follow-up Phase 2 (1–2 years later) to
undertake fine-tuning of the scheme. Examples of small-scale refinement that can be incorporated in
Phase 2 and that add considerably to the habitat value of sites include
addition of small-scale topographic features (eg reprofiling of pond margins to increase the extent of
seasonal water level variations
maximising the potential of unplanned habitats that occur on most sites, such as runoff from grassed
slopes and natural seepages.
Ecological value can be further enhanced by creating small pools around the margins of larger ponds,
which are fed by clean surface runoff from non-intensively managed grassland, scrub or woodland on
the basin sides. These pools should be located above the level of the main SuDS pond. If some ponds,
or parts of basins, are not exposed to the main pollutant burden, this may allow a wider range of animals
and plants to exploit some parts of the site. As well as enhancing biodiversity, such a design approach
should ensure rapid re-colonisation following any potential spill event. This type of benefit may also be
achieved through the use of multiple ponds in series, where water quality improves through the train.
In contaminated systems, shallow water and wetland areas can support a range of wildlife that is
less vulnerable to the effects of pollutants than submerged aquatic plants and those animals that live
permanently under the water (such as mayfly larvae, dragonfly larvae and fish). Further information on
maximising the ecological benefits of SuDS is given in Biggs (200) and Graham et al (2013).
23.8 PHYSICAL SPECIFICATIONS
23.8.1 Pre-treatment and inlets
The number of inlets to the feature should be limited, preferably to one. The flowpath length should be
maximised from inlet to outlet for all inlets.
Effective pre-treatment for all inlets should ideally be implemented via appropriate source control and
upstream SuDS Management Train components (Chapter 4). As many contaminants adhere to sediment,
its removal will ensure that the water in the main pool is relatively clean and can deliver on amenity and
biodiversity objectives. Where there are residual sediment risks, or where a sediment forebay is the
only suitable management option at the site, then the pond/wetland area can be split to allow heavier
sediments to drop out of suspension before the runoff enters the main body of the system. The sediment
forebay allows sediment build-up to be easily monitored, and concentrates any required sediment
removal activities within a small area, thereby minimising potential damage to the rest of the pond or
wetland. The plan area of the sedimentation bay should be at least 10% of the total basin area and
could consist of a separate basin or be formed by building an earth berm, stone- or rock-filled gabion or
rip-rap across the upstream portion of the basin. For systems with multiple inlets, pre-treatment should
be provided for each inlet that is likely to contribute a significant sediment load. Each forebay should be
accessible and easily maintained.
Consideration should be given to installing a fixed sediment depth marker in forebays where high
sediment loads are expected, to measure sediment deposition with time. This will assist with the
development of appropriate future maintenance schedules. The base of the forebay can be reinforced to
facilitate sediment removal. If a membrane liner is used without protection, great care should be taken
during sediment removal operations.
Chapter 23: Ponds and wetlands
495
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
The energy of the incoming flows should be dissipated to minimise the risk of scouring and erosion, and
to prevent disturbance to the permanent pool volume. This can be achieved by stabilising inflow channels
using rip-rap or other erosion control systems, or by partially or fully submerging the inlet pipe. The scale of
the erosion mitigation system should be physically and aesthetically proportionate to the size of the pond.
Figure 23.12 Illman Young)
Energy dissipating inlet channels for ponds, Augustenborg, Sweden (courtesy Graham Fairhurst and
Safety grilles may be required if inlet pipe diameters allow public entry, but they tend to increase the risks
of blockage and can present a hazard in themselves so, wherever possible, inlet infrastructure should be
designed so that they are not required.
If the pond or wetland is to be constructed off-line, as a treatment facility only, then an upstream bypass
structure can be used to divert events that require treatment into the pond/wetland. Flows exceeding
this will then bypass the system, reducing the potential for turbulence and mixing, and allowing optimum
contaminant removal processes to occur.
Guidance on inlet design is set out in Chapter 28.
23.8.2 Outlets
At the outlet, there will normally be a requirement for some form of flow control system. A manhole-
type outlet structure can accommodate a variety of outlet control mechanisms. Ponds and wetlands
will generally require a non-clogging, variable flow rate control structure at the outlet, together with an
emergency overflow. Low flow controls are generally provided via protected orifices, which can then be
combined with overflow channels and overflow weir sections and/or culverts for larger events. Multiple
orifices or pipe outlets can be used to achieve the same objectives. Trash screens are not recommended,
but where they are considered necessary to prevent access into pipework, they should be designed so
that debris does not unduly obstruct or reduce design flow rates.
The design of exceedance flow management components is discussed in Section 23.4.5.
The outlet area should be the deepest point to provide final settling and to prevent resuspension of
sediments. Energy dissipation may be required downstream of the outlet to prevent scouring and erosion
but this will depend on the outflow discharge rates, the outfall design and the vulnerability of the
receiving watercourse or lake to erosion.
496 Part D: Technical detail
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
For outlet pipes through embankments, seepage control in the form of collars may need to be provided.
Guidance on outlet design is set out in Chapter 28.
23.9 MATERIALS
23.9.1 Pond/wetland liners
Pond liners can be formed from a range of different materials. The requirements for benching should
always be considered, to ensure that layers of saturated subsoil do not slip off the liner, otherwise soil
containment systems can be used. Geosynthetic clay liners (Figure 23.13) tend to be less prone to
stability issues because the material is a sandwich of bentonite between two geotextiles, but the stability
of overlying soil layers should still be a consideration.
Geomembrane liners (butyl is a common form) should normally be protected with geotextile fleece layers
(Figure 23.14). Clay liners should be protected from drying out (Figure 23.15). The thickness of clay
required to ensure complete impermeability should be at least 500 mm, and preferably 1 m. The minimum
permeability of the compacted clay should be 1 × 109 m/s.
Appropriate specifications for geomembranes are presented in Section 30.5.

mbanment fi materia
If an embankment is required to impound the water, the embankment fill material should use inert natural
soils that will not leach contaminants into the stored runoff. Embankments should be designed to be stable
and watertight, and the detailed guidance contained within Kennard et al (1996) should be followed.
23.9.3 Subsoil and topsoil
Appropriate specifications for subsoils and topsoils are presented in Section 30.4.
23.10 LANDSCAPE DESIGN AND PLANTING
In green open space and natural landscaped
areas, ponds should be developed to mimic
natural forms, using soft geometries with curved
boundaries and undulating margins. In hard
landscaped, urban areas, a more functional and
linear structure may be appropriate.
Vegetation can enhance the appearance of the
pond, stabilise side slopes and prevent erosion,
serve as wildlife habitat and temporarily
conceal unsightly litter and debris. Aquatic
vegetation provides some nutrient uptake,
stabilises the sediments in the base of the
facility (thus preventing scour and resuspension
during heavy storms) and increases sediment
settling effectiveness by slowing the flows
Figure 23.16 Geometric design of pond in an urban area,
Malm, Sweden (courtesy Illman Young)
across the pond. A vegetated aquatic bench
can help prevent children from entering open-water areas and discourage the use of adjacent grassed
areas by geese. Plants should therefore be encouraged along the aquatic bench, the safety bench and
side slopes and within shallow areas of the pool itself. Some areas should be left open for wildlife access
and to allow clear sightlines favoured by certain species.
Where possible, wetland plants should be encouraged in pond design, either along the aquatic bench
(fringe wetlands), the safety bench and side slopes (emergent wetlands) or within shallow areas of the
pond itself. The best elevations for establishing wetland plants, either through transplantation or volunteer
colonisation, are within 150 mm of the normal pool. Tall, emergent species should be planted on aquatic
benches, although the selection of species should also consider the risks of children not being observed
498 Part D: Technical detail
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
if they get into difficulties due to being hidden by vegetation. The plants should not restrict visibility of
the water’s edge or hinder adult supervision, particularly in amenity areas. Dense planting of marginal
floating-leaved and aquatic plants should be avoided, and the wetland should be left to colonise as
naturally as possible. Over-planting initially will tend to fill space that could otherwise be exploited by self-
colonising local species, and so reduces the potential ecological value of the wetland. A diversity of plants
is very valuable ecologically, and monocultures of, for example, reeds should be avoided. Wetland plants
should be tolerant of fluctuating water levels. Ideal species are those that offer a high density of stems in
the submerged zone, maximising the contact between water and the surface on which microorganisms
grow, while providing uniform flow conditions.
Designers should develop an appropriate plant list (usually comprising species found within 0 km of the
development site), which may vary, depending on the design and landscape objectives for the scheme.
Non-native species are more likely to be appropriate in more formal or urban settings, but may also be
beneficial in enhancing pollinators and in providing aesthetic value. Particular care should be taken not to
introduce invasive species to the pond or wetland system, and all plant supplies should be accredited or
plant sources known. Were appropriate, the species mix should aim to create habitats that contribute to
local, regional and national biodiversity strategies (Chapter 29).
Wetland planting density varies but is typically 4–8 plants per m2. Wetland planting should take place
between early April and mid June so that the plants have a full growing season to develop the root
reserves they need to survive the winter. Vegetation usually needs to be quickly established once surface
water flows are introduced to the system, in order to ensure pollutant removal levels and to reduce the
risk of bankside erosion. Some ponds at the end of a drainage system may lend themselves to natural
colonisation, particularly if linking to existing wetlands or watercourses. The slow colonisation of these
ponds can provide valuable successional habitats. However, erosion during establishment of the
vegetation needs to be carefully considered.
The soils of a pond buffer are often severely compacted during the construction process. The density
of these compacted soils is so great that it effectively prevents root penetration, and therefore may lead
to premature mortality or loss of vigour. Consequently, it is advisable to excavate large and deep holes
around the proposed planting sites, and then backfill these with uncompacted topsoil. Where ponds and
wetlands have been excavated to subsoils that lack the nutrients and organic matter to support quality
growth, topsoil or wetland mulch should be added to all planting areas – taking account of the need
to control ongoing nutrient loadings to the water body. A soil depth of 150 mm is usually adequate for
grassed areas, but up to 450 mm may be required to support large shrubs.

23.11 CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS
The bottom and side slopes of the pond, including any benches, should be carefully prepared to ensure
that they are structurally sound. Any embankments should be checked to ensure that they meet their
design criteria. The preparation should also ensure that the basin will satisfactorily retain the surface
water runoff without significant erosion damage.
Backfilling against inlet and outlet structures needs to be controlled so as to minimise settlement and
erosion. The soils used to finish the side slopes of the pond above the retained level need to be suitably
fertile, porous and of sufficient depth to ensure healthy vegetation growth. If an impermeable liner is used,
care should be taken to ensure that it is not damaged during construction.
There are various materials available to help prevent erosion while allowing plants to establish (Section
29.4.3). Ideally, planting would be planned over a number of years so that the rate of establishment can
be monitored and densities adjusted accordingly.
Ponds can only be used to manage construction runoff where there is provision made for their complete
rehabilitation to original design formation levels before handover. Planting schemes should be delayed
until full rehabilitation has been undertaken.
Further detail on construction activities and the programming of construction activities is provided in
Chapter 31. Generic health and safety guidance is provided in Chapter 36. A construction phase health
and safety plan is required under CDM 2015. This should ensure that all construction risks have been

23.12 OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS
Ponds and wetlands will require regular maintenance to ensure continuing operation to design
performance standards, and all designers should provide detailed specifications and frequencies for
the required maintenance activities, along with likely machinery requirements and typical annual costs
– within the Maintenance Plan. The treatment performance of ponds and wetlands is dependent on
maintenance, and robust management plans will be required to ensure maintenance is carried out in the
long term. Different designs will have different operation and maintenance requirements, but this section
gives some generic guidance.
Maintenance of ponds is relatively straightforward for landscape contractors, and typically there should
only be a small amount of extra work required for a SuDS pond or wetland feature over and above what is
necessary for standard public open space.
Regular inspection and maintenance is important for the effective operation of ponds as designed.
Maintenance responsibility for a pond and its surrounding area should always be placed with a responsible
organisation. Litter and debris removal should be undertaken as part of general landscape maintenance for
the site and before any other SuDS management task. All litter should be removed from site.
Any invasive maintenance work such as silt or vegetation removal is only required intermittently, but it
should be planned to be sympathetic to the requirements of wildlife in a pond. Care should be taken to avoid
disturbance to nesting birds during the breeding season and habitats of target species (eg great crested
newt and water voles) at critical times. The window for carrying out maintenance to achieve this is usually
towards the end of the growing season (typically September/October), although this will vary with species).
Invasive silt and vegetation removal should only be carried out to limited areas at any one time (250
of the pond area on one occasion each year to minimise the impact on biodiversity. Plant management, to
achieve particular desired habitat effects, should be clearly specified in a maintenance schedule.
Site vegetation should be trimmed as necessary to keep the pond free of leaves and to maintain the
aesthetic appearance of the site. Slope areas that have become bare should be re-vegetated and any
eroded areas should be regraded before replanting.
500 Part D: Technical detail
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Maintenance access (or “easement”) should be provided to the pond from a public or private road. An
assessment should be made at the planning stage regarding the maintenance and associated access
requirements. Ideally, access should be at least .5 m wide, have a maximum cross fall of 1 in 7, and be
sufficiently robust to withstand maintenance equipment and vehicles. However, temporary access routes
for infrequent operations could be considered where permanent routes are not appropriate. The access
should extend to any forebay, safety and aquatic benches, inlet and outlet infrastructure. Consideration
should be given as to whether maintenance vehicles will need to turn around. Wherever possible
SuDS ponds and wetlands should be designed so that special machinery is not required to undertake
maintenance.
Table 23.1 provides guidance on the type of operational and maintenance requirements that may
be appropriate. The list of actions is not exhaustive and some actions may not always be required.
Consideration should be given to the need to control risks to biosecurity during maintenance operations
and guidance is provided in Chapter 29.
Sediments excavated from ponds or forebays that receive runoff from residential or standard road and
roof areas should be safely disposed of in accordance with current waste management legislation.
However, consultation should take place with the environmental regulator to confirm appropriate
protocols. Chemical testing of the sediment may be required, before sediment excavation, to determine
its classification and appropriate disposal methods. For industrial site runoff, sediment testing will be
essential. In the majority of cases on low-risk sites with source control and a Management Train, it will be
acceptable to distribute the sediment on site, if there is an appropriate safe and acceptable location to do
so. Further detail on waste management is provided in Chapter 33. If ponds are to be drawn down, care
should be taken to prevent downstream discharge of sediments and anoxic water. The environmental
regulator should be notified before such activities.
New ponds may become rapidly dominated by invasive native plants, particularly common bulrush (Typha
latifolia). As it is not desirable for all new ponds to be bulrush dominated, it should be ensured that in
the first five years, while vegetation is establishing, certain plant growth is controlled. After this time,
ponds can usually be allowed to develop naturally recognising that, unless the margins are occasionally
managed, they are likely to become dominated by trees and shrubs.
Eutrophication of SuDS ponds can occur during the summer months. This is best alleviated by controlling
the nutrient source or providing a continuous baseflow to the pond. Unless eutrophication is severe,
aeration can be used as a stop-gap measure to save aquatic animal species and reduce risks to receiving
waters. However, the addition of barley straw bales, dredging or rendering the nutrients inactive by
chemical means can also be successful.
Maintenance Plans and schedules should be developed during the design phase. Specific maintenance
needs of the pond should be monitored, and maintenance schedules adjusted to suit requirements. Further
detail on the preparation of maintenance specifications and schedules of work is given in Chapter 32.
Generic health and safety guidance is provided in Chapter 36. CDM 2015 requires designers to ensure
that all maintenance risks have been identified, eliminated, reduced and/or controlled where appropriate.
This information will be required as part of the health and safety file.

24.1 INTRODUCTION
The preliminary calculations required to design a SuDS scheme to meet the hydraulic
design criteria are:
1 for reenfiel an reiously eeloe sites an estimate of the peak runoff
rates and runoff volumes from the site in its greenfield state
2 for previously developed sites: an estimate of the peak runoff rates and volumes
from the site in its previously developed state
These runoff rates will dictate the rate to which the runoff from the site should be
controlled (as required by water quantity standard 2) and the calculation methods
are set out in Sections 24.3 and 24.5.
These runoff volumes will dictate the allowable volume of runoff that can be
discharged from the site (as required by water quantity standard 1) and the
calculation methods are set out in Sections 24.4 and 24.5.
for the proposed development: an estimate of the runoff rates and volumes
from the site in its developed state (Section 24.6 for calculation methods), and
how these should be adjusted to take account of potential future development and
climate change (Section 24.7).
The runoff rates calculated for the proposed development will exceed the allowable
discharge rates. Therefore, the SuDS design will need to include attenuation storage
that will fill during rainfall events and/or infiltration components that mean that runoff
does not occur. Calculation methods for attenuation storage are set out in Section 24.9.
The volume of runoff from the proposed development will also exceed the allowable
discharge volumes. Therefore, the SuDS design will need to “use” the runoff
(Chapter 11), infiltrate the runoff (Chapter 25) and/or store and tightly control an
additional storage volume, referred to as Long-Term Storage (Section 24.10).
Chapter 24: Hydrology and hydraulics
507
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Where runoff volumes before development are low, this reflects the presence of more permeable soils.
Therefore, although the estimated runoff volumes for the proposed development will be significantly
greater, it should be possible to infiltrate a large proportion of this volume, provided that the groundwater
is adequately protected (Section 26.3).
Designing the site to deliver adequate Interception (the prevention of runoff from the site for the majority
of small rainfall events), as required by water quantity standard 1, is set out in Section 24.8.
Section 24.11 describes how to design drainage components that convey flow from one point on
the site to another, up to a specified standard of service
Section 24.12 describes design methods for managing flows greater than this standard (ie
designing for exceedance flow management).
24.2 RUNOFF ESTIMATION METHODS
24.2.1 An overview of available methods
There are several methods that can be used for estimating peak runoff rates and runoff volumes.
Catchment runoff models, adjusted for the sie of the site, tend to be used for predicting runoff from
greenfield sites. When predicting the response of a developed site, models that represent the existing or
proposed drainage system are required, taking account of conveyance and storage capacities of drainage
components, flow controls and areas likely to flood and store water during extreme events.
The available methods are summarised in Table 24.1 and described in the sections in this chapter as
indicated. Drainage approving bodies may specify the methods that they require to be used for drainage
submissions, or they may leave method selection to the designer. The required approach should always
be checked at an early stage in the design process.
Some of these methods are old and there are more recent methods likely to produce better runoff
estimates. However, these older methods tend to be simpler and are not dependent on software that has
to be purchased. Where the expertise and software required to design and approve systems using the
more recent methods is available, the newer methods should be used. Different methods are likely to give
different runoff estimates, which could influence the storage volumes required for the drainage system
and thus the scheme cost and viability.
24.2.2 Runoff areas to be used in calculations
The runoff area used in any of the runoff estimation methods should be consistent for example, if the whole
site area is used in the greenfield runoff rate calculations, the whole site should also be represented in the
runoff calculations for the proposed development. If there is a landscaped area in the developed scenario
that discharges directly to receiving waters and does not contribute to the drainage system (so is excluded
from the calculations) then this area should also be excluded from the greenfield calculations.
24.2.3 Rainfall to be used in calculations
In order for assessments to be made of the likely rate and volume of runoff from a developed site or
catchment, a depth of rainfall and/or rainfall profile is required. This is also required for assessment of
greenfield rates if a rainfallrunoff modelling approach is adopted. To date, design rainfall event methods
have normally been used that are based on the use of fixed rainfall depths for different return period
events and standard rainfall profiles (eg the FEH depth-duration-frequency rainfall model CEH, 1999).
The alternative approach, which is becoming more common for some applications, is to use a continuous
time series of rainfall to generate a time series of flows from which frequency curves can be generated.
These rainfall time series can come from observed rainfall data, if the series is long enough and
appropriately quality assured and calibrated, or can be statistically generated from a number of observed
datasets. The two approaches are described in the following sections.

Notes
1 The Environment Agency (through the joint EA/Defra/NRW/Welsh Government FCERM research and development programme)
is currently undertaking research that will improve small catchment and plot-scale flood and hydrograph estimation. The intention
is for the research and new methods to be available to practitioners in 2017. Some interim outputs are already available (Faulkner
et al, 2012).
The research is investigating three approaches:
a full hydrological analysis method for watercourses (using FEH software and catchment descriptors)
a rapid assessment method for watercourses (using FEH catchment descriptors)
a specific plot-scale method with a free-to-access tool and input characteristic data
SuDS practitioners undertaking hydrological analysis from 2017 onwards should check for the latest guidance and
recommendations on the Environment Agency R&D web pages or the FEH development pages (hosted on the CEH website).
2 FEH methods are preferred.
Simple method, relevant for initial design estimates and very simple sites.
No longer recommended, but included here as it is still used in current modelling software packages.
Design rainfall
The standard approach currently used by drainage engineers is to use design rainfall events with specific
return periods and durations. These were developed originally in the Flood Studies Report (FSR) (NERC,
1975) and have been developed further in the Flood Estimation Handbook (FEH) (CEH, 1999), and
subsequent revisions (Stewart et al, 201). They are routinely used as inputs to greenfield runoff and
development drainage models from which flow hydrographs and drainage system performance assessments
are then produced.
The FSR/FEH methods provide two profiles a summer (peakier, with higher intensities) profile and a
winter (flatter, with lower intensities) profile. EA/Defra research into rainfall frequency found that seasonal
adjustments were applicable to all durations (Stewart et al, 201). Osborne (2012) suggests that, for
shorter duration events, winter events should have a smaller total depth.
Summer profiles usually give the worst-case scenarios for siing piped systems or components receiving
direct runoff from impermeable surfaces. Winter profiles generally give the worst case when siing
storage and downstream attenuation components. This is because of the increased runoff generated
for winter events due to higher catchment wetness parameter values, which result in larger storage
requirements. Although the FEH can be used for durations as short as 0 minutes, flood estimation
guidance from the EA (2015) currently recommends that, for shorter durations, FSR rainfall statistics
should be used to scale down the corresponding FEH 1-hour rainfall.
The critical duration is the length of rainfall event that results in the greatest flow rate, flood volume or
flood level (depending on the purpose of the analysis) at a particular location. It is common for the critical
Chapter 24: Hydrology and hydraulics
509
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
duration to be different at different points in the drainage system, with different SuDS components having
different critical durations. This results in a site designer having to use a matrix of events of different
return periods and durations to ensure that the design criteria for the system are met at all points. Return
periods from 11 year to 1100 years (or 1200 years in Scotland) and durations from 15 minutes to
hours are often required to be assessed.
For greenfield sites, the event duration is not always required, as the estimation of the peak rate of runoff
can be based on correlation equations that do not use event rainfall data as an input. However, there are
some greenfield runoff models that generate a flow hydrograph from rainfall and, for these, the design
event duration is estimated by the models.
Time series rainfall
Continuous rainfall data is a time series of observed (where available) or statistically generated rainfall
depths (where observed records are unavailable or too short for the required application). Time
series rainfall is not yet routinely used in the design of surface water management systems, due to
its inconsistent availability, cost and processing demands. However, in the case of SuDS, time series
rainfall allows more accurate estimates of runoff, taking account of infiltration, soil moisture storage and
release and evapotranspiration processes. It also allows estimates of subannual event frequencies and
associated durations and velocities, which is useful for the assessment of treatment effectiveness.
The length of the rainfall series should be long enough to ensure that the complexity of rainfall
characteristics and related aspects, such as dry periods, are properly taken into account. A minimum series
length of at least twice, and preferably three times, the design return period of the system is recommended.
24.3 GREENFIELD SITES: PEAK RUNOFF RATE ESTIMATION
Estimated peak runoff rates for the development site in its greenfield condition for a range of return
periods are normally used to define the discharge limits for a new development site.
For greenfield sites, the peak runoff rate for any particular return period is related to the site’s
catchment characteristics (including soils). The values derived from any analysis should be regarded
as approximate, because prediction of runoff from very small catchments will always be imprecise.
Furthermore, all runoff estimation methods have been developed using river flow information from much
larger catchments than the average development site. However, it has been demonstrated in recent
research that there is little evidence that the FEH methods perform less well at smaller scales (Faulkner
et al, 2012). It should be understood that the overall objective of using an agreed method is to provide
a consistent and reasonable estimate upon which storage design can be based, rather than finding the
exact runoff rate for any specific site (which is not possible).
The current approaches recommended for calculating greenfield runoff rates are described in the
following sections. However, the method used at a particular site should always be agreed with the
drainage approval body. Further guidance is provided in EA (2015) and Faulkner et al (2012).
FEH methods should be the preferred approach for developing runoff estimates for use in surface water
management design, but their use currently depends on access to the FEH documentation and software
and suitable hydrological modelling expertise. Where FEH tools are not available, and with agreement
of the approving body, the Marshall and Bayliss (199) approach can be used as an alternative method.
From 2017, new recommendations for estimating greenfield runoff rates and volumes will be published
(see Note (1) for Table 24.1).
It should be noted that Marshall and Bayliss (199) is more likely to underestimate runoff rates than FEH
methods, potentially leading to overdesign of attenuation storage components (Faulkner et al, 2012).

CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
24.3.1 Flood Estimation Handbook (FEH)
The FEH methods of flood estimation (CEH, 1999), together with subsequent revisions, superseded the
FSR (NERC, 1975) as standard practice for catchment rainfall and runoff analysis in the UK in 1999. Two
main approaches for flood frequency estimation are provided
statistical method
rainfall-runoff method (ReFH2)
These are described in the following sections.
FEH statistical method
The FEH statistical method allows estimation of the complete flood frequency curve in any gauged or
ungauged catchment in the UK. Details of the updated method can be found in Kjeldsen et al (200), and
only a brief summary is presented here.
EQ.
24.1
stimatin the o freuen ure usin the statistia method
The peak rate of runoff for any return period is determined by multiplying an index flood by a return
period factor. For example, for the 1100 year peak runoff rate, this is
where:
Q100 100 year peak runoff rate
Qmed index flood
GC100 100 year growth curve factor
The index flood can either be computed from relevant observed flows, or can be estimated using an equation
where it is related to a number of hydrological parameters termed catchment descriptors, which are digitally
mapped for the UK (and provided as part of the FEH software). On the FEH CD-ROM catchment descriptor
map, average values are provided for the catchment area associated with each defined point along a
watercourse. It is not, therefore, possible to determine the relevant descriptors for a specific development
site using the current software. The CD-ROM is to be replaced by a web-based delivery service in
autumn 2015, and it is planned that future updates will provide some catchment descriptors relevant to
individual points or small areas.
For catchments or sites smaller than 50 ha (0.5 km2), it is suggested that runoff estimates should be made
using the methods applied to the nearest suitable catchment above this threshold for which descriptors can
be extracted, and then the rates are scaled down by the ratio of catchment area to plot sie (Faulkner et al,
2012). The decision to translate FEH estimates from catchment scale to plot scale should be accompanied
by an assessment of whether the study site is sufficiently representative of the surrounding catchment area.
In particular, checks should always be made of the HOST soil class suggested by FEH, by inspection on site.
Alternatively, if the FEH software is not used, then an agreed site-specific set of parameters can be used.
The flood frequency (flows for different return period events) estimation procedure therefore consists of
three stages:
1 stimate te ine oo (defined as the median annual maximum flood, Qmed), either from
observed annual peak flow data or from catchment descriptors. The catchment descriptor equation is
given in Equation 24.2. The Qmed estimate can be improved where flows are available from nearby,
similar gauged catchments using methods published by Kjeldsen (201).
2 Derive an appropriate growth curve. At a gauged site, flood frequency analysis techniques are
applied to either gauged annual maximum and/or peaks-over-threshold flood peak data where
available. At an ungauged site, the FEH pooling-group software package, WINFAP, is used to create

511

a pooling-group of hydrologically similar gauged catchments (ie catchments showing similarity
with regard to key catchment descriptors catchment area (AREA), standard annual average rainfall
(SAAR), flood attenuation from reservoirs and lakes (FARL) and floodplain extent (FPEXT)). Flood
growth curves are then created through analysis of the pooling-group flood peak data.

FARL a measurement of the attenuation influence of water bodies (eg lakes) in the

measure is provided within the FEH software or, if a suitable site soil assessment
is available, then IH126 Table 2.12 (Boorman et al, 1995) can be used to allocate
a HOST category to the site soils, and IH126 Table 3.4 can then be used to obtain
a corresponding value for BFIHOST.
Revitalised FSR/FEH rainfall-runoff method (ReFH2)
The revitalised FSR/FEH rainfall-runoff method (ReFH) was developed as an event-based approach to
design flood estimation and replaced the previous FSR method. Details of the method can be found in
Kjeldsen (2007) and subsequent updates (CEH and WHS, 2015). The current version of the method,
ReFH2, also includes a component for incorporating the influence of the runoff from paved surfaces on
runoff rates and volumes described by Kjeldsen et al (201) (Section 24.5). Only a brief summary is
presented here. The method uses an event-based rainfall-runoff model, to convert design storm events of
appropriate duration and return period into a corresponding design flood event of similar return period. As
this method produces runoff hydrographs, it will provide an estimate of greenfield runoff volumes as well
estimates of the peak flow rate.
The ReFH model has four model parameters controlling the following
hydrological losses (maximum soil capacity, Cmax)
routing using a unit hydrograph (time to peak, Tp)
baseflow recharge (BR)
baseflow lag-time (BL)
and two initial conditions:
initial depth of water held in the soil (Cini)
initial baseflow at the start of an event (BF0)
The four parameters and two initial conditions are estimated using catchment descriptors available from
the FEH CD-ROM software. The design storms are generated using the FEH rainfall depth-duration-
frequency (DDF) model (Faulkner, 1999), also included within the ReFH2 software package.
512 Part E: Supporting guidance
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
For catchments smaller than 50 ha (0.5 km2) and small plots of land, it is currently recommended that
the model is applied to the nearest suitable catchment above this threshold for which descriptors can be
derived, and then the hydrographs are scaled down by the ratio of catchment area to plot sie (Faulkner
et al, 2012). Alternatively, the new ReFH2 software package also includes parameter equations for plot-
scale application.
As with the statistical method, the decision to translate FEH estimates from catchment scale to plot scale
should be accompanied by an assessment of whether the study site is sufficiently representative of the
surrounding catchment area. In particular, checks should always be made of the soil class suggested by
FEH, by inspection on site.
The original ReFH1 method is not recommended for use to predict the response of greenfield catchments
defined as permeable (BFIHOST 0.65), because it is likely to underpredict the catchment response.
Through revised initial conditions, the ReFH2 method has addressed this limitation (CEH and WHS, 2015)
24.3.2 Flood estimation for small catchments (IH124)
The Marshall and Bayliss (199) approach was the result of a study aimed at improving the
characterisation of flood response on small catchments (for areas less than 25 km2), especially on
relatively permeable, dry, partly urbanised catchments. They presented new equations for time to peak
based on FSR catchment characteristics for both part-urban and rural catchments. The study also
introduced a revised version of the FSR regression equation for the mean annual flood (QBAR), based on
gauged records for 71 small rural catchments. However, unlike the catchments used in the same study for
the investigation of flood response, many of these smaller 71 catchments were upland, relatively wet and
impermeable. Only nine had SAAR values of under 00 mm, while 0 catchments were in high SAAR
areas (over 1500 mm).
The flood frequency (flows for different return period events) estimation procedure consists of three
stages, as for the FEH approach

based on the ratio of the actual site area and the applied area (50 ha).
* If a reliable surface soils class map of the site is available, then IH126 Table 2.12 (Boorman et
al, 1995), can be used to allocate a HOST category to the site soils. IH126 Table 4.16 can then
be used to obtain a corresponding value for SPR (note this is stated as a percentage, rather than
a proportion so will need to be divided by 100). The extra detail provided by HOST is generally
likely to provide an improved estimate of SPR than using the coarse categorisation of the five
SOIL categories, although it should be recognised that SPRHOST was not originally derived for
use in the IH12 equation, and Appendix 5 of Kellagher (201) should be referenced for further
guidance on this issue.

2 Select an appropriate growth curve
QBAR can be factored by the UK FSR regional growth curves (NERC, 1977) for return periods 2 years
and NERC (199) for all other return periods to obtain peak flow estimates for required return periods.
These regional growth curves are constant throughout a region, whatever the catchment type and sie. In
reality it is likely that growth curves become steeper for smaller catchments, so the regional curves may tend
to underestimate high return period flows potentially leading to overdesign of attenuation storage components.
The hydrological regions and corresponding growth curves are given as Figures 24.1 and 24.2, and Table 24.2.

Peak flow rates for each return period can then be estimated as the product of QBAR and the relevant

GREENFIELD SITES: RUNOFF VOLUME ESTIMATION
The greenfield runoff volume for a site is used to define the allowable runoff volume that can be
discharged (at greenfield flow rates) from a development site, in order to protect downstream areas from
increased flood risk due to the development. This is usually defined as the 1100 year 6 hour duration
design event, based on research by Kellagher (2002).
The use of a single event provides a simple, generic approach. The 6 hour duration event is based on the
need to provide adequate protection for small to medium-sied watercourses that tend to be most at risk
from the effects of urbanisation. At alternative criterion may be specified locally.
The objective of this criterion is to allow original greenfield runoff rates to continue, while also controlling
the runoff volume. The alternative is to accept higher volumes of discharge, but to limit all the runoff
to much lower flow rates (eg 2 l/s/ha or as agreed with the local drainage approving body and/or
environmental regulator), otherwise downstream flood risk is likely to rise.
An evaluation of the greenfield runoff volume for the 1100 year 6 hour event can be avoided by using
a simple method to estimate the difference in runoff volume between the developed and greenfield
conditions (Section 24.10).
Greenfield runoff volumes can be calculated in one of two ways
1 Using equations that predict the proportion of runoff (percentage runoff PR) that occurs from the site
for the design event.
A simple assumption can be made that the proportion of rainfall that runs off a greenfield site is not
dependent on catchment wetness, and is thus equal to the SPR (standard percentage runoff) value for
the site soil type. The assumption that SPR is the runoff proportion is a reasonable approximation for
extreme events, even though the actual runoff is also related to catchment wetness.
SPR or PR values are then used to determine the runoff volume by multiplying them by catchment
area and rainfall depth:

The PR model from NERC (195) is presented in Equation 24.4.
2 From design event runoff hydrographs (where rainfall-runoff methods are being used (Section 24.3.1).
This should be for the 100 year, 6 hour event. The difference in approach between 1 and 2 is that, in
the rainfall-runoff model, the standard and dynamic components of percentage runoff are computed
explicitly based on the design estimate of initial soil water content and the dynamic evolution of soil
water content during the course of the rainfall event.
An important issue to note is the crucial influence of soil type on runoff volume. In practice, this indicates
that developments on sandy soils create significant extra runoff volume compared to the pre-development
condition (but it should be possible to manage this volume using infiltration), while developments on clays
generate relatively small amounts of extra runoff (where infiltration design is less likely to be appropriate).

24.5 PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED SITES: PEAK RUNOFF RATE AND RUNOFF VOLUME ESTIMATION
Where a site has been previously developed, there may be agreement that discharge limits can
correspond to rates that exist for the current state of the site (or a proportion of those rates). The
preferred position should be to aspire to meet greenfield runoff rates and volumes, and any relaxation
of this should be subject to an assessment of the current and future capacity of the receiving sewer or
watercourse and agreement with the environmental regulator, drainage approving body and/or relevant
sewerage company. In many cases, runoff volume may be as important as flow rate in terms of protecting
receiving water body flood risk. Local policies, specifically strategic Flood Risk Assessments should be
checked with respect to runoff control requirements for previously developed sites.
Runoff characteristics for a previously developed site can be estimated in a number of ways
1 Any land that has been previously developed is likely to have had a system in place to drain surface
water runoff from the site. This drainage system may or may not have included storage and flow
control systems. Where any drainage system is still operational, peak flow rates at the outfall for the
relevant return periods (usually 11 year, 10 year and 1100 year) can be demonstrated by producing
a simulation model that includes an accurate representation of the drainage system and site area
contributions thus allowing derivation of an appropriate headdischarge relationship at the outfall.
It is recognised that existing drainage systems will probably be overwhelmed for the 10 and 1100
year events and therefore the actual rate of discharge from the site in such scenarios is likely to
be increased by overland flow contributions or surcharging. However, these effects should not be
accounted for, and the discharge limit should be based solely on the flow rate from the piped system
(thus providing a conservative estimate).
2 Where records of the previously developed system are not available (so that the hydraulic
characteristics of the system cannot be determined) or where the drainage system is not in
reasonable working order (ie broken, blocked or no longer operational for other reasons), then one of
the following approaches can be adopted
a The first approach assumes that the runoff from the site is represented by greenfield response
from impermeable soils. The methods for greenfield peak runoff estimation (Section 24.3) and
volume estimation (Section 24.4) should therefore be applied using a high runoff soil type that
51 Part E: Supporting guidance
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
better represents the high levels of runoff that take place from developed surfaces (eg FSR Soil
Type 5 or equivalent lowest permeability soil type for the runoff estimation method used in the
design). This approach should only be used if the site is predominantly urbanised, and it would
not be appropriate for sites with, for example, permeable soils and limited development. In these
situations greenfield runoff rates would normally be a more appropriate target.
b Runoff from the site can be estimated using the urbanisation methods within the ReFH2 software.
Using this method, the impervious area can be set to the area of the impervious surfaces in the
development site.
24.6 THE PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT SITE: PEAK RUNOFF RATE AND RUNOFF VOLUME
ESTIMATION
24.6.1 Introduction
The runoff from the proposed development surfaces will be required as inflows to the drainage system.
Site developments are characterised as having two main categories of surfaces impermeable (paved
and roof) areas and permeable (grassed and vegetated) areas. These surfaces have different runoff
characteristics, so both need to be represented in calculations and models.
Surface water management systems should usually be designed to accommodate the predicted effects of
future climate change by factoring the design rainfall intensities by a climate change uplift factor. This is
discussed in Section 24.7.1. They should also consider likely future development and urban creep on the
site, and suggested factors are presented in Section 24.7.2.
An initial assessment of the peak rates of runoff from developed surfaces can be made using either the
simple modified rational method, described here or the ReFH2 urbanisation method, as described in
Section 24.5 for the previously developed site. These methods are useful for assessing peak flow rates
for initial siing of inlets and conveyance systems. However, a volumetric method using a simulation
model is normally required for siing of storage components, owing to the need to determine multiple
critical durations for individual points in the drainage system. The modified rational method provides a
direct estimate of runoff rate from rainfall intensity, whereas a runoff model is used within a hydraulic
simulation model that also describes the routing and attenuation of the collection and conveyance system
in order to output a peak flow rate.
Whether a peak flow estimation or a volumetric approach is used, there is a need to make assumptions
regarding the proportion of runoff that takes place from both impervious and pervious surfaces for a
specified rainfall event. This can be estimated based on fixed values, for example as suggested by WRc
(2012), or based on a runoff model.
he modified rationa method
The peak runoff rate can be estimated using the equation given in Equation 24.5.
oumetri and routin oeffiients V and CR)
The coefficient of runoff was split into two terms when the modified rational method (HR Wallingford,
191) was originally produced the volumetric runoff coefficient, CV (of the order of 0.6) and the routing
coefficient, CR, (of the order of 1.). However, the routing coefficient (which addresses the fact that some
parts of the site will generate flows to a downstream point faster than others) tends to be ignored.
For paved area runoff, the two coefficients are usually incorporated into a single term with a value of between
0. and 1.0 depending on how effectively the catchment is drained and the level of impermeability.
An equivalent approach is required for the pervious area runoff, with the chosen coefficient reflecting the
proportion of contributing and non-contributing pervious areas, the soil type, site gradient, event sie,
likely antecedent conditions etc.
Chapter 24: Hydrology and hydraulics
519
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Guidance on runoff proportions from extreme events for different surfaces is provided in NERC (195).
WRc (2012) is the industry standard produced by water companies for adoption of drainage for new
development. It proposes the use of 100 runoff from impermeable areas and 0 runoff from pervious
areas. This is known to be suitably conservative for events of between 11 year and 15 year. However,
it is likely to be less appropriate for larger events when the pervious areas start generating significant
runoff. For standard developments that tend to have impermeability ratios of around 5065, this
assumption is regarded as being acceptable, at least in terms of initial design and analysis, as it avoids
having to use the more complicated runoff models.

Rainfall intensity (i)
For the rational method to be used for design purposes, the rainfall intensity (i) for the design time of
concentration needs to be known. This gives the maximum flow rate at a point in the network in order
to sie the conveyance component. The rational method assumes that the whole catchment contributes
runoff to a point in the system that has the longest time of concentration of any drainage branch. The
rainfall intensity for this duration is used to calculate the flow. Rainfall intensitydurationfrequency
curves can be generated using the FSR, the FEH or from appropriate gauged autographic rainfall data.
Alternatively, for an initial assessment of the design of a pipe network (for pipe full flow), a constant
rainfall intensity of 5 mm/hr can be assumed, or 50 mm/hr may be required by some approving bodies
for a more conservative solution (May and Kellagher, 200).
For design of piped urban drainage networks a time of entry of 5 minutes is assumed, and then the time taken
to travel through the network from the furthest point in the catchment at the pipe-full velocity is added. Advice on
this is provided in the modified rational method in Volume of the Wallingford Procedure (HR Wallingford, 191).
24.6.3 UK runoff models
UK runoff models
There are two methods currently recommended for use in the UK for predicting percentage runoff from
developed areas for detailed design purposes:
variable UK runoff model
UKWIR UK runoff model
520 Part E: Supporting guidance
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
The old UK equation or fixed UK runoff model (HR Wallingford, 191) was the original runoff model
of the Wallingford Procedure, but this was officially replaced by the variable UK runoff model equation
(Packman, 1990), although there are still models around that use the fixed runoff model. Revisions to the old
equation are presented together with the variable UK runoff model equation in the Wallingford Procedure
for Europe, (Kellagher, 2000), along with guidance on their use. The UKWIR runoff model (UKWIR, 201)
has only recently been developed, and industry is currently assessing its effectiveness. This latest model is
intended to address some of the limitation of the variable UK runoff model and to take account of the more
detailed HOST classes of soil that are available digitally across the UK. The research report provides a
comparison of the three equations and data on their development, advantages and limitations.
The term Wallingford Procedure is usually used to describe the process or runoff modelling, simulation
modelling (using hydraulic routing methods) and model verification, but only the runoff modelling (ie
estimation of the rate and proportion of runoff from surfaces) is covered here.
All three methods are regression equations where each surface type is assigned a proportion of runoff. In
the fixed UK runoff model, the runoff was a fixed coefficient (although the runoff coefficient value took into
account antecedent conditions). Both subsequent equations have an runoff coefficient that increases as
the ground gets wetter through the storm.
The model equations are summarised in the following sections.
Fixed UK runoff model
The fixed UK runoff model (or old UK equation) is a regression equation that was calibrated against a
large number of events recorded in the UK and overseas. It is given in Equation 24.6.
This method is now outdated and no longer recommended. It has been replaced by later equations and is
only included here for completeness, as it is still used in some industry models.

The variable UK runoff model (or new UK equation) was introduced by the Institute of Hydrology as
a replacement to the original fixed UK runoff model (old UK equation). The dataset used in developing a
calibrated model was a subset of the same data used for the development of the previous approach.
This model provides a variable (increasing) percentage runoff during a rainfall event, in order to take
account of changes in catchment wetness as the storm progresses. This aspect is particularly important
for long duration events where losses reduce as the pervious surfaces become saturated. The model
takes the form set out in Equation 24.7.

surfaces that run directly into the drainage system). The original recommended values of IF are given in
Table 24.3. However, IF values have tended to be applied at around 0.7 in practice in most models.

by the second part of the equation with a runoff value of NAPI / PF. NAPI is a 0-day antecedent
precipitation index (with evapotranspiration subtracted from the rainfall) that is given by a decay function
equation with a decay coefficient, C, related to soil type as shown in Table 24.4.
Design values for NAPI have never been formally
established, although the industry has generally
accepted the findings of a paper by Margetts
(2002). For more information on this topic, see
UKWIR (201). In practice the NAPI design
values for SOIL type 1 and 2 are effectively ero.

the range of 1025 mm and are related to SAAR

be noted that the basis for the decay coefficient

the decay value is generally regarded as being
too high.
The moisture depth parameter, PF, should
normally be set at 200 mm. There is very limited
guidance on modifying this value, and caution is advised if any changes are made.

24.1
A summary of the approach to modelling paved surfaces using the UKWIR UK runoff model
Runoff modelling of the paved components of a catchment has a fixed runoff component and a
variable runoff component.
The variable runoff component is a function of the rainfall depth and rainfall intensity.
Each paved surface type (road, roof, indirectly drained areas) should be modelled with their own
set of parameters:
The fixed runoff component for road surfaces should normally be set to have an effective
impermeability of 0.50.65.
The fixed runoff component for roofs should normally be set to have an effective
impermeability of 0..
The variable components should use a decay coefficient of 0.1, and a soil depth of 10 mm.
The rainfall depth power factor is set at 0.5 and aims to increase the influence of the early
part of the storm in increasing the proportion of runoff.
All parameters can be used to calibrate the model.
Paved runoff (UKWIR runoff model)
The paved component runoff model is very similar to the variable UK runoff model equation. It has a fixed
runoff component (IF PIMP) and a variable runoff component (1 IF) PIMP (to represent rainfall that
is lost on the paved surface). This second term is therefore separated from the pervious component
of the model and routed with the paved surface runoff. It will therefore be more responsive to increasing
wetness than the pervious runoff.
The increase in the rate of runoff during the event is now assumed to be non-linear to weight the increase
in extra runoff to the early part of the storm depth using a power factor of 0.5. The use of a rapid decay
coefficient means that the proportion of runoff is now related to the intensity of the rainfall.
As with the pervious component of the variable UK runoff model equation, the wetness of the paved
surfaces is a continuously calculated value. It uses a 0-day analysis period, but the decay coefficient is set
to 0.1 to ensure the wetness term (NAPI) rapidly reduces to ero after an event. NAPI is allowed to become
negative, to prevent runoff from dry pervious catchments from taking place immediately rainfall commences.
The model allows more than one paved surface category and it is expected that three categories of
paved surface would commonly be used (roads, roofs, indirectly drained paved areas) each potentially
has its own set of parameters.
Pervious runoff (UKWIR runoff model)
The pervious runoff component is addressed in a similar way to the variable UK runoff model equation.
This presumes that all the pervious area in a catchment contributes runoff based on an initial wetness
measure, with an increasing proportion of runoff linked to rainfall depth. However, there are a number of
significant differences built into the UKWIR equation.
Firstly, NAPI is a 0-day calculation, but it is not a function of soil type. The assumption has been made
that antecedent wetness can be represented for all soil types by a single decay function. A value of
0.0.9 is proposed.
The second major difference is the calculation of NAPI, which now uses evaporation, and this can result
in negative NAPI terms (acting rather like a soil moisture model). This has the important advantage of
delivering a negative term for dry periods in summer. When the NAPI term is negative, it is assumed
that this results in no runoff taking place from pervious surfaces. This approach was produced to
provide an increase in differentiation between summer and winter runoff, thus addressing one of the key
requirements of revising the variable UK runoff model.

The equation uses hydrological soil parameters and methods that are currently available to, and
understood by, the water industry.
The use of HOST improves the resolution of soils information and this data can be imported digitally.
All soils are modelled with one decay coefficient (default 0.), with the proportion of runoff
differentiated by the use of the soil specific term, SPR.
All parameters can be modified to calibrate the model.
Runoff from pervious surfaces are ero when the value of NAPI is negative (during dry periods
and in the early part of a rainfall event).
The rainfall depth power factor is set at 0., and aims to limit the influence of very large storm
events in increasing the proportion of runoff.
Each pervious surface type (specific soil category or estimated urban soil characteristic) should
be modelled with its own set of parameters.
The minimum NAPI value is a function of the decay coefficient. It is suggested that a limit is
set for the minimum negative value to around 15 mm.
The decay coefficient should be in the range of 0.70.9 for all soils.
The soil depth default is 5 mm, but this is linked to the rainfall depth power factor.
The minimum value of SPR should be 0.1. Although the maximum value for any soil class is 0.6,
there may be circumstances (eg steep hillsides) when a slightly higher value might be justified.
The rainfall depth power factor default is 0..
Changing of the power factor and the soil depth should be considered together, so that a depth of
0100 mm of NAPI rainfall depth is needed to achieve a runoff of 1.0 SPR runoff (ignoring the
effects of the decay coefficient).
24.7 CLIMATE CHANGE AND URBAN CREEP ALLOWANCES
When estimating runoff rates from development sites for design events, the computed flow should include
an uplift to cater for the effects of climate change impacts on future rainfall intensities. To ensure that
flood risk in the catchment does not increase with time, uplift factors on greenfield runoff rates should not
be applied. Similarly drainage areas should be applied with urban creep factors to take account of a likely
future increases in the impermeability of a site.
24.7.1 Climate change factors
Climate change uplift factors for rainfall intensities, peak river flows and sea level are normally specified
by national government or the environmental regulator. They are regularly updated and therefore not
provided in this document.
Peak river flow and sea level uplifts will be appropriate when considering the potential impact of receiving
water body flood levels on the operation of the SuDS. Rainfall intensity factors will need to be applied to
design rainfall depths for the developed site runoff assessment.
Current recommended climate change allowances should be based on the findings of UKCP09, with
regional allowances and consideration of uncertainty, rather than fixed national allowances. For some
regions, the upper end estimate from the UKCP09 impacts research is much higher than the suggested
change factor, and in such scenarios it would be prudent to at least examine the sensitivity of SuDS
designs, particularly for high-risk developments, to a range of possible climate change impacts.
526 Part E: Supporting guidance
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
The hyetograph rainfall intensity values for the design storm events should be increased by the relevant
climate uplift factor for the required design life of the system.
Normally, residential sites use the 2052115 design horion, but shorter horions may be appropriate for
commercial and industrial developments.
It should be noted that storage volumes will approximately increase by the square of any rainfall uplift
factor. This means that a 10 increase in rainfall (an uplift factor of 1.1) will result in a 20 increase in
storage (uplift factor of 1.21), while a 0 increase in rainfall will nearly double the storage required.
Other climate change projections, including reduced summer rainfall, may have implications for
vegetation resilience and water quality performance of SuDS components (water quality criterion 2,
Section 4.2.3)
24.7.2 Urban creep factors
Urban creep is defined as any increase in the impervious area that is drained to an existing drainage system
without planning permission being required, and therefore without any consideration of whether the capacity
of the receiving sewerage system can accommodate the increased flow. For example, the construction of
patios, conservatories, small extensions, paved driveways etc (post initial construction) may all result in an
increase in surface runoff and therefore reduce the level of service of the drainage system.
To allow for future urban expansion within the development, an increase in paved surface area of 10 is
often suggested if there is no specified value stipulated by the drainage approval body or planning authority.
24.8 DESIGNING FOR INTERCEPTION
Interception can be defined as the capture and retention on site of the first 5 mm (or other specified depth)
of the majority of all rainfall events. Designing for Interception has two key benefits
1 Runoff characteristics from the site will more closely reflect greenfield runoff behaviour (where runoff
will not occur for the majority of small rainfall events) and this will help to protect the morphology and
ecology of the receiving surface water body.
2 The pollution load to any receiving surface water body that could potentially be associated with the
total runoff volume from all such small events will be retained on site where it will have time to
biodegrade and/or be acted on by natural treatment processes.
Interception can be delivered using one or a combination of processes
rainwater harvesting
infiltration
evapotranspiration using temporary shallow ponding or storage within the soil or upper aggregate layers
Any Interception method that potentially allows the transfer of contaminants to groundwater via the
underlying soil pore water or soil matrix should follow the guidance in Section 26.7.
Interception cannot be guaranteed for every rainfall event, due to the variability in evapotranspiration and
rainfall through the year and the corresponding variability in soil moisture storage levels. Interception is far
less likely to be achievable during extended wet periods where soils are saturated, so for any rainfall event,
the design should have an associated probability of delivering Interception for any contributing impermeable
area. Receiving streams and rivers are likely to be under greater stress during summer months (with lower
available dilution levels and with flora and fauna less likely to be tolerant of rapid flow rates and high water
levels at this time of year). It is therefore suggested that any criteria for compliance should differentiate
between summer and winter for example, for a 5 mm Interception depth, compliance for 0 of rainfall
events could be required during summer months and 50 compliance during winter months.
Chapter 24: Hydrology and hydraulics
527
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Designing systems to achieve specific probabilities of compliance requires analysis using a model
of the drainage system and continuous time series rainfall data, which may not be an approach that
is accessible or usable by designers. Simple approaches are therefore set out in Box 24.3. Such
approaches cannot evaluate the actual probability of compliance, but can provide a useful design aid.
Alternatively, some assumed compliance scenarios are set out in Table 24.6.
BOX
24.3
Simple approaches to Interception delivery and compliance assessment
Rainwater harvesting only
Rainwater harvesting systems, whether designed for just reducing potable water demand or for surface
water management as well, can be assumed to deliver effective Interception for the contributing surfaces.
Infiltration ere te system is esine for tis urose
Where SuDS are designed to infiltrate more than 5 mm from the contributing catchment for all
events, then Interception will be effectively delivered.
Evapotranspiration only
Assuming that rainfall is evenly distributed through the year, the effective monthly runoff contribution
from 1 m2 of paved surface is:
0 days (700 mm/65 days) 50 percentage runoff 29 mm of effective runoff
(Note the 700 mm represents the annual average rainfall, this can be varied depending on location
50 runoff is appropriate for small rainfall events.)
The evaporative capacity of 1 m2 of vegetative surface (without any infiltration capacity) for a peak
summer month approximates to:
0 days mm/day 90 mm of effective rainfall
(Note the mm/day is approximately the free surface evaporation rate in mid-summer for the UK.)
Therefore, the area for which Interception can theoretically be delivered by a 1 m2 vegetated
surface, in a peak summer month is
90/29 m2
The effectiveness of the vegetated surface will be less if the average evapotranspiration capacity is
less. In wet periods (whether in mid-summer or at other times), compliance will be less than 100.
This analysis assumes that all rainfall needs to be retained. In practice, there are a number of events
that are greater than 5 mm and in these cases the soil would not be expected to retain all the runoff.
If one assumes that 25 of the runoff does not need to be retained to make an allowance for these
larger events, this increases the paved area ratio served from to .
Where the method is being applied to SuDS components with side slopes (eg swales or detention
basins), an allowance should be made for the effective wetted width (ie the width of the surface that
would be wetted when conveying runoff for the 5 mm rainfall depth event), rather than just taking
the base of the component. For example, although the base of a swale might only be 1 m wide, the
effective wetted width might be considered to extend over another 12 m. This would increase the
area served by the system.
Allowance should be made for the variability in the rainfall, so it is suggested that temporary storage
of 50 mm of rainfall is needed in the soil store beneath the vegetated surface. Assuming 20 voids
ratio, the depth of available soil needed is 250 mm. Water at depths 250 mm is much less likely to
be lost through evapotranspiration.
Infiltration ere te system is not seifially esine for tis urose
Unless the vegetated surface is lined, there will usually be small amounts of infiltration taking place from
runoff events. A rate of infiltration of 1 107 m/s (which is a nominal rate and would not be considered
for infiltration design specifically) represents approximately 260 mm of infiltration per month.

BOX
24.3
Simple approaches to Interception delivery and compliance assessment
When this infiltration rate is combined with the evapotranspiration rate in summer (see above), this
amounts to a combined depth of 50 mm which, when compared to an effective runoff depth of 29 mm
per month, means that the system can deliver Interception for a contributing area of around 12 times
the vegetated area. As for evapotranspiration, consideration should be given to the actual wetted area
over which infiltration might be considered to occur for small events in non-saturated soils, provided
that the design of the component encourages runoff across the full area before discharge.
Research on Interception by Kellagher (201) showed that factors well in excess of 25 could be
achieved using temporary storage depths ( 100 mm) above a 250 mm depth of well-prepared
engineered soil and the use of marginal infiltration soil capacities. It can be seen that the infiltration
rate is a crucial value for the analysis, so site testing should be undertaken to provide some
justification of the rate assumed.
Wherever marginal infiltration is used to deliver Interception, the guidance on appropriate risk
management design for Interception to protect groundwater should be followed (Section 26.7).

than the permeable pavement area.
Where the infiltration capacity of the ground below the pavement is greater than 1 106 m/s,
up to 5 times the permeable pavement area can be added as extra contributing area.
Where the permeable pavement also drains an adjacent impermeable area and is lined,
compliance cannot be deemed to have been achieved and extra downstream Interception
components will be required.*

Filter strips/swales2
Roads drained by filters strips/swales, where the longitudinal gradient of the vegetated area
is less than 1100, are suitable for Interception delivery for impermeable surface areas up to 5
times the base of the vegetated surface area receiving the runoff.
Components steeper than 1 in 100 cannot be deemed to provide Interception unless
additional effective Interception design can be demonstrated.
Any filter strip/swale that is unlined, has a gradient less than 1 in 100 and has an infiltration capability
greater than 1 106 m/s can be assumed to comply with Interception for a contributing area up to
25 times the area, or a larger area where infiltration capacities and design characteristics allow.
Interception cannot be deemed to have been provided for impermeable areas draining to a
swale within 5 m from the swale outlet, unless the swale is flat and has a slightly raised outlet
to create a temporary storage one to encourage infiltration before runoff takes place.
Greater loading ratios can be achieved by providing flat swales with greater temporary
storage and infiltration, but these require detailed design, based on the use of appropriate
continuous rainfall time series.
Infiltration
trenches2 Roads drained by infiltration trenches can be considered to provide Interception.
Detention basins2
Areas of the site drained to detention basins with a flat unlined base (without specific
provision for routing low flows directly to the outlet) can be assumed to comply, where the
drained impermeable surface area is less than 5 times the vegetated surface area receiving
the runoff for any soil type. The area of the basin that is assumed to contribute to Interception
of runoff should be below the outlet level of the basin.
Areas up to 25 times the base area of the basin can be assumed to meet Interception
requirements where infiltration rates are greater than 1 106 m/s.
Higher loading ratios can be achieved where specific provision is made for water being stored
below the outlet pipe and higher infiltration rates exist. Where a basin is designed to infiltrate
runoff, specific provision should be made for the upstream control of sediments to minimise
risks of waterlogging, high maintenance costs and reduced component amenity value.
Bioretention areas
and rain gardens2
Areas of the site drained to unlined bioretention components can be assumed to comply1
where the impermeable surface area is less than 5 times the vegetated surface area
receiving the runoff. They can be designed to deliver Interception for larger areas, where
suitable infiltration capacity is available.
Ponds Areas drained by ponds (with a permanent water pool that is effectively maintained by the
outlet structure) are not assumed to deliver Interception.
Notes
1 Where individual components do not provide sufficient Interception for the area draining to them, Interception capacity can also
be provided by downstream components. Detailed calculations will be needed to demonstrate compliance in this case.
2 Where these systems are unlined or designed for infiltration, appropriate consideration should be given to the adequate
protection of groundwater (Chapter 4, Table 4.3, and Section 26.7).
24.9 DESIGNING FOR ATTENUATION STORAGE
24.9.1 General description
Attenuation storage is needed to temporarily store water during periods when the runoff rates from the
development site exceed the allowable discharge rates from the site. Attenuation storage volumes are
designed to drain at a rate controlled by the outlet structure.
Attenuation storage can be provided on site using structural controls (either above or below the ground
surface), non-structural features and/or landscaped depressions. It can be provided by a storage component
that is normally dry, or above a permanent water body that is, a pond or wetland (Figures 24.4 and 24.5).
50 Part E: Supporting guidance
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Figure 2. Attenuation storage in dry or wet components
Figure 2.5 Examples of attenuation storage locations
Attenuation storage can be implemented either
on line or off line. On-line storage uses a storage
component through which all runoff from the
upstream contributing catchment flows. Off-line
storage is a storage component that is separate
from the main drainage conveyance path, to which
runoff is diverted when flow rates or levels exceed a
threshold (Figure 24.6).
The advantage of off-line storage is that the volume
of storage provided is minimised as the pass-forward
flow rate is maximised before the storage starts
filling. However, it does mean that the storage facility
cannot combine as a treatment facility, as frequent
events (that require treatment) will bypass the
component and discharge directly downstream.

24.9.2 Stage–storage design
A stagestorage curve defines the relationship
between the depth of water and associated
storage volume in a storage component. An
example is given in Figure 24.7.
The storage can be estimated using Simpson’s
rule a method for numerical integration
(Atkinson, 199). However, a less sophisticated
approximation can be derived by averaging
the areas for each height elevation over the
full storage depth, and then integrating these
using Equation 24.9.

24.9.3 Stage–discharge design
Simple outlet structures will only discharge at their maximum discharge rate at the maximum depth
of water at which the water is stored. A stagedischarge curve (Figure 24.9) defines the relationship
between the depth of water and the discharge or outflow from a storage facility. For simple assessments
of storage requirements, this relationship can be accounted for by including a 250 extra storage
allowance and using the design discharge flow rate. The relationship can be modelled explicitly using
detailed simulation models.
52 Part E: Supporting guidance
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
A storage component usually requires two
outlets: a primary outlet and a secondary (or
emergency) overflow route. A pipe, weir, orifice
plate or other appropriate outlet is generally
used for the principal outlet and an emergency
spillway weir normally provides a bypass for
floodwater for flows that exceed the design
capacity of the component and as protection
against blockage of the main outlet. The
principal outlet may need to have a multiple
flow control system, so that both 11 year and
1100 year flow rates are adequately controlled.
Guidance on the design of inlets and outlet
controls is set out in Chapter 28.
Figure 2.9 Example of a stage discharge curve
24.9.4 Initial attenuation storage volume assessment
A method that gives an initial estimate of the required attenuation storage volume is provided in
Kellagher (201).
An alternative to the Kellagher (201) approach is to develop a simple lumped simulation model of the
storage system with a limiting discharge throttle and an overflow. The volume passing over the overflow
is then the storage required for that specific event and throttle. A range of different storm durations will
be required to determine the maximum spill volume. This method will underpredict the actual volume of
storage needed as the headdischarge relationship for the hydraulic control is not being considered.
Therefore, a further allowance of 25 should be applied to the first estimate of storage to allow for this
approximation. An accurate model of the storage and conveyance system should be built at the earliest
possible stage, to ensure that approximate estimates can be confirmed.
24.9.5 Detailed attenuation storage volume assessment
For most sites, a detailed model of the drainage system will be run at detailed design stage, with accurate
depth storage and head discharge relationships represented accurately. This will enable checks to be
made of the discharge rate controls and the adequacy of the proposed storages.
24.10 DESIGNING FOR LONG-TERM STORAGE
24.10.1 General description
Additional runoff volumes from developments can cause increases in flood risk downstream of the site,
even where peak flows from the site are controlled to greenfield rates (Section 3.1.2).
Therefore, for extreme events, in addition to the standard for controlling the peak rate of runoff, there
is also a standard that requires runoff volume control for the 1100 year, 6 hour event (Section 3.3.1).
This is particularly critical for catchments that are susceptible to flooding downstream of the proposed
development.
The difference in runoff volume between the development state and the equivalent greenfield (or possibly
pre-development state where this is considered to be acceptable) is termed the Long-Term Storage
Volume. It is this volume that should be prevented from leaving the site (via rainwater harvesting and/or
infiltration) or, where this is not possible, controlled so that it discharges at very low rates that will have
negligible impact on downstream flood risk. Only the greenfield (or pre-developed) runoff volume should
be allowed to discharge at greenfield (or pre-developed) rates.
Chapter 24: Hydrology and hydraulics
5
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Where there is extra volume generated by the development that has to be discharged (because there are
no opportunities for it to be infiltrated and/or used on site), this volume should be released at a very low
rate (eg 2 l/s/ha or as agreed with the local drainage approving body and/or environmental regulator)
and the 1100 year greenfield allowable runoff rate reduced to take account of this extra discharge
(Kellagher, 2002).
An alternative approach to managing the extra runoff volumes from extreme events separately from the
main drainage system is to release all runoff (above the 1 year event) from the site at a maximum rate
of 2 l/s/ha or BAR, whichever is the higher value (or as agreed with the drainage approving body and/or
environmental regulator). This avoids the need to undertake more detailed calculations and modelling.
Kellagher (2002) demonstrates that if discharges are not limited to less than l/s/ha, the drainage system
will generally not be effective at retaining sufficient water on the site to prevent an increase in flood risk
in the receiving catchment. A discharge limit of 2 l/s/ha (or BAR, which allows for higher discharge rates
for specific soil types) has generally been accepted as an appropriate industry standard in the UK, unless
alternative site or catchment specific limits are agreed based on local risk evaluation.
reenfied sites S oume estimation
A simple approach to the calculation of Long-Term Storage Volume is provided in Kellagher (201) and set
out in Equation 24.10. This approach uses a fixed percentage runoff for pervious surfaces defined by SPR.
The formula allows assumptions to be made as to whether some or all of the paved and pervious areas
contribute runoff. The formula assumes that only 0 (ie the 0. coefficient in the equation) runoff occurs
from paved areas, but 100 runoff can be assumed if it is felt that a more conservative assumption
is needed. The pervious surfaces are assumed to have the same runoff coefficient before and after
development. However, where sites are landscaped to prevent green areas contributing runoff or where
pervious surfaces are likely to be heavily compacted following development, then adjustments to the
coefficients can be made accordingly.

The ReFH2 software can also be used to estimate the development and greenfield site runoff
hydrographs using a dynamic estimate of percentage runoff (reflecting the evolution of soil water content
for pervious surfaces during the event) (CEH and WHS, 2015). These hydrographs can then be compared
to determine the difference in runoff volume.
Figures 24.10 and 24.11 illustrate the difference in runoff volume for the two extremes: fully disconnected
pervious areas and fully connected pervious areas for the five different soil types, for any development
density. By multiplying the x axis value by the catchment area and the rainfall depth, a storage volume
can be derived.
These graphs demonstrate the very great impacts of different soil types, the importance of using
infiltration to disconnect impermeable areas from the drainage network, and the need to be efficient in
designing the general landscape to disconnect pervious areas.

Where the environmental regulator or drainage approval body agrees that the runoff volume for a

new and existing development scenario. The application of the equivalent approach within the ReFH2

The use of this equation assumes that a positive drainage system can be demonstrated to be operational

24.10.4 The practicalities of delivering volumetric runoff control
Any approach that delivers a reduction in the volume of runoff from the site will help in minimising the
volume of storage that requires attenuation and slow release. Runoff reduction approaches include the
use of vegetation to prevent runoff from indirectly drained areas, infiltration (both where infiltration rates
are considered suitable for standard infiltration design Chapter 25) and also where infiltration rates
are poor, but some runoff reduction can be assumed (Section 24.8), and rainwater harvesting (where
designed to deliver surface water management Chapter 11).
Volumetric control only has to be met at the 1100 year return period. Up until that point, events need
only be constrained to the peak greenfield discharge rates. In practice, particularly where the Long-Term
Storage Volume at 1100 year is likely to be large, some form of spill or discharge control will need to
come into effect at return periods of 15 years or 110 years, in order to ensure that the full volume is
captured for the 1100 year event.
In order to design a drainage system to minimise storage requirements (and, therefore, the space
allocated to it and associated cost), consideration should be given to the feasibility of designing the
normal attenuation storage units to overflow into the Long-Term Storage area when large events occur.
This requires careful consideration of levels, but it does allow the off-line storage to be a multi-functional
space that is, it can have a primary function (eg car park, agriculture, recreation or amenity area) and
will only be required infrequently for surface water management.
The critical duration event for the on-line attenuation system may be less than 6 hours, but more likely it
will be much longer (eg around 2 hours). This means that the design needs to take account of two event
durations the critical duration for the attenuation storage system and the 6 hour event, which for the
1100 year return period should meet the greenfield volume discharge criterion.
Any space that has another primary function should be designed with the frequency, depth, duration and
velocity of flooding as key considerations. For example, in the case of temporary car park flooding, a
56 Part E: Supporting guidance
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
maximum depth of around 150 mm would probably be required to avoid damage to vehicles for any sie
of event. The allowable duration of flooding would be a function of what might be an acceptable level of
risk and inconvenience. The impact of the effect of flooding (for instance, saturation of a football pitch for
up to a week after the flooding occurs, or potential damaging effects of sediment on a pervious pavement)
needs to be evaluated and mitigated. Local communities, site owners, operators and people who use or
visit the area should understand the dual functionality of temporary flood storage areas.
Maintenance procedures should be put in place to ensure that the functionality of the area as a surface
water management feature is never compromised and to rehabilitate the area following a flood. Effective
emergency procedures should be put in place for when the area is likely to fill with water. The drain-down of
the area may be by infiltration or by direct throttle control, but any solution should be practical and robust in
coming into effect in a proper manner even though it only has to operate rarely. Where the discharge rate
has to be very low, the outfall structure will need to be designed to reduce the risk of blockage.
24.11 CONVEYANCE DESIGN
The layout of the development site, particularly the roads and the drainage system, should be designed so
that natural overland conveyance pathways are used to manage surface runoff, where appropriate. Modern
developments often have terraced houses, and care over building orientation and position, landscape design
and the creation of long barriers to floodwaters is needed to avoid increasing the risk of local flooding.
24.11.1 Surface conveyance systems
Surface conveyance systems, such as swales, channels and ditches, should be designed to convey
the peak design flow rate. The return period normally specified is the 10 year event (ie this should be
conveyed before overland flow is permitted), but this level of service might be either increased or reduced
depending on the consequence of flooding at a location. Manning’s formula can be used to check on the
capacity of individual channels (Equation 24.12), but the easiest way of checking the system performance
is to carry out hydraulic simulation modelling using Manning’s or ColebrookWhite equations.
Two-dimensional mesh models can be used to show the flow paths, depths and velocities across the
site for the 1100 year or larger events. As with channels, there is a need to use appropriate hydraulic
roughness coefficients in the 2D models for the overland flows.
Note that as SuDS are both volumetric storage units and conveyance elements, flooding will occur at
different points in the site for different selected storm durations.

gradients. In general, pipes should be at least 150 mm in diameter, and these should not be laid on a
slope that is flatter than 1 in 150. Where larger pipes are required, pipes can be laid at gradients using the
inverse of the pipe diameter, so a 225 mm pipe can be laid at 1 in 225 or steeper and a 00 mm pipe at
1 in 00 or steeper. For pipes larger than 500 mm, gradients should not generally be flatter than 1 in 500
due to construction tolerances. Pipes and manufactured channel components should be sied to carry the
maximum design event peak flow rate using product literature, pipe capacity tables or hydraulic simulation
modelling. All pipe networks to be adopted should conform to the most up-to-date guidance from the
relevant sewerage undertakers (at the time of publication these are WRc 2007, 2010 and 2012). Relevant
building regulations should be referenced for specifications for drainage pipework serving single properties.
24.12 EXCEEDANCE DESIGN
Exceedance flow management on the site should be designed to mitigate the risks to people and property
associated with:
1 rates of runoff exceeding the designed capacity of the drainage system (for both conveyance and
storage components)
2 restrictions on outflows from the drainage system due to high levels in the receiving water body
system blockages or other failures.
Very high rainfall intensities can occur for short periods in the UK, and these can overwhelm pipe-based
systems for brief periods. SuDS tend to have longer-duration critical events and can often absorb the
impact of short thunderstorms much better than pipe-based systems, even though their return period may
be high. However, in all cases, there will be events that cause flooding at points in the network if the event
is severe enough and is of a relevant duration. The return period to use to evaluate these events is often
limited to 1100 years with a climate change factor. However, dam break risks, nuclear establishments
or critical infrastructure all warrant evaluation of the impact of more severe (less frequent) events. The
appropriate return period to use should be based on the implications of the consequence of such an
event occurring. There are some sources of guidance on this, such as the application of the Reservoirs
Act 1975 or the requirements of the nuclear industry, but in most cases this will be a matter for site
specific determination.
Particular attention is needed on steep sites, due to focused flow paths and high velocities that might
provide a scour risk or a haard to people. Steep slopes also require attention in terms of modifying the
runoff model, as saturated pervious areas can contribute rapid and high levels of runoff.
When the drainage system is overloaded, the surface water runs down to low points on the site. It is,
therefore, important to consider this effect, and design the site layout and topography to adequately
manage these flood risks. Although it is relatively easy to spot flood risk areas by examining the site
contours and layout, the magnitude of flood ponding will be significantly influenced by the characteristics
of the site and the drainage system. At the stage of initial evaluation, identifying the extent of flooding at
these locations is difficult, as they can only be effectively determined using detailed simulation models.
Sites are particularly at risk during the construction period, as areas stripped of topsoil can act in a
similar manner to paved surfaces and can generate very high rates of runoff, as well as contributing high
levels of sediment and debris. This requires consideration when designing a temporary surface water
management system and environmental protection during the construction phase, and when designing
SuDS to manage scenarios where the development is being implemented in phases.
The design of exceedance flow management systems should therefore take account of
the location, use and capacity of exceedance flood pathways

downstream of it

issue associated with stream flooding or river floodplains).
Roads may be appropriate to use for storing flood water for brief periods of time on an infrequent basis,
subject to their maximum traffic speed and designation. Roads should not be used to store water on a
frequent basis or where the speed of the traffic is such that any stored water poses a potential accident risk.
Detail on designing for exceedance can be found in Digman et al (2006) and Digman et al (201).
24.13 SURFACE WATER PUMPING STATION DESIGN
Where surface water management for the site cannot avoid the use of pumping, the pumping station
should be designed in accordance with BS EN 752200. Where the pumping station is to be adopted by
the sewerage undertaker, it should also be designed in accordance with WRc (2007, 2010 and 2012).

25.1 GENERAL CONCEPTS
Infiltration systems allow surface water runoff to infiltrate into the ground over a period
of time, thus reducing the volume of runoff during a rainfall event. Infiltration systems
can deliver Interception for the upstream contributing catchment surface (Section 24.8)
and can also help reduce the attenuation storage volume requirements required for the
site (Section 24.9).
The use of infiltration to dispose of surface water runoff also has a number of other
important benefits
It can help replenish aquifers local to the site through deep infiltration and/or
act to support local river base flows and wetland systems via shallow infiltration
processes.
It can help support local soil moisture levels and vegetation. In urban areas this
may reduce the adverse effects that trees can have on foundations by reducing the
potential for shrinkage of soils.
For a soil to be suitable for infiltrating design runoff events, it should be
permeable, and
unsaturated.
Also, it should be of sufficient thickness and extent to disperse the water effectively.
Figure 25.1 is a schematic of a typical infiltration system.
There are a number of constraints to the use of infiltration. These should be fully
evaluated for any site and any potential infiltration location, to ensure that risks are
minimised (Section 25.2). The rate at which infiltration might occur together with
the design standard of service of the system and the contributing catchment area
will influence the area of the infiltration surface and the volume of temporary storage
required. Guidance on establishing appropriate infiltration rates is set out in Sections
25.2 and 25.3.
For further detail on the hydraulic design of infiltration systems, see Bettess (1996).

25.2 Figure 25.1 Typical surface water management infiltration system
EVALUATING POTENTIAL CONSTRAINTS TO THE USE OF INFILTRATION
The following considerations should be fully evaluated before determining the extent to which infiltration
can be used on a site
soil type and infiltration capacity
groundwater level beneath the site
risk of ground instability, subsidence or heave due to infiltration
risk of slope instability or solifluction (the slow creep of saturated soils down slopes) due to infiltration
risk of pollution from mobilising existing contaminants on the site due to infiltration
risk of pollution from infiltrating polluted surface water runoff
risk of groundwater flooding due to infiltration
risk of groundwater leakage into the combined sewer due to infiltration
Each of these is discussed in more detail in the following subsections.
Infiltration surfaces can be at or near the ground surface and spread over a wide area (eg basin), or at
a point location (eg soakaway). The risks posed by infiltrating water to nearby structures and slopes or
groundwater become greater the higher the ratio of the contributing catchment area to infiltration surface
area. For example, large-volume deep soakaways are more likely to cause adverse effects than small
shallow basins or infiltration from pervious surfaces.
Preliminary information on whether a site may be suitable for infiltration can be obtained from
existing geological and hydrogeological studies and mapping for the site
geohaard mapping (eg the British Geological Survey infiltration SuDS map (BGS, 2015))
records of potential contamination at or beneath the site
borehole records or groundwater observations relevant to the site
aquifer designations at or near the site.
Infiltration on sites where there is storage of potential pollutants (eg industrial sites with chemical storage)
is likely to require an environmental permit. The acceptability of infiltration at any site and the design of
risk mitigation measures is set out in Chapter 4, Table 4.3 and Chapter 26.

nfitration aait of the sois
The rate at which infiltration occurs depends on the properties of the soils and the underlying geology
through which the water is discharged. The capacity of the soil to infiltrate water is given by the infiltration
coefficient. This is the long-term infiltration rate into the soil divided by the area of infiltration. The
infiltration rate is related to a soil’s permeability.
The permeability of a saturated soil, k, is its ability to transmit fluid under a hydraulic pressure gradient.
It is often called the coefficient of permeability or hydraulic conductivity. Darcy’s law defines the flow per
unit area under saturated conditions. Infiltration of water into soil above the water table will most likely be
into partially saturated soils where the relationship between soil properties and flow is far more complex
and is described by non-linear differential equations. Because of the difficulty in solving the equations, an
empirical constant infiltration rate or coefficient, q, is used (derived from infiltration tests).
Where water is free-draining vertically in an unsaturated soil with a reasonably steady flow system it is
reasonable to assume a unit hydraulic gradient (Watkins, 1995). Under these conditions the infiltration
rate, q, is numerically equivalent to the soil coefficient of permeability, k.
Permeability or infiltration rate will be high for coarse-grained soils such as sands and gravels and low
for fine soils such as silts and clays. However, it should be noted that in the UK, sand and gravel deposits
often have a high silt or clay content, which will reduce their infiltration rate significantly.
Table 25.1 gives typical infiltration coefficients for different soil textures. Soil textures are defined by
the proportion of different-sied particles as shown in Figure 25.2.
Figure 25.2 Soil texture classification (from LandIS, 2015)
Chapter 25 Infiltration design methods
545
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
This classification is different from the description systems used by geotechnical engineers in site
investigation reports, which should follow BS ISO 16-12002. Further information on the properties
of soil that are important in infiltration design are provided by Blake (2010). This paper also discusses how
increased groundwater levels can reduce the infiltration rate of soils and provides a reduction coefficient
to allow for this effect in design.
The figures in Table 25.1 provide a useful first indicator of the magnitude of the infiltration capacity, but
the large ranges reported illustrate the significant influence of factors such as soil packing, soil structure,
swelling clay content and the presence of bedding, jointing or other fissures in rock. Also, construction
activities can severely affect infiltration rates if care is not taken to protect against compaction or blockage
from fines. In some cases, infiltration of water into rock material can cause a reduction of infiltration
capacity with time as the rock weathers. This is especially important with some fractured mudstones
where initial high infiltration rates soon reduce as the rock softening and joints become infilled.

Therefore, field tests should always be undertaken in order to determine infiltration coefficients for design
purposes. Infiltration testing is described in Section 25.3. Any testing should be as extensive as possible and
supported by evidence of wider soil characteristics, in order to avoid misrepresentation of relevant soil properties.
Figure 25.3 illustrates an example of where local testing may not adequately characterise the soil horions.
If infiltration is proposed at conceptual design stage and there are no infiltration test results available,
alternative proposals for discharge should be provided. This will ensure that if infiltration tests show it is
not possible, the site can still be effectively drained.
Infiltration viability should be given full consideration where rates of 106 m/s or greater exist on the site
(subject to geotechnical and contamination considerations). Where rates are less than that, the soils can
still usefully be used for Interception delivery, but disposal of significant volumes of runoff may not be
cost-effective or appropriate, unless there is a large area of land available for this purpose.
It should be noted that Interception does not necessarily require any infiltration capacity, as it can also be
delivered via green roofs, bioretention systems etc.

Groundwater levels should be investigated to ensure that the base of the proposed infiltration component
is at least 1 m above the maximum anticipated groundwater level (taking account of seasonal variations
in levels and any underlying trends). This should include assessment of relevant groundwater/borehole
records, maps and on-site monitoring in wells. Guidance on the design of SuDS in areas with high
groundwater is set out in Section 8.3. A 1 m separation distance ensures a depth of unsaturated soils
to help ensure the infiltration performance of the component and protect underlying groundwater from
contamination (Section 25.2.5).
eohaards
Geotechnical advice should be taken and geotechnical properties of surrounding soils should be checked
to ensure that the infiltration of water will not pose an unacceptable risk to the site and/or local area. It
should be established that infiltration will not cause significant risk of instability (eg of retaining walls,
slopes, solution features or loosely consolidated fill) or movement that could adversely affect any nearby
buildings or other structures.
The potential risk of adverse effects from infiltrating water will depend on the volume of water being
discharged along with the depth and plan area of the infiltration system. The smaller the area of the
system in relation to the drained area, the greater the risk.
A geotechnical investigation is likely to be required to ensure that the ground conditions are suitable and
to check the likely performance of the infiltration component. Figure 25.4 provides a decision tree for the
assessment of geohaards for infiltration system. Further guidance on the design of SuDS in areas with
unstable soils or backfill is set out in Sections 8.6 and 8.7.
Where infiltration is proposed closer than 5 m to the foundations of buildings or structures (except
for a permeable pavement that does not take any extra impermeable catchment such as the roof)
this assessment should be approved by a suitably qualified professional such as a registered ground
engineering adviser. The BGS infiltration SuDS map (BGS, 2015) is a useful source of information. Advice
on small-scale infiltration closer than 5 m to buildings is provided on www.susdrain.org
Infiltration near slopes also requires careful assessment of the impact of the moisture on slope stability.
Over time the infiltration can cause an increase in moisture content of the soils below the slope and
lead to instability. This is especially important near to slopes that are marginally stable. Such slopes
can include manmade slopes (eg cuttings or embankments) or slopes that are or have been subject to
solifluction. Some local authorities have solifluction maps showing areas where this may be an issue.

CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Guidance on the design of SuDS on sloping sites is set out in Section 8.4. Further information on
geotechnical issues relating to infiltration can be found in Bettess (1996).
Site ontamination
Infiltration can be used on many (but not all) contaminated sites. However, caution should be exercised
when proposals include using infiltration methods on contaminated sites because they have the potential
to cause pollution if the system is not carefully designed or managed. New pathways for pollutants to
groundwater must not be created nor must contaminants be mobilised. Guidance on the design of SuDS
for contaminated land sites is set out in Section 8.2.
An assessment of the potential for deterioration in groundwater quality due to infiltration (eg due to the
mobilisation of contamination) should be undertaken before detailed design. This should consider the spatial and
vertical distribution of contamination in relation to the location of infiltration devices and also the nature of the
contaminants and whether they are mobile. Details of any remediation or contamination sealing strategies
either previously undertaken or proposed as part of the development site design should be carefully evaluated.
All contamination evaluation assessments should be undertaken by a qualified geo-environmental
engineer or similarly qualified person and may require a site investigation with contamination testing. The
BGS infiltration SuDS map (BGS, 2015) can provide useful preliminary information.
Figure 25. Decision guide for the use of infiltration systems
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
roundater oution
If the surface water runoff is polluted, there is a risk that infiltration systems may introduce pollutants
into the soil and ultimately into the groundwater. Checks should be undertaken to confirm that the soils
beneath any proposed infiltration component are suitable to provide adequate protection to the underlying
groundwater. The SuDS design should also ensure adequate treatment of the runoff before infiltration.
Requirements for water quality management for groundwater protection are set out in Chapter 4.
Methods for meeting these requirements are set out in Chapter 26.
Any requirements for environmental permits should be checked before conceptual design stage (Chapter 7).
roundater oodin
An assessment should be undertaken of the potential effect of infiltration on groundwater levels local to
any infiltration component and the potential wider impact of multiple infiltration components within the
site, with respect to groundwater flood risk. The use of infiltration for steep sites can increase the risk of
springs developing lower down the slope in layered geology/steep topography.
roundaterombined seer interation
An assessment should be completed of the risk of groundwater leakage into any local foul or combined
sewers owing to introducing infiltration drainage. The risk of water infiltrating to a sewer will depend on
the area of the base of the infiltration system compared to the catchment for example, infiltration over
the wide area of a pervious pavement that is only managing water that falls directly on it will be a low risk.
Other factors to consider are the depth of soil between the sewer and the base of the infiltration device,
horiontal separation and the age and likely condition of the sewer.
25.3 INFILTRATION TESTING METHODS
Infiltration tests should be carried out in accordance with Bettess (1996), which is based on the design
approach in BRE (1991). The test measures the rate at which water soaks away from the test pit and
gives an infiltration rate in m/s or m/h. It is important that the test is carried out in accordance with the
report and that the test pit is filled three times. Repeating the test in this way can reduce the measured
infiltration rate by at least half an order of magnitude each time the test is repeated, and is likely to reflect
realistic event conditions as shown by the example in Figure 25.5.
Figure 25.5 Example of reduction in infiltration rate with successive tests
Chapter 25 Infiltration design methods
59
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
In some cases it may not be possible to carry out tests in trial pits due to depth or access constraints. In
this case, tests can be carried out in boreholes. The tests should follow the procedure in accordance with
BS EN ISO 2222-22012. Falling head tests should still be repeated at least three times, as required in
BRE (1991). Care should also be taken in the interpretation of the results, as a smaller volume of water
is entering the ground during the test. Ideally, falling head tests should be repeated as many times as
possible to increase the volume of water entering the ground.
One of the main risks to soakaway performance is inadequate infiltration testing, because of either time
constraints at the planning stage or cost. If the water level in a test does not drop sufficiently quickly to
do three tests in a day, it indicates low infiltration capacity and potential risks for long-term performance.
However, the tests can be extended over two days using water-level loggers. If pits are left open overnight
with water in them, then health and safety issues need to be addressed and as a minimum the areas will
need to be securely fenced off.
The results of incomplete tests should not be extrapolated to obtain design values of infiltration rates. The
head of water in the infiltration test should fall to less than 25 of the initial head of water. If this does not
occur, the results should state that the infiltration rate cannot be determined. If other variations to the test
method in Bettess (1996) are required, the test results sheet should clearly state what variations have
been made to the test and why.
It is rare that sufficient tests are carried out on a site to allow statistical analysis. The worse-case
infiltration rate value should be used (not the mean or any other value) unless a sound justification for
doing otherwise is demonstrated.
Infiltration test results should always be provided together with trial pit records that include soil/rock
descriptions of the materials in which the test has been completed in accordance with BS EN ISO 16-
12002 or BS EN ISO 169-1200. The interpretation of the test results should be compared to the soil
descriptions and any unusually high or low values assessed against the conceptual site ground model,
and then confirmation should be provided that the measured infiltration rates are representative of the
wider ground mass (eg the test has not been undertaken in a limited extent of sand within a mass of clay).
The likely impact of water on the soil and the long-term infiltration rate should also be assessed.
The infiltration tests should be carried out at the location, depth and head of water that replicates the
proposed design. For larger systems, the tests should provide sufficient coverage across the entire area
to be occupied by the infiltration system. The test results sheet should state which stratum the results
are appropriate to and any limitations in the test for example, has the infiltration rate been estimated by
assuming water only infiltrates into one particular stratum, such as a discrete layer of limestone
25.4 THE IMPACTS OF SILTATION ON INFILTRATION SYSTEM PERFORMANCE
The soil surrounding an infiltration system can become blinded through ingress of silt, and the infiltration
capacity reduced as a result. All infiltration system designs should therefore include appropriate pre-
treatment (ie silt/sediment removal systems). Larger systems should also be monitored to check the
extent or effects of long-term silt deposition if thought necessary for example, by providing a monitoring
well within the infiltration system that can be used to monitor the drop in water level after a rainfall event,
or by providing access for visual inspection. Some blinding can be simply removed if there is access to
the infiltration surface, but in other cases (eg deep soakaways) blinding can render the system useless
over time. Even with upstream sediment protection it is likely that some silt will always collect in an
infiltration device. The risk posed by silt depends on the relative difference in permeability between the
silt and the surrounding soil, and on the design method used.
If the surrounding soil has similar permeability to the silt then there will be little effect. Also, if the design
is based on the guidance in BRE (1991) then infiltration from the base is ignored and so any silt will also
have negligible effect on infiltration rates (Figure 25.6).

Figure 25.6 Effect of silt on performance of infiltration
There are many thousands of soakaways in the UK that have been working for over thirty years with no
maintenance. This is probably because, in many cases, the infiltration capacity of the soil is relatively
low in comparison with the accumulated silt, and so the reduction in capacity is marginal (Wilson and
DeRosa, 2006).
The effects of siltation will be more noticeable when the infiltration rate of the soil is high in relation to
that of the silt. Based on typical quoted gradings for silt, it is likely to have a permeability of around 1
106 m/s and, since many soakaways are designed using infiltration rates of around 1 105 to 1 106
m/s, the effects of the silt will be low. This points to the fact that care should be taken when assuming
infiltration rates for design that are greater than 1 105 m/s, because, above this, the impact of silt on
performance becomes more significant, especially where infiltration from the bottom of a systems is
assumed (ie the design method in Bettess, 1996).
25.5 REUSE OF EXISTING SOAKAWAYS
Where sites are being redeveloped or extended, it may be possible to reuse existing soakaways. An
approach for testing and assessing the capacity of existing soakaways is described by Chen et al (200).
This method can be used to measure the performance and capacity of existing systems and examine
whether the systems are suitable for reuse when design and construction details of the system are
not available. Requirements for field observations and a procedure for a modified soil infiltration
test performed within the system are proposed. The system’s working condition is measured by a
performance indicator related to the time taken to empty the soakaway. This is then employed to evaluate
the potential reuse capacity of the system.
SS D DS
In most circumstances, the area over which infiltration is proposed will be considerably smaller than the
impermeable area being drained. Except for the most permeable of soils, the inflow rate to the infiltration
system will exceed the outflow rate (the product of the infiltration coefficient of the soil and the infiltration area).
It is therefore necessary to store the water on site or in the infiltration unit to allow time for it to soak away.
Provision of sufficient storage capacity is essential for an infiltration system to meet the design standard
of service. The purpose of hydraulic design is to select dimensions for the system that are sufficient to
store and infiltrate the runoff from the design storm. Overflows or additional discharge points should
be provided, if total infiltration cannot be relied on for all return period events, and exceedance flow
management should always be considered (Section 24.12).
Chapter 25 Infiltration design methods

The hydraulic design procedure is set out in Figure 25.7.
Figure 25.7 Hydraulic design process
Infiltration devices are commonly designed for return periods up to 1100 year, plus an allowance for
climate change. Advice on suitable return periods for specific components is provided in the relevant
technical component chapters.
One of the largest uncertainties in the design of infiltration systems is the infiltration coefficient, as
this may reduce over time, particularly if effective pre-treatment is not included within the design, and/
or system maintenance is poor. To account for this, a factor of safety is introduced into the design
procedure that reduces the observed value of the infiltration coefficient. The factor used depends upon
the consequences of failure and engineering judgement is therefore required as to the factor to be
used. Factors are suggested in Table 25.2. It should be noted that the figures are not based on actual
observations of performance loss.
The following sections describe the calculation methods for infiltration system siing.

For sloping-sided structures, there is no simple analytical method for calculating the maximum water
depth. A numerical procedure for calculating the depth is given in Bettess (1996). It is recommended that
sloping-sided structures are approximated by a vertical-sided structure or that the method described in
that publication is used.
25.7 EMPTYING TIME CHECKS
The hydraulic equations in Section 25.6 take both storage and infiltration into account and, if the
infiltration rate is low, will ensure that the system incorporates sufficient storage. However, if infiltration is
too low, there is the possibility that the system will not have emptied before the next rainfall event starts.
The infiltration component should discharge from full to half-full within a reasonable time so that the risk of
it not being able to manage a subsequent rainfall event is minimised. Where components are designed to
manage the 110 year or 10 year event, it is usual to specify that half emptying occurs within 2 hours. If
components are designed to infiltrate events greater than the 10 year event, designing to half empty in 2
hours can result in very large storage requirements and, with agreement from the drainage approving body,
it may be appropriate to allow longer half emptying times. This decision should be based on an assessment
of the performance of the system and the consequences of consecutive rainfall events occurring.
Where emptying times are found to be too long, extra storage may be required (see Equation 25.6).

management: design
methods
This chapter provides guidance on the methods that should be used to design
SuDS to meet the water quality design criteria and good practice design
standards. This includes: the types of contaminants found in urban runoff;
the treatment processes within SuDS components and the performance of
different types of SuDS components; methods for evaluating the pollution
hazard from different types of land use and the level of treatment required;
designing a treatment system using the SuDS Management Train approach.
Water quality design criteria are set out in Chapter 4.
Guidance on component sizing for water quantity and water quality management is
provided in Chapters 11–23.
Chapter 24 provides guidance on sizing storage and conveyance systems to deliver
the water quantity design criteria.
hapter includes further guidance on the suitability of using infiltration to dispose
of surface water runoff.
26.1 INTRODUCTION
Managing the quality of surface water runoff so that receiving surface waters and/or
groundwater are protected is strongly linked to the hydraulic control of runoff. For the
majority of cases, with well-designed SuDS, treatment and pollution removal can be
delivered cost-effectively hand in hand with conveyance, attenuation and infiltration,
particularly within vegetated surface-based systems.
Any SuDS component should be designed according to the guidance set out in
the technical component chapters of this manual (Chapters 11–23), to ensure that
treatment processes are effective.
26.2 PROTECTING SURFACE WATERS
Wherever possible, when discharging runoff from the site to surface waters, SuDS should
be designed to intercept (ie prevent) runoff (and the associated pollutants) for most rainfall
events up to approximately 5 mm in depth (see water quality standard 1 in Chapter 4).
When runoff does occur, treatment within SuDS components is essential for frequent rainfall
events, for example up to about a 1:1 year return period event, where urban contaminants
are being mobilised and washed off urban surfaces, and the aggregated contribution to the
total pollutant load to the receiving surface water body is potentially high.
For rainfall events greater than approximately the 1:1 year event, it is likely that the
dilution available in receiving surface waters will be significant, and environmental risks
will be reduced, which means that SuDS treatment processes become less crucial. It
may, therefore, be efficient to spill higher flow events from the main on-line treatment
components into larger off-line conveyance and attenuation systems.

CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
It is important that the SuDS design seeks to minimise the risk of remobilisation and washout of any
pollutants that have been captured by the system during events larger than those for which the treatment
system has been designed.
26.3 PROTECTING GROUNDWATER
The requirement for groundwater pollution risk management varies in different countries of the UK owing
to different environmental regulators.
In England and Wales, the requirement for groundwater pollution risk management needs to be
considered for all scales of runoff event, that is, for both:
Interception of runoff (ie storing runoff in the upper soil layers of SuDS components from where
small amounts of water may infiltrate, but where the component is designed as a storage or
conveyance system rather than an infiltration system), and
infiltrating significant volumes of runoff into the ground.
Advice on groundwater protection for England and Wales is provided in GP3 (Environment Agency, 2013).
In Scotland and Northern Ireland, groundwater pollution risk management is only required for SuDS
components designed specifically for infiltration (eg soakaways, infiltration trenches or infiltration basins).
Advice on groundwater protection for Scotland and Northern Ireland is set out in SEPA (2009) and EHS
(2001) respectively.
At the time of writing, the way in which Northern Ireland’s groundwater protection policy is applied and
integrated into SuDS policy development is under consideration, and the guidance in this manual should
therefore be considered interim, until Northern Ireland specific policy is available.
The risk posed by surface water runoff to groundwater is often low because of the protection afforded by
the layers of unsaturated soils that lie between the infiltration surface and the groundwater receptor. The
effectiveness of the protection will depend on:
the depth of the groundwater: a greater depth of unsaturated soil will tend to provide greater
protection
the predominant flow type, that is whether the flow occurs between soil grains (intergranular flow) or
through larger channels (fracture flow) intergranular flow will tend to provide greater protection
the soil characteristics those with significant clay mineral and organic content have been
demonstrated to offer increased potential for beneficial contaminant attenuation similarly soil pH
affects the mobility of contaminants, low pH soils being generally associated with more mobile
contaminants.
The risk will also be dependent on:
the runoff pollutants, their concentrations and how readily they can be degraded
the volume of water infiltrated into the ground
the length of time over which contaminants accumulate.
These factors will dictate the loading of contaminants on the soil, the rate of build-up, the capacity of the
soil to retain pollutants and the point at which pollutants are likely to migrate to the groundwater.
Where the risks to groundwater are considered to be unacceptable, upstream (lined) SuDS components
can often be used to reduce pollutant levels. If the risk is still considered unacceptable, infiltration should
be prevented.

26.4 THE LEVEL OF POLLUTION IN SURFACE WATER RUNOFF
Evidence showing the extent to which surface water runoff is likely to be contaminated is summarised
in Annex 1 – presented as a series of tables for selected pollutants. The tables include relevant
environmental standards in an attempt to evaluate the likely significance of the measured pollutant
concentrations (EA, 2014).
Although there is significant variability in the data presented, the data (particularly that from the UK)
shows that surface water runoff from urban areas is polluted and demonstrates the potential need for
pollutant levels to be reduced in order to meet environmentally acceptable levels.
26.5 TREATMENT PROCESSES WITHIN SUDS
There are a range of water quality treatment processes that can be exploited within the design of
a sustainable drainage system for example, sedimentation, filtration and biofiltration, separation,
adsorption, biodegradation, volatilisation, precipitation, hydrolysis, oxidation, reduction and substitution,
plant uptake and photolysis. These are presented in Annex 2.
Treatment effectiveness is strongly linked to the hydraulic control of runoff, in particular:
velocity control: sediment deposition, filtration and other removal processes occurring at low flow
velocities during regular rainfall events (ie through the control of velocities in SuDS components
during frequent events, such as up to approximately the 1:1 year return period event)
retention time: the removal of contaminants through settling, adsorption and other removal
processes occurring (for events up to approximately the 1:1 year return period) over the period of
time that the runoff is in contact with SuDS treatment media (eg the surface of a swale, the filtration
media within a bioretention system) or held within a permanent water storage volume (eg pond).
It is also heavily dependent on the characteristics of any media through which the runoff filters.
26.6 EVIDENCE RELATING TO MANAGING WATER QUALITY RISKS
26.6.1 The capability of SuDS to reduce pollution levels
A relatively small number of monitoring studies of SuDS performance have been undertaken in the UK,
but those that do exist confirm the benefit of SuDS in reducing levels of contamination in surface water
runoff (Royal Haskoning, 2012, Woods Ballard et al, 2005, Jefferies, 2004, Jefferies and Napier, 2008,
and Jefferies et al, 2008).
Further guidance can be found at http://sudsnet.abertay.ac.uk/downloads.htm
The limited number of studies together with the lack of a consistent monitoring specification between
studies mean that these datasets cannot be used alone to derive generic performance levels of different
SuDS components. However, the stormwater BMP database <www.bmpdatabase.org> developed
in the USA has grown to over 530 monitoring sites and has resulted in improved understanding of
component performance in reducing contaminant concentrations to levels that should not pose a risk
to the receiving environment (Leisenring et al, 2014). Recently, the project has also been extended
to analyse performance of “manufactured devices”. This concluded that performance levels can be
comparable with vegetated components, but that manufactured devices only remove the pollutants for
which they are designed, for their specified range of design flows. For example, sediment and particulate-
bound pollutants may be removed by sedimentation, but dissolved constituents may require adsorptive
filtration or some type of biochemical process to be removed effectively. It should be noted that SuDS
performance is generally observed in terms of inflow and outflow concentrations of surface flows, rather
than concentrations in underlying soil moisture or groundwater.
Chapter 26: Water quality management
Chapter 26: Water quality management
563

CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Table 26.13, Annex 1 summarises the data and includes a comparison with relevant water quality
standards. It is recognised that the climatic conditions in the USA may result in different performance
levels from the UK. However, in the absence of more robust data in the UK, the BMP database provides
a useful indication of the range of outflow concentrations that may be achievable from a range of different
components (confirming the capability of SuDS to reduce concentrations to more environmentally
acceptable levels) and the potential variation between component types.
Key generic findings with respect to the removal of TSS and metals are summarised in Box 26.1.
BOX
26.1

Total suspended solids
In general, sediment removal tends to improve as hydraulic residence time increases. This can be
increased in ponds, wetlands and basins by increasing flow path lengths. In filters and bioretention
system, increasing bed thickness and evenly distributing flow would improve performance. For
infiltration components, maintenance is critical to prevent clogging from sediment build-up.
Designing to minimise scour and resuspension of deposited sediment is important, along with
ensuring appropriate long-term maintenance to remove accumulated sediments.
Metals
Treatment effectiveness will depend on the specific metal and its characteristics at the site. A
combination of treatment processes (using a Management Train approach) is therefore generally
more effective to deal with a spectrum of heavy metals. This will usually involve sedimentation
processes (typically effective in removing particulates and associated particulate-bound pollutants
down to approximately 10 m if well designed) followed by filtration processes (eg bioretention) for
finer particles. The removal of dissolved metals depends on the metal form and on the composition
of the sorption or ion-exchange medium.
The BMP database does not include any data on hydrocarbon or PAH removal. However, work by
Jefferies and Napier (2008) and Jefferies et al (2008) concluded that it is better to control oils and PAHs
in soil-based SuDS at locations that are periodically wet and dry, such as in the base of detention basins,
filter strips, swales, bioretention systems or infiltration basins. The pollutants, once removed from the
runoff, will break down much more readily into harmless compounds in components where they are
retained on the surface rather than under water in a pond or wetland.
Nutrient (normally represented by total nitrogen and phosphorous) removal can be important, particularly for
nitrate- or phosphate-sensitive receiving water bodies and water bodies with high amenity value. Temporary
saturated storage or slow conveyance zones, such as within bioretention systems (Chapter 18) or wetlands
(Chapter 23) can reduce nutrient levels. Street sweeping has also been demonstrated to be an effective
pollution prevention measure for nutrient control through removal of nutrient sources (Chapter 27).
The properties of pathogens such as E.coli and Enterrococci (usually present where there are
misconnections from foul sewers or animal faeces) make their removal in natural treatment facilities difficult,
although SuDS components do tend to reduce bacteria counts where they are associated with solids.
26.6.2 SuDS performance variability
The BMP database research outputs (WERF, 2014), the research undertaken by Jefferies (2004)
and other research findings (including Ellis et al, 2012) all conclude that different components (with
individual integral unit treatment processes) exhibit different capacities for removal of specific pollutants
or pollutant groups.
However, the performance of any SuDS component is also inherently variable and pollutant removal
effectiveness depends on a wide range of variables including (among others):
the concentration of the inflow (eg efficiencies tend to be higher with higher inflow concentrations)
the climate and time of year (eg temperature and vegetation growth can influence treatment processes)
564 Part E: Supporting guidance
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
the condition of the component (eg recent maintenance activities and prior frequency of maintenance
could influence removal rates)
the design characteristics of the particular component (eg slopes, flow paths, retention times)
the rainfall intensity and duration of any particular event (which will influence flow velocities, scour rates etc).
26.6.3 Groundwater protection
The conclusions of two studies into the extent to which surface water runoff may pose a risk to
groundwater are presented in Annex 4. Overall conclusions can be summarised as follows:
The overall risk to groundwater through porous media from the key contaminants associated with
highway runoff is low.
The presence of organic matter within the topsoil and underlying soils of surface-based infiltration
systems, along with the opportunity for microbial mediated degradation of the PAH and TPH content
of highway runoff through a sufficient depth of unsaturated one, provides a significant degree of
protection of underlying groundwater.
The vast majority of heavy metals, PAHs and TPHs are retained in the top 10 cm of soil. An overlying
vegetative layer will further reduce the risk of their movement to groundwater.
Repeated delivery of contaminant mass over an extended period of time to an area (or volume) of
unsaturated zone will eventually lead to the sorption properties of the material being exhausted.
Ultimately, in the case of conservative pollutants such as metals, the soil column under the
infiltration area will become saturated and breakthrough to groundwater will occur. The surface
area and geometry of the infiltration system are therefore important for reducing risks, together
with appropriate monitoring and maintenance programmes. Research presented in Scott Wilson
(2010) suggests that, for typical highway loadings, cadmium (as an example) took between 54 and
714 years to move through 1 m of different types of unsaturated aquifer material. It is therefore
considered unlikely that soil removal and component rehabilitation would be required during the
design life of the system for lower hazard sites.
Source control measures such as grass filter strips, swales and detention areas should be priority
features of SuDS networks serving urbanised networks and highways, where oil contamination may
be significant (Jefferies and Napier, 200, and Jefferies et al, 2008).
26.7 METHODS FOR MANAGING POLLUTION RISKS
The risk posed by surface water runoff to the receiving environment is a function of:
the pollution hazard at a particular site (ie the pollutant source)
the effectiveness of SuDS treatment components in reducing levels of pollutants to environmentally
acceptable levels, and/or the effectiveness of underlying soil layers in protecting the receiving
groundwater (ie the pollutant pathway)
the sensitivity of the receiving environment (ie the environmental receptor).
Land use is the primary influencing factor in the quality of urban surface water runoff (Royal Haskoning,
2010) and can therefore be used to represent the likely significance of the expected pollutant
concentrations and loadings generated during rainfall events (ie the pollution hazard posed by the site).
Determining the hazard posed by the land use activities at a site and the extent to which underlying soil layers
and/or proposed treatment components reduce the associated risk can be done using a variety of methods
that vary in complexity and data requirements. The different generic methods can be summarised as:
simple qualitative methods (using indices of likely pollution levels and SuDS performance capacities)
established risk screening methods

process-based treatment modelling methods (which, where used, are likely to form part of a detailed
risk assessment).

Table 4.3 (Chapter 4) sets out which of these methods is required – for different generic land use types
and receiving waters. Process-based modelling is not currently readily available for SuDS design in the
UK, and is not therefore specified as a requirement. However, where robust models can be developed by
designers, this approach should not be discounted as a future option for SuDS design.
It is important to ensure that risks to both surface and groundwater are managed effectively, and the
approach taken should be agreed with the drainage approving body and/or environmental regulator in
advance of the design, as local differences in requirements may exist.
Approaches that consider a number of key pollutant types are recommended because:
receiving water quality standards tend to be specified in terms of individual pollutant thresholds
(Section 26.4)
different components tend to have different capacities to remove different types of pollutants
(Section 26.6)
any component (proprietary product or otherwise) will need to demonstrate performance across
a range of pollutants, or where this is not possible, different types of component will be needed to
remove different pollutants. A series of sediment removal components, such as gulley pots, would be
unlikely to meet the performance requirements for the full suite of pollutants.
26.7.1 Simple index approach
The simple method described in this section, and summarised in Box 26.2, has been developed from that
set out in Ellis et al (2012), a summary of which is presented in Annex 5.
566 Part E: Supporting guidance
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
The method is guided by the land use and SuDS performance evidence (Section 26.6). However,
the variations in the approaches and data collected between studies, the wide ranges in pollution
concentrations involved (pre and post treatment) and the paucity of UK data all mean that the evidence
has had to be supplemented with theoretical understanding regarding the processes likely to deliver
higher levels of removal of specific contaminants. The method has then been applied to a range of
development scenarios to check that they deliver appropriate outputs.
If the indices are not considered to be appropriate – either for the land use or for the proposed mitigation,
then the designer can either use alternative measures of hazard and risk mitigation, using a bespoke risk
assessment process (Section 26.7.3), or justify alternative indices using similar evidence and/or process
understanding to that discussed in this chapter and presented in Annexes 1–5.
BOX
26.2
Steps of the simple index approach
Step 1 – Allocate suitable pollution hazard indices for the proposed land use
Step 2 – Select SuDS with a total pollution mitigation index that equals or exceeds the pollution
hazard index
Step 3 – Where the discharge is to protected1 surface waters or groundwater, consider the need for
a more precautionary approach
Note:
1 Designated as those protected for the supply of drinking water (Table 4.3).
Ste Define oution haard indies
Pollution hazard indices are presented in Table 26.2 for the same range of land use categories used in
Table 4.3 (water quality standard 2, Chapter 4).
The indices range from 0 (no pollution hazard for this contaminant type) to 1 (high pollution hazard for this
contaminant type).
Step 2 Determine SuDS pollution mitigation indices
To deliver adequate treatment, the selected SuDS components should have a total pollution mitigation index
(for each contaminant type) that equals or exceeds the pollution hazard index (for each contaminant type):
otal SuDS mitiation ine ollution aar ine
(for each contaminant type) (for each contaminant type)
Where the only destination of the runoff is to a surface water that is there is no infiltration from the
SuDS to groundwater – the surface water indices should be used, as suggested in Table 26.3.
In England and Wales, where the principal destination of the runoff is to a surface water, but small
amounts of infiltration may occur from unlined components (Interception), then the groundwater indices
should be used for the discharge to groundwater (as suggested in Table 26.4), and the surface water
indices should be used for the main surface water discharge (as suggested in Table 26.3). In Scotland
and Northern Ireland, groundwater risk management is not a requirement for this scenario.
Where the principal destination of the runoff is to groundwater, but discharges to surface waters may
occur once the infiltration capacity is exceeded, the groundwater indices should be used, as suggested in
Table 26.4. The risk to surface waters will be low, as dilution will be high for large events, so treatment is
not required.

2 These should only be used if considered appropriate as part of a detailed risk assessment – required for all these land use types
(Table .). When dealing with high haard sites, the environmental regulator should first be consulted for pre-permitting advice.
This will help determine the most appropriate approach to the development of a design solution.
Where a site land use falls outside the defined categories, the indices should be adapted (and agreed with the drainage approving
body) or else the more detailed risk assessment method should be adopted.
Where nutrient or bacteria and pathogen removal is important for a particular receiving water, equivalent indices should be developed
for these pollutants (if acceptable to the drainage approving body) or the risk assessment method adopted.
Where the mitigation index of an individual component is insufficient, two components (or more) in series
will be required, where:
Total SuDS mitigation index = mitigation index1 + 0.5 (mitigation index2)
Where:
mitigation Indexn = mitigation index for component n
A factor of 0.5 is used to account for the reduced performance of secondary or tertiary components
associated with already reduced inflow concentrations.

These must demonstrate that they can address each of the contaminant types to

Notes
1 SuDS components only deliver these indices if they follow design guidance with respect to hydraulics and treatment set out in the
relevant technical component chapters.
2 Filter drains can remove coarse sediments, but their use for this purpose will have significant implications with respect to
maintenance requirements, and this should be taken into account in the design and Maintenance Plan.
Ponds and wetlands can remove coarse sediments, but their use for this purpose will have significant implications with respect
to the maintenance requirements and amenity value of the system. Sediment should normally be removed upstream, unless they
are specifically designed to retain sediment in a separate part of the component, where it cannot easily migrate to the main body
of water.
Where a wetland is not specifically designed to provide significantly enhanced treatment, it should be considered as having the
same mitigation indices as a pond.

practice is currently under development that will allow manufacturers to complete an agreed test protocol for systems intended to
treat contaminated surface water runoff. Full details can be found at: http://tinyurl.com/qf7yuj7

component are not practicable. Proprietary treatment systems may also be considered appropriate for existing sites that are
causing pollution where there is a requirement to retrofit treatment. SEPA (201) also provides a flowchart with a summary of
checks on suitability of a proprietary system.

maximum likely groundwater level (as required in infiltration design Chapter 25).

3 Alternative depths may be considered where it can be demonstrated that the combination of the proposed depth and soil
characteristics will provide equivalent protection to the underlying groundwater – see note 1.
If significant volumes of sediment are allowed to enter an infiltration system, there will be a high risk of rapid clogging and
subsequent system failure.

practice is currently under development that will allow manufacturers to complete an agreed test protocol for systems intended to treat
contaminated surface water runoff. Full details can be found at: www.britishwater.co.uk/Publications/codes-of-practise.aspx
6 SEPA only considers proprietary treatment systems as appropriate in exceptional circumstances where other types of SuDS
component are not practicable. Proprietary treatment systems may also be considered appropriate for existing sites that are
causing pollution, where there is a requirement to retrofit treatment. WAT-RM-0 (SEPA, 201) also provides a flowchart with a
summary of checks on suitability of a proprietary system.
The following should be noted:
Where the indices are not considered representative by the designer, a risk assessment can be
undertaken (Section 26.7.3).
Components should always be designed for treatment, as described in the design guidance set out
in the individual component chapters. If they are undersized, incorrectly designed or constructed or
inadequately maintained, their treatment performance could be significantly affected. Component
checklists (Appendix B) can be used to confirm design and construction adequacy and set
appropriate maintenance regimes.
Where the infiltration component itself does not provide sufficient pollution mitigation, the design
should include upstream SuDS components that are lined to prevent infiltration from occurring. The
mitigation indices set out in Table 26.3 (for discharges to surface water) should be used for any
upstream treatment.
570 Part E: Supporting guidance
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Step 3 Consider the need for a precautionary approach where discharges are to protected waters
In England and Wales, reference to local planning documents should also be made to identify any
additional protection required for sites due to habitat conservation (Chapter 7). The implications of
developments on, or in close proximity to, an area with an environmental designation, such as a site of
special scientific interest (SSSI), should be considered via consultation with relevant conservation bodies
such as Natural England.
In England and Wales, where the discharge is to protected surface waters or groundwater, an additional
treatment component (ie over and above that required for standard discharges), or other equivalent
protection, is required that provides environmental protection in the event of an unexpected pollution
event or poor system performance. Protected surface waters are those designated for drinking water
abstraction. In England and Wales, protected groundwater resources are defined as Source Protection
Zone 1. In Northern Ireland, a more precautionary approach may be required, and this should be checked
with the environmental regulator on a site-by-site basis.
26.7.2 Groundwater risk screening
A risk screening approach is required by the environmental regulators in England and Wales for medium
hazard sites (Table 4.3). In Northern Ireland, the environmental regulator should be consulted to
determine whether a risk screening approach is required.
The approach allows assessment of scenarios where the infiltration of water from surface runoff may
require detailed risk assessment. The risk matrix used in HA (2009b), as updated by Scott Wilson (2010),
provides a method for assessing the acceptability of Interception and infiltration SuDS components at a
site. The matrix is based on the understanding that the risk posed by the runoff is a function of:
the likely contamination hazard posed by the land use
the amount of water likely to be infiltrated
the attenuation potential of the soil or unsaturated zone for reducing the risk associated with
pollutants present in highway runoff that may pose a risk to groundwater.
The matrix from HA (2009b) has been slightly modified here to make it more relevant for general SuDS
applications and is presented in Table 26.5. The method requires each risk element (RE) (numbered 1–8
in column 1 and described in column 2) to be assigned a risk score (RS). The risk score will either be low
(a score of 1), medium (a score of 2) or high (a score of 3) depending on the site characteristics described
in columns 3–5 of the same table. For each risk element (RE), the risk score (RS) is then multiplied by the
weighting factor (WF) given in column 6.
The risk scores for each risk element are then added together to give a total risk score for the SuDS
component:
Interpretation of the total outcome score is provided in Table 26.6, which guides the designer on the likely
acceptability of different design solutions, and appropriate subsequent actions to take.
Where relevant data is not available to the designers, the likely worst-case characteristics should be
assumed until suitable investigations have been undertaken.

26.7.3 Detailed risk assessment
There are situations where a risk assessment method is either required (as defined in water quality
standard 2, Table 4.3) or chosen by the designer and/or SuDS approving body as best meeting the needs
for designing the appropriate treatment system for the site.
The scale of any risk assessment should be appropriate to the scale of the risk posed by the site: the
significance of the potential pollution haard combined with the sensitivity of the receiving water body. In
the situations where the development proposal is heavily influenced by highway traffic in excess of 15,000
AADT, and is not associated with other pollutant sources, an assessment methodology as described in
Annex I, Method C of HA (2009b). HA (2009b) or equivalent local authority guidance can be followed and
may be required by the drainage approving body. Some guidance on risk assessment for surface water
discharges to surface water bodies is set out (for England and Wales) in EA (2014) and (for Scotland) in
SEPA (2014). Guidance on risk assessment for discharges of surface water to groundwater is set out (for
England and Wales) in EA (2013), for Scotland in SEPA (2009) and for Northern Ireland in EHS (2001).
At the time of writing, the way in which Northern Ireland’s groundwater protection policy is applied and
integrated into SuDS policy development is under consideration, and the guidance in this manual should
therefore be considered interim until Northern Ireland specific policy is available.
The risk assessment for each outfall or discharge point should:
a) determine and justify the range and likely significance and levels of pollutant(s) that may be washed
off the site
b) state the baseline environmental quality, any environmental designations and relevant environmental
standards (eg EQSs)
c) in the event of multiple surface water discharges from the same development, take account of any
increased risk to the catchment from the cumulative impact of several outfalls
d) determine the scale of the potential risk to groundwater through taking account of the scale of the
discharge, the depth of the discharge, the vulnerability of the groundwater body (eg soil and aquifer
properties and seasonal variation in depth to water table)
e) determine and justify the effectiveness of the proposed drainage system and/or the unsaturated
soil and aquifer layers in reducing the levels of pollutants to acceptable levels, taking account of the
inherent uncertainty
f) summarise the residual risk to the receiving environment
g) use supporting data from site investigations
h) meet the requirements of the appropriate drainage approving body and/or environmental regulator.

CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
The risk screening approach set out in Section 26.7.2 may be used as an initial stage in any groundwater
risk assessment. The evidence presented in Annex 4 may also be used where appropriate.
Where compound substances (eg oils) are considered a risk, it is good practice to take a risk indicator
(such as benzene) and use that to determine potential impacts within any risk assessment. Benzene
has both an ES and a drinking water standard (DWS). There may also be specific British Standards of
relevance eg BS EN 858-1:2002.
26.7.4 Process-based treatment modelling
One way of demonstrating the likely performance of a SuDS component or series of components in
reducing pollutant loadings to the receiving water body is to use a long rainfall time series as input to a
process-based surface or groundwater model that represents:
1 the pollutant build-up and wash-off processes and the resulting statistical distributions of the likely
pollutant loadings entering the SuDS
2 the treatment processes provided by individual and combined SuDS units and/or the soil and aquifer
layers between the infiltration surface and the groundwater
3 the impact of climate (including antecedent conditions, soil saturation levels, vegetation state etc).
In this way, a representative picture of the annual load discharged from the system and its variability can
be developed and considered for compliance with receiving water body standards (these would need to be
set by the local environmental regulator). Such approaches have been adopted in Australia and across the
USA, but datasets to calibrate such models are currently sparse in the UK, and experience with their use is
limited. However, in the interest of promoting research and scientific development in this area, this approach
should not be precluded, and it is included here for completeness and to demonstrate its future potential.
Where designers wish to use a modelling approach, this should be agreed with the approving body and
environmental regulator in advance of the design.
26.8 DESIGNING A TREATMENT SYSTEM USING A SUDS MANAGEMENT TRAIN
A number of SuDS components in series (a Management Train) through a development site facilitates
the capture, conveyance and storage of surface water runoff while delivering Interception and pollution
risk management. The range of SuDS components available provides flexibility to designers to integrate
surface water management with urban design and to meet water quantity, amenity and biodiversity
design criteria in a range of different ways.
A SuDS Management Train is a robust pollutant removal strategy. Using a number of different SuDS
components in series will help target a good range of particulate-bound and dissolved pollutants, will
deliver gradual improvement in water quality and will act as a buffer for accidental spills and intermittent
high pollutant loads. The suitability of different SuDS components within the Management Train is
indicated in Table 26.7 . A single SuDS component (eg a bioretention system) which has a high capacity
for the removal of pollutants, may be suitable in some scenarios – provided its functionality is protected
from sediment build-up and it can deliver the required hydraulic criteria for the contributing catchment.
The Management Train can be adapted or extended to deliver appropriate levels of risk management,
depending on the land use and sensitivity of the receiving water body (Table 4.3). Where there are
several different land use surfaces on a site, the design should take account of the fact that some areas
will potentially need more treatment than others. Where ownership of the site is split (eg a number of
industrial units), the design should ensure that adequate treatment is delivered on each plot, so that
responsibility for any pollution and associated remedial maintenance from the plot can reside with the plot
owner. Pollution prevention strategies may also form part of the risk management approach for industrial
sites.

2 for roof runoff only
Interception design may be possible in certain scenarios, but would require detailed justification
4 if unlined and design performance can be demonstrated (noting the need to protect groundwater)
5 where design performance can be demonstrated
The following guidance should be followed in the development of a robust treatment design for the site:
1 Each component should be designed and constructed to meet the design requirements set
out in the individual technical component chapters (Chapters 11–23).
In common with any operational system, long-term maintenance is required in order to maintain their
future treatment functionality.
2 Sediment should be removed as far upstream in the drainage system as possible.
Sediment control components that are located close to the runoff surface allow sediment build-up to
occur gradually in dry features and at shallow depths, facilitating the breakdown and degradation of the
organic particulates and straightforward and cost-effective sediment removal. Sediment trapping provides
important removal of a range of contaminants that are adsorbed onto sediment surfaces and upstream
sediment controls protect downstream components from damage or poor performance due to sediment
build-up either on the surface or within subsurface media or soils. This is particularly important for
infiltration systems.
3 Pollution control and treatment should be implemented at a plot level for individually owned
or operated plots, with open downstream conveyance systems where practicable, so that
any residual contamination is obvious and can be sourced.
Pollution risks should be made the responsibility of the site owner/operator.

ANNEX 1
Contaminants in urban runoff and their
potential toxicity
There are few monitoring studies of direct urban runoff in the UK. However, there is a UK database of
water quality data from water bodies in small urban catchments (Mitchell, 2005) a few UK studies of
SuDS performance where urban runoff data has been monitored as the inflow (eg Woods Ballard et al,
2005, Royal Haskoning, 2012, Jefferies, 200) the International BMP stormwater database (WERF, 201),
which has collated data from over 50 studies primarily across the US and urban runoff data held within
guidance documents such as DEP (2006) and OMOE (2003).
The Mitchell (2005) dataset is based on UK data, supplemented with northern European data to make the
results more statistically robust. Measured pollutant concentrations in surface water runoff for different land
uses for total suspended solids, cadmium, copper, zinc and nickel are presented in Tables 26.8 to 26.12.
These pollutants have been selected as they are known to be prevalent in surface water runoff at levels
that may be toxic in either acute or chronic exposure scenarios (and because the data is available).
In order to provide a comparison, summary data from the USA stormwater BMP database (Leisenring
et al, 2014) is also provided. The BMP database provides data from studies looking at different types of
SuDS components (rather than different land uses). Therefore, only the average concentrations across all
studies are presented here.
WRc (2008) also presents data of suggested average surface water runoff concentrations from trunk
roads and motorways. This data is likely to contain higher pollutant concentrations than required to be
managed by SuDS in general development scenarios.
The tables then go on to compare concentrations of pollutants measured in surface water runoff with
relevant environmental standards in an attempt to determine their likely significance (EA, 201). Although
there is significant variability in the data presented, they show the degree to which surface water runoff
from development is polluted and the need for this to be addressed in order to meet environmental
standards.
EA (2014) guidance on assessment of hazardous pollutants within surface water discharges provides
some direction on appropriate methods to determine the acceptability of pollutants discharged in surface
water runoff. Although the principal methods described in the document are applicable to continuous
discharges and variable process discharges, the guidance suggests that for rainfall dependent
discharges and non-continuous discharges (pertinent to SuDS), it is appropriate to compare likely runoff
concentrations to environmental standards of receiving water bodies.

Oil and grease levels measured in urban catchments in the UK are 2–5 mg/l for residential areas, 5–25
mg/l for general urban areas (including commercial and industrial sites) and of the order of 200 mg/l
for main roads (Mitchell, 2005). There are no specified ESs for these substances, but their presence
is usually visible and unsightly, so maximum removal is appropriate. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
(PAHs) have specified ESs, but their concentrations in surface water runoff have not been monitored
in the datasets referred to above. Average event mean concentrations (EMCs) of fluoranthene are
given by WRc (2008) for trunk roads as 1.02 µg/l compared to a maximum allowable concentration
EQS of 0.12 µg/l.
Event mean concentration (EMC) – A method for characterising pollutant concentrations in a
receiving water from a runoff event, often chosen for its practicality. The value is determined by
compositing (in proportion to flow rate) a set of samples, taken at various points in time during a
runoff event, into a single sample for analysis.
Total nitrogen levels measured in urban catchments in the UK were at a level of the order of
approximately 5 mg/l for the majority of urban areas, although at only around 1 mg/l for main roads
(Mitchell, 2005).

ANNEX 2
Types of pollutant removal mechanisms
in SuDS
Sedimentation
Sedimentation is one of the primary removal mechanisms in SuDS. Most pollution in runoff is attached to sediment
particles, and so removal of sediment results in a significant reduction in pollutant loads. Sedimentation is achieved
by reducing flow velocities to a level at which the sediment particles fall out of suspension (finer particles requiring
lower velocities) or by encouraging flocculation (which increases particle sie). Very fine particles may remain
in suspension and essentially be characterised as dissolved. Sediment requires periodic removal to permit the
effective functioning of SuDS components. Care also has to be taken in design to minimise the risk of resuspension
when extreme rainfall events occur.
iltration an iofiltration
Pollutants that are conveyed in association with sediment may be filtered from runoff. This may occur through
trapping within the soil or aggregate matrix, on plants or on geotextile layers within the construction. The location
of any filtration will depend on the internal structure of the particular SuDS component. There will generally be a
need to balance removal efficiency with the potential risk of blockage of the filtration component (and associated
maintenance needs of the component, eg filter removal and replacement) although planting can often be used to
help minimise blockage risks and lead to systems that are relatively self-maintaining.
Separation
Many hydrocarbons and some other pollutants (eg pollens) float on the surface of water as a immiscible skin. Such
pollutants can be skimmed off using separation processes, or can be trapped by vegetation, allowing subsequent
degradation, for example by volatilisation and photolysis.
Adsorption
Adsorption occurs when pollutants attach or bind to the surface of sediment, soil, sand, aggregate or artificial
material. The actual process is complex, but tends to be a combination of surface reactions. Change in acidity
of runoff can either increase (higher pH) or decrease (lower pH) the adsorption of pollutants. Similarly, the
winter use of de-icing salts can encourage the release of metals from the surface. Eventually, the materials onto
which pollutants adsorb will become saturated and so this method of treatment will cease to be effective unless
mechanisms for regeneration are available.
Biodegradation
In addition to the physical and chemical processes that may occur on and within a SuDS component, biological
treatment may also occur. Microbial communities are likely to be established within the soil or aggregate matrix,
using the oxygen within the free-draining materials and the nutrients supplied with the inflows, to degrade organic
pollutants such as oils and grease. The level of activity of such bioremediation will be affected by the environmental
conditions such as temperature and the supply of oxygen and nutrients. It also depends on the physical conditions,
such as the suitability of the materials for colonisation.
Ammonia and ammonium ions can be oxidised by bacteria in the ground to form nitrate, which is a highly soluble
form of nitrogen. Nitrate is readily used as a nutrient by plants. In oxygen-limiting conditions, anaerobic bacteria can
facilitate denitrification, in which the participation of several species of bacteria can eventually result in the complete
reduction of nitrate to molecular nitrogen. This is an important process where excessive nitrate production threatens
groundwater quality or eutrophication in surface waters.

Chapter 25 Infiltration design methods 585
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Volatilisation
Volatilisation involves the transfer of a compound from the solid or solution phase to the atmosphere. The
conversion to a gas or vapour is influenced by temperature, reducing pressure, chemical reaction or a combination
of these processes. The rate of volatilisation of a compound is dependent on its vapour pressure, as well as
the characteristics of the surrounding soil. In SuDS systems, volatilisation is primarily concerned with organic
compounds associated with petroleum products and pesticides.
Precipitation
This process is the most common mechanism for removing soluble metals. Precipitation involves chemical
reactions between pollutants and compounds in the soil or aggregate matrix that transform dissolved constituents
into particles of insoluble precipitates. Metals are precipitated as hydroxides, sulphides and carbonates, depending
on which precipitants are present and the pH level. Precipitation can remove most metals (eg arsenic, cadmium,
chromium, copper, iron, lead, mercury, nickel, inc) and many anionic species (eg phosphates, sulphates, fluorides),
although to different levels according to the applied conditions.
Uptake by plants
In ponds and wetlands, uptake by plants (specifically via the biofilm growth around the plant structure) is an
important removal mechanism for nutrients (phosphorous and nitrogen). Metals can also be removed in this
manner, although intermittent maintenance may be required to remove the plants, otherwise there is the possibility
that metals will be returned to the water when the plants die (Chapter 32 Operation and maintenance). Die-back can
also be accompanied by a release of nutrients. Plants also create suitable conditions for deposition of metals, such
as sulphides, in the root zone and also provide a microbiological environment that supports the biodegradation of
organic pollutants.
Photolysis
The breakdown of surface-held organic pollutants by exposure to ultraviolet light.
Hydrolysis
The chemical breakdown of a compound due to reaction with water.
Oxidation
The combination of a compound with oxygen.
Reduction
The loss of oxygen from a compound.
Substitution
The replacement of one functional group in a compound with another.

ANNEX 4
Groundwater protection evidence
Two recent studies in the UK have examined the potential risks posed to groundwater from runoff from
trafficked areas.
Scott Wilson (2010) had the following objectives:
1 to quantify the extent to which contaminants in highway runoff may be leached, degraded or
immobilised in the unsaturated zone and within the soakaway systems
2 to review and/or refine the boundary conditions defined for each risk category within HA (2009a) risk
assessment method
3 to develop an improved groundwater risk methodology for predicting the risk to groundwater from
highway runoff.
This research found the following:
The time taken for contaminants to break through 1 m of different unsaturated aquifer materials
varied. For cadmium (likely to be most rapidly conveyed, break through times ranged from 54 years
(for oolitic limestone aquifer material) to 714 years for oolitic soils.
Residual concentrations of fluoranthene and pyrene were reduced to below the limit of
analytical detection within approximately 0.5 m depth of the unsaturated zone (using assumed
biodegradation rates).
The soil organic matter is extremely important in retaining and attenuating contaminant migration.
The total mass of contaminant is more relevant than the concentration of that contaminant.
The total volume of infiltrating water will be the significant influence on downward flux of the
contaminant through the soil profile.
The overall conclusions of the research are as follows:
The overall risk to groundwater through porous media from the key contaminants associated with highway
runoff is low and the opportunity for microbial mediated degradation of the PAH and TPH content through a
sufficient depth of unsaturated one confers a significant degree of protection to underlying groundwaters.
Organic soil layers will form an important additional barrier to the movement and attenuation of
contamination.
The findings support the view that risks posed by lateral drainage collection components such as swales
will be smaller than for point source infiltration components, and that Interception components, where
infiltration rates are low, will pose a lower risk to groundwater.
The Sniffer project (Jefferies et al, 2008) had the following objectives:

The project conclusions are very similar to those stated in Scott Wilson (2010) and include the following:
1 The risks to groundwater from passing highway drainage onto soil based SuDS is low. There is
evidence of only very low rates of downward movement of contaminants.
2 The vast majority of heavy metals, PAHs and TPHs are retained in the top 10 cm of soil. An overlying
vegetative layer would take up some of the pollutants retained in the soil, further reducing the risk of
their movement to groundwater.

ANNEX 5
Ellis et al, 2012
Middlesex University has undertaken work on the development of a water quality impact assessment
methodology that can be applied to the assessment of SuDS (Ellis et al, 2012) and a summary of the
approach proposed in that paper is described below. It should be noted that this method is not suitable for
use in designing treatment systems for discharges to groundwaters (ie infiltration systems).
Step 1. Pollution index (PI) assessment
The individual pollutant indexing (Table 26.13) has been developed from consideration of the interquartile
range of event mean concentration (EMC) data derived from 71 separate UK studies and referenced against
regulatory EU environmental quality standards. The pollution index is then based on a scaling of the reported
EMC distribution for the given pollutant group and the likelihood that the 50%ile EMC values will exceed
receiving water body ESs, specified either as maximum allowable concentration or annual average values.
Step 2. SuDS pollution mitigation index (PMI) assessment
The authors then adopt scaling ranges to indicate the removal potential by which different types of SuDS
are able to remove different pollutant groups. The ranges adopted are between 0 and 1, and hence are
only qualitative, that is a lower index value indicates a better treatment performance, but the allocated
scores cannot be used to indicate the magnitude of the difference (Table 26.14).
Step 3. Land use pollution index (LUPI) and site pollution index (SPI) assessment
A land use pollution index (LUPI) (for each pollutant group) for the different land use areas contributing to
the discharge point is evaluated by multiplying the pollution index (PI) by the pollution mitigation indices
(PMI) for each SuDS component used.
The final site pollution index (SPI) is an aggregation of the different LUPIs weighted by their area.
Step 4. Assessment against an environmental baseline
The final step is to make a comparison of the resulting averaged SPI index against a recognised value or
standard for receiving water quality, in order to evaluate any likely risk exposure associated with the site
SuDS discharge. The procedure then associates different SPI levels with different receiving water quality
levels, for example the EA River Ecosystem Class (REC).
REC standards have now been superseded by WFD standards the relevant environmental
regulator should be contacted to agree appropriate environmental standards.
The research sets out a structured impact assessment methodology, but has some limitations that
potentially make it unsuitable for use as a generic SuDS design approach:
1 It does not include the determination of treatment requirements upstream of infiltration components
(ie it accounts for the removal of pollutants from the discharge from the site to surface water
bodies, but it does not take into consideration the potential need for treatment of the infiltrated water
before discharge to groundwaters). This means that there is a risk of the method being misused by
implying that the use of infiltration components can protect receiving surface water bodies, without
considering the risk to groundwater.
Chapter 26: Water quality management
591
Chapter 25 Infiltration design methods 591
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
2 The multiplicative procedure used considers the behaviour of each SuDS on a standalone basis
rather than as a component in a Management Train. In reality, the removal performance of
downstream SuDS components tends to be lower due to lower pollutant exposures and capabilities.
3 The method requires a determination regarding the acceptability of the impact level for different
receiving water bodies. If an SPI of < 0.1 is considered appropriate for surface water discharges (ie
negligible impact level), then a very high number of components would usually be required. If SPI
of < 0.2 is considered acceptable (ie minimal impact level, small reduction in pollution tolerant tax),
then this will still tend to require a higher number of components than general good practice might
normally suggest.
However, the work provides a potential methodology that could be used in the design of treatment
systems and is also a good basis for future studies and assessment. Where it is used, the full paper
should be referenced, rather than relying on the information provided here.

27Chapter Pollution prevention
strategies
This chapter discusses strategies that can be used to avoid or minimise
the generation of pollutants and how to prevent pollutants mixing with
runoff before it enters the drainage system.
Capturing, treating and removal of pollutants within the drainage system
is the purpose of treatment design and is not discussed here. The
mobilisation of pollutants from contaminated land is also not covered here.
Guidance on water quality management and treatment design is provided in Chapters 4 and
26 respectively, as well as the individual SuDS component chapters (Chapters 11–23).
Chapter 31 provides details of temporary erosion and sediment control measures
required to prevent pollutants from leaving sites during construction. It also provides
guidance to help ensure site surface water management systems are appropriately
implemented during construction projects.
Managing the risk of mobilising pollutants from contaminated land is covered in Chapter 8.
27.1 GENERAL DESCRIPTION
Pollution prevention strategies are methods used on site to manage pollutants at their
source. These strategies may be part of:
the approved site design or operational strategy, required in order to reduce
environmental risks to acceptable levels
standard operational best practice of the site users and/or operators
community strategies promoted by local environmental bodies to raise awareness
of the risks posed by pollutants in surface runoff and actions that can be taken to
minimise them.
Many of these are common sense working practices and are relatively inexpensive and
easy to implement. For example, dust and debris can be swept or vacuumed from a
work area and disposed of as waste, instead of using a hose to wash it into a surface
water drain or SuDS.
SuDS components capture and remove pollutants after they have mixed with rainfall,
but they cannot remove 100% of the pollutants (Chapter 4). The most effective way of
preventing pollution getting into surface water discharges is to prevent pollutants from
entering the surface water drainage system in the first place. With new substances
coming onto the market all the time that have the potential to be harmful to the natural
environment, pollution prevention is becoming increasingly important. In some cases,
pollution prevention strategies can be sufficient to remove the pollution risk downstream
almost entirely.
For a high hazard site, pollution prevention may be a regulatory requirement, to
ensure that the downstream drainage system does not pose an unacceptable risk
to the receiving environment. Many pollution prevention strategies can reduce the
maintenance requirements of downstream drainage components or prevent the need for
clean-up and rehabilitation works, and may be promoted by drainage system owners/
operators and/or local environmental groups.
Chapter 27: Pollution prevention strategies
Chapter 27: Pollution prevention strategies
597
597
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Pollution prevention should follow a hierarchical approach:
1 Avoid the use of materials and activities that generate pollutants.
2 Minimise the use of materials and activities that generate pollutants.
3 Prevent pollutants mixing with rainfall.
4 Capture pollution within the drainage system for removal, treatment or clean-up and rehabilitation
(where required).
Pollution prevention strategies, as discussed here, cover actions 1–3.
Pollution prevention strategies are most effective when they are an integral part of community behaviour
and site management processes. This chapter provides information to help:
a) individuals, businesses and local authorities identify strategies for controlling pollutants at source
and preventing contamination of surface water runoff
b) designers identify physical measures for preventing the mixing of pollutants with rainfall, or trapping
pollutants before they enter SuDS.
The design of pollution prevention strategies needs to take into account the use of the site, the types of
pollutants that may be present and the operational processes on the site. Different types of pollutants (as
presented in Table 4.1, Chapter 4) may require different strategies.
The rest of this chapter summarises pollution prevention strategies, following the hierarchical approach
set out above (Sections 27.2–27.4) and the education and training strategies required to facilitate their
delivery (Section 27.5).
27.2 AVOID POLLUTING MATERIALS AND ACTIVITIES
Where possible, activities or materials that have the potential to result in pollution should be avoided or
substituted.
An example of the effective removal of a pollutant source is the identification and removal of illicit
connections of foul water discharges to SuDS. Surface SuDS will help in exposing the location and likely
source of any wrongly connected inputs as poor water quality and possibly sewage solids/fungus may be
visible. This can help identification of the problem by local homeowners, property owners or maintenance
bodies and allow action to be taken. During the lifetime of the SuDS, further wrong connections may
occur upstream, which may be identified by SuDS inspection regimes or property surveys.
27.3 MINIMISE POLLUTING MATERIALS OR ACTIVITIES
Where practicable, site users should be encouraged to use materials and undertake activities likely to
pose the lowest risk to the receiving environment. This not only helps to keep potential disposal, storage
and other pollution problems to a minimum, but can also be more cost-effective.
For example, landscape and road surface management activities often use chemicals that are readily
mixed with rainfall and discharged to the surface water management system, potentially causing damage
and pollution. The application of fertilisers, pesticides and herbicides can be used during the operational
life of the SuDS, if used appropriately and proportionately, having evaluated the risks and provided
appropriate mitigation.
De-icing agents can also pose risks, particularly where they are mixed with sand (causing more solids
wash-off, which is not desirable). However, calcium magnesium acetate, potassium acetate, or similar
materials, cause less adverse environmental impact than urea and sodium chloride in de-icing materials.
598 Part E: Supporting guidance
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Consideration of rates of application of de-icing materials onto road surfaces should form part of the risk
management approach and should always follow best practice guidance.
Best practices for painting, resurfacing and resealing of roads, pavements, fencing or other public space
infrastructure should be followed to minimise risks.
The wash-off from vehicle cleaning should not be discharged into the surface water system. Solvents and
cleaning products should be avoided, where there is a risk that the cleaning water could mix with surface
water runoff. The use of cleaning products and potentially harmful chemicals should always be controlled,
and eliminated where possible.
Products labelled as biodegradable can still be harmful to the environment and should not be discharged
to a surface water drainage system.
Consideration should be given as to whether polluting activities can be undertaken less frequently or
done over shorter periods of time. For example, raw materials could be delivered to a site closer to the
time of use, reducing the need for stockpiling and exposure to the weather.
27.4 PREVENT POLLUTANTS MIXING WITH RAINFALL
Where practicable, the site should be designed and used in such a way as to minimise pollutants mixing
with rainfall. There are a number of actions that can help to achieve this. Examples are provided in the
following subsections.
27.4.1 Cover the polluting activity
Covering sources of pollutants can prevent their mobilisation with rainfall, and activities with a high
pollutant risk should not take place on areas discharging to the surface water drainage system.
Vehicle washing areas can be covered (roofed) or can be designed to use dedicated wash-bays
discharging to the foul sewer. The drainage for the site can also be designed to prevent rainwater entering
these areas and contributing to the discharge to the foul sewer.
Liquids arising from areas such as fuel delivery and refuelling areas; vehicle loading or unloading zones
where potentially polluting materials are handled; oil/chemical storage, handling and delivery areas; and
stockpiles of soil and other waste products should be collected, contained and disposed of safely.
Unloading and storing containers with chemicals beneath a covered loading bay or canopy, for example,
would reduce the risk of spills polluting runoff, but appropriate ventilation and fire precautions would need
to be implemented.
27.4.2 Contain and separate pollutants
The use of materials that can cause significant pollution risks may require facilities to contain any
spillages, such as bunding of oil and chemical storage areas, trays and liners. These should be
specifically designed to suit the facility and operation.
Site owners should always ensure that solid and liquid wastes are disposed of appropriately. There are
generally four options for disposal, depending on the type of waste and concentrations of the associated
contaminants. These should be considered in order of preference:
recycling facilities
municipal solid waste disposal facilities
hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal facilities
foul sewer treatment facilities.
Chapter 27: Pollution prevention strategies
Chapter 27: Pollution prevention strategies
599
599
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Many liquid wastes can be discharged to a foul sewer, subject to approval from the sewerage undertaker. If
wastes cannot be legally discharged to a foul sewer, one of the other three disposal options (listed above)
should be used. Surface water runoff should never be drained to the foul sewer due to risks of overloading.
Sumps or holding tanks may be useful for storing liquid wastes temporarily, but the contents must then be
disposed of properly. Dangerous and hazardous wastes must be transported to an appropriate hazardous
waste disposal, treatment or storage facility.
Where solid wastes are stored outdoors on site, including recycling waste that is contaminated, then
runoff from these areas will need to be treated specifically to manage the pollution risk before discharge
to the surface water drainage system.
Walton (201) provides guidance to assist owners and operators of industrial and commercial facilities in
storing substances that may be hazardous to the environment.
An example of containing the supply of pollutants is the implementation of a street sweeping and/or gully
inlet/silt trap emptying regime. Such strategies are known to be effective at limiting pollution by capturing
and disposing of dust and debris before it enters the surface water management system. General control of
litter and other solids, including leaf fall, is also important for a range of urban surfaces, not only streets.
In some scenarios, light liquid/oil/petrol separators may be appropriate for managing low levels of
hydrocarbons from, for example, car parks (BS EN 858-1:2002 and BS EN 858-2:2003). All trapped
materials should be recycled, where practicable.
Guidance on proprietary products that separate out oils, sediments and other contaminants is
provided in Chapter 14.
27.4.3 Manage the pollutant conveyance pathway
Locating potentially polluting activities away from runoff routes will reduce the chance of pollutants mixing
with surface water flows. For high risk areas, such as where chemicals are being handled, the provision
of flow diversion or cut-off structures, along with instruction notices, can help prevent polluted runoff from
entering the surface water drainage system.
Activities located far from known overland runoff routes are less likely to pollute surface water runoff. It
will take longer for the pollutants to mix with the runoff and drain into the SuDS components, allowing
more time for a response to a spill. Depending on the location of the activity, this may be sufficient to
allow substantial clean-up of the area around the activity.
Regardless of the location of the activity, protection of groundwater is crucial, so environmental protection
best practice and prompt responses to spills are always important in order to prevent pollution, even in
dry weather.
27.4.4 Prevent spills and provide appropriate clean-up
Spills can contribute a variety of pollutants to surface water runoff and are often preventable, if
appropriate practices for chemical and waste handling and spill response are implemented. A spill can be
a one-off event, a continuous leak or frequent small spills. All types of spill should be addressed.
Leaks and spills of solid or liquid pollutants (including oils, solvents, fuels and dust from manufacturing
operations) should be contained promptly, and an appropriate clean-up regime implemented.
Appropriate spillage/clean-up kits should always be available, and operational measures may require
emergency teams and procedures for responding in the event of a spill incident. This should include due
consideration of motor vehicle accidents and vandalism, where appropriate. Spill risks should also be
considered during the construction phase and appropriate procedures put in place.
Where a site is deemed to be at risk from catastrophic events, such as a major explosion, this should be
taken into consideration, as these can cause acute pollution. There is renewed emphasis on planning
600 Part E: Supporting guidance
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
for potentially catastrophic events and these are considered further in Gilbertson et al (2011) and ISO
31000:2009.
27.4.5 Move the activity elsewhere
If the above options are too onerous, one alternative is to consider moving the polluting activity off site,
and to use a dedicated facility elsewhere.
27.5 PROVIDE EDUCATION AND TRAINING
All businesses operating on sites drained by SuDS should set up and document regimes for site pollution
prevention best practice, based on the guidance provided above.
Staff on commercial and industrial premises should be aware of the site pollution prevention strategy, and
the operational procedures required to minimise the risks of causing water pollution and the associated
legal consequences.
Improving public understanding of the operation of surface water drainage systems and the potential for
water pollution using education and information can encourage pollution prevention. Such campaigns
can be initiated by the owner of the surface water management system or by a partnership that includes
environmental regulators, local authorities and/or other environmental groups. The impact of dog fouling,
vehicular washing and the disposal of wastes (eg paints, solvents) to surface water drains should be
explained, along with recommendations for alternative forms of disposal. Public education strategies can
also promote the benefits of using environmentally friendly substances (Section 27.3).
Signs that highlight the possible impacts, either at or near the SuDS, or at inlet locations, are an effective
means of raising community awareness of pollution. The Environment Agency and SEPA promote the
Yellow Fish campaign (EA, 2012a and 2012b) as part of their Healthy River Code (EA, nd), for use in
public engagement and business and contractor education strategies (Figures 27.1 and 27.2).

This chapter provides guidance on the design of inlets, outlets and
flow control systems nlets and outlets are the structures or landscape
features that convey the flow into and out of a SuS component ontrol
structures limit the flow through the outlet of a SuS component
uidance on good landscape practice is discussed in hapter
28.1 INTRODUCTION
Inlets and outlets are the structures or landscape features that manage the flow into
and out of a SuDS component. Control structures limit the flow through the outlet
and are usually necessary in order to meet the site discharge rate. Limiting the flow
causes water to back up in the SuDS component, allowing the attenuation storage
volume to be filled.
There is a wide variety of different types and styles of structure/feature available, and
they can be designed to add interest and character to an urban setting, or to blend into
a natural landscape.
The suitability of different types of inlet or outlet will often depend on the type of
component they are serving and the processes it supports. In some cases, the type
of component (eg permeable pavements or attenuation tank storage systems) or the
constraints of a site, will lead to the use of below-ground control structures (sited in
access chambers, commonly adapted from standard inspection chamber specifications
for non-man-entry and standard manhole specifications for man-entry access).
Where a SuDS scheme includes Interception components and manages runoff close
to source (Chapter 4), velocities tend to be low, and control structures can be small.
Keeping runoff on the surface helps keep inlets and outlets shallow, visible and
cost-effective. Headwalls and abutments should be as small as possible and can be
designed using local materials, such as local stone, local bricks, timber etc. Where
concrete is used, it can be textured or clad to add interest and blend more effectively
with nearby natural features. Sympathetic planting around the structures can help with
their integration into the landscape, but this should not impede operation or obscure
their easy viewing, for inspections. Planting can also be used to help prevent erosion,
using planting mats and other bioengineered materials that are often deployed for
channel bank protection. Other options include using stone or other rip-rap materials for
energy dissipation.
In all cases, the hydraulic, structural and geotechnical design of inlet and outlet
structures should be undertaken by designers with appropriate technical/engineering
expertise. Guidance on siing is provided in this chapter, but textbooks, such as those
by Chow (1959) and Henderson (1966), should be referenced for detailed theory
relevant to the hydraulic design, where necessary.

28.2 GENERAL DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS
Flow is conveyed to, from and between SuDS components in open channels, across vegetated surfaces
or within pipework. The definition of flow structures used in this chapter is as follows
An inlet structure conveys flow into a SuDS component.
An outlet structure conveys flow out of a SuDS component.
A control structure restricts the rate of flow into or from an outlet structure.
The details presented in this chapter for erosion control measures downstream of an inlet structure
may also be adapted by the designer for outlet structures where they discharge into receiving waters
downstream.
The following issues should be considered when designing inlet and outlet structures
simplicity of operation
resistance to clogging, blocking or mechanical failure
local landscape characteristics
cost and ease of construction
accessibility, visibility, cost and ease of maintenance
606 Part E Supporting guidance
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
longevity and reliability
health and safety with respect to construction, operation and maintenance.
Surface control structures such as simple orifices (small diameter holes) or slot weirs are usually
relatively easy to maintain, provided they are visible and accessible. Below-ground systems will usually
need to have a cover lifted for inspection, and may therefore be overlooked or forgotten about. The risk
of this should be assessed by the designer, and an appropriate risk management approach adopted for
the site. On large managed sites the maintenance of buried structures is rarely a major issue. However,
the system should be designed so that, if it does become blocked, it is apparent on the surface before it
poses a significant risk. Small discrete features in the landscape can also be overlooked if they become
hidden by vegetation or debris.
Where any pond or basin is regulated under the Reservoir Act 1975 as amended by the Flood and Water
Management Act 2010 that is, it can hold 10,000 m3 of water, the inlet and outlet designs must meet the
requirements of this legislation. Any structure discharging into a watercourse or culverted watercourse
will need consent from either the environmental regulator, lead local flood (or drainage) authority or the
internal drainage board, and any relevant byelaws should be taken into account, where relevant.
Health and safety risk management design guidance is provided in Chapter 36.
28.3 INLET AND OUTLET LAYOUT
SuDS components can generally be divided into three ones
1 inlet zone includes appropriate design for velocity reduction and effective flow distribution across
the width of the SuDS component and may also include a sediment trapping and storage area
2 main treatment, storage and/or conveyance area
3 outlet zone may be deeper than the main area to prevent resuspension of sediments, or may be
designed with a raised outfall to encourage enhanced infiltration, filtration and/or other treatment
processes before discharge.
In order to maximise the effectiveness of treatment processes between inlet and outlet, short-circuiting
should be avoided that is dead treatment storage areas (areas within the system that are bypassed by
the normal passage of flow and are therefore ineffective in the treatment process) should be minimised.
Examples of poor and improved configurations are presented in Figure 28.2. Where design shapes are
fixed and not ideal, baffles may be used to help lengthen flow paths.
Figure 2.2 Examples of poor and improved inlet and outlet configurations
Chapter 2 Inlets, outlets and flow control systems
607
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
28.4 INLET SYSTEMS
The mechanism by which runoff is collected and delivered to a SuDS component will vary, depending on
the component type, site layout, topography and flow paths. Pervious pavements and green roofs collect
runoff directly without the need for inlets. Filter strips, filter drains and swales should generally receive
runoff via lateral inlet systems that distribute the flow along a continuous or semi-continuous length.
Point inlets from piped collection systems are usually required for inflows to ponds and detention basins.
Runoff will often be discharged into bioretention systems, and some swales via gaps or holes in kerbing.
There will always be other site-specific scenarios that will require the modification of standard inlet
configurations, such as the delivery of roof water into a pervious pavement sub-base, and the introduction
of water into swales via point source inlets.
28.4.1 Inlet design
All inlets should be designed to meet the following requirements
deliver the required maximum flow rate freely from the upstream collection system
be as simple as possible (taking into account the characteristics of the site and the level of
management)
be easy to construct
be structurally robust
functionality is clear and obvious for those who will maintain them and for the local community
(where appropriate)
be easy and convenient to maintain (eg easily accessible for the required operations, and requiring
maintenance frequencies that align with the site landscape maintenance requirements)
have low risk of blockage
have low risk of erosion
have low risks to people (eg no open pipework accessible to small children)
have low risks to wildlife, taking into account the site-specific characteristics and likely biodiversity
(eg no exposed sumps, traps, gullies or open inlets to sewers)
be visually interesting or neutral (ie no negative aesthetics)
have low risk of vandalism
be cost-effective.
Specific inlet details for each SuDS component are set out in individual chapters (Chapters 11–23). This
chapter presents generic concepts, together with hydraulic control principles.
28.4.2 Point inlets
Components of a standard, small piped inlet system are likely to comprise
1 conveyance pipe of suitable diameter to allow unrestricted flow, laid to appropriate fall, with bedding
and surround
2 inlet protection to the pipe, such as a small concrete surround, a small headwall, stone-filled
baskets or gabion protection
3 erosion control (if required) such as concrete, stone or sett pad, rip-rap or other apron device to
reduce energy within the inflow that may damage the SuDS component surface and/or planting
4 o sreain (if required) such as a horiontal sill or low berm to prevent flow channelling and
maximise treatment efficiencies of vegetated surfaces.

CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Inlet design should recognise the source of the upstream flow. Where the surface water runoff is discharged
from a filter drain, or pervious pavement, it will be free from any debris or sediment that might need to
be removed, and therefore a grille or stone protection for the inlet would be acceptable. Where water is
collected from an open system, such as a swale or hard surface, there is always a risk that silt, litter or
vegetation could block the pipe, and so ease of maintenance is fundamental to the design.
Inlets raised above any adjacent permanent water levels are generally recommended. Submerged inlets
have the following potential risks
surcharging or backwater effect on the upstream surface water conveyance system
scour/resuspension of the component base near the inlet
clogging of the inlet by sedimentation near the inlet
sediment deposition in the upstream conveyance system.
Also, all concealed infrastructure is likely to be at risk from blockage or lack of maintenance.
Hard engineered erosion protection systems can often be replaced by deep pools and planted
berms. Pools dissipate energy and moderate velocities, which in turn help to limit the resuspension of
accumulated sediments. Planted rock berms can create low weirs that are resistant to breaching and
allow debris to accumulate upstream. Where regular sediment removal is likely to be required such as
within a forebay, a concrete base may be appropriate.
Examples of current good practice are shown in Figure 28.3.
Where high flows are unavoidable and larger diameter pipes are involved, concrete, brick or stone head
walls may be required. There may also be a need for safety/security screening of pipe outfalls. In such
situations, the hard surface should be carefully integrated with the adjacent landscaping to enhance
aesthetic impact, minimise safety risks (eg trip haards) and facilitate maintenance. Such structures
should be very carefully designed if they are to be acceptable from a maintenance, amenity and
sustainability perspective. Vertical concrete faces on outlets, in particular, tend to exacerbate blockage
risks (this is not an issue on inlets) and large vertical drops can easily pose a health and safety risk, which
is generally not effectively mitigated through the use of fencing. Siting planting beds above inlets can help
to disguise them from above, while still allowing access from below and may reduce the need for fencing.
Erosion control systems and more formal energy dissipation devices for inlets are described in
Section 28.4.6.
28.4.3 Lateral inlets
Where runoff is draining laterally from an impermeable surface and is collected by a SuDS component
running along its edge (eg filter strip, swale, filter drain or bioretention system) the collection mechanism
should provide an appropriate edge detail to the pavement, which allows the transfer of runoff to the
SuDS and minimises the risk of flow channelling that can cause deterioration in performance or failure
of the downstream SuDS.
It is important that grass growth is robust at the edge of the detail to prevent erosion of the SuDS surface.
This will generally require topsoil depths of 100150 mm, which may mean that kerb depths need to be
increased, or a revised edging detail used. Also, the receiving grass surface should be 200 mm below
the kerb edge, so that the runoff can discharge freely and there is no risk of sediment accumulation
blocking the flow path (Chapter 9).
Gravel strips or tactile paving blocks can also be used to pre-filter and spread the flow downstream of
kerb edges. Silt is collected within the gravel strips, although such strips (eventually) tend to only act as
flow spreaders as the silt cannot easily be removed during operation and maintenance activities.

Kerbless road designs allow surface water runoff to flow directly from the impervious surface to the SuDS
component. This type of design discourages flow concentration and reduces flow velocities.
The structural integrity of kerbless and flush kerb design needs careful consideration in order to prevent
deterioration of the surface edging (and potential collapse) due to traffic movements etc. Moving of the
surface edge can end up preventing runoff from flowing off the surface into the SuDS component. Where
there are particular risks of significant traffic movement at the surface edge, the surface edging should be
strengthened or alternative designs considered.
28.4.5 Kerb openings
Where flow is to be introduced via kerb
openings, the dimension of any kerb opening
should provide a sufficient width of flow to
minimise risks of erosion, channelling or
blockage (0000 mm is normally sufficient
where inflow paths are straight, but 600 mm
should be the minimum where the flow direction
is at an angle to the inlet aperture. The edge
should be flush with the runoff surface to
prevent ponding and sedimentation.
Surface water can also be collected using gully
or kerb collection systems that convey the
water to downstream treatment, conveyance
and/or storage components.

o sreaders and ener dissiation
For lateral collection systems, flow spreading is required to ensure even distribution of flows (in case
upstream flow paths have been distorted or concentrated) and is usually achieved using a level sill (kerb
or concrete section), a gravel strip (gravel diaphragm) or a shallow channel.
For point inflows, flow spreaders are designed to distribute concentrated flows over a larger area to
reduce flow velocities, thereby controlling erosion risks and maximising the treatment effectiveness of the
receiving SuDS component. There are many types of spreaders that can be selected, based on the rates
of inflow and site characteristics.
However, their generic design objectives should be
concentrated flow enters the spreader at a single point such as a pipe, swale or kerb opening
the flow is slowed and energy is released
the flow is distributed.
612 Part E Supporting guidance
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
The following considerations are important when designing and constructing flow spreaders
1 It is critical that any edges over which flow is distributed are exactly level. If there are even small
variations in height on the downstream lip, small rivulets will form, and experience suggests that
variations of more than mm can cause water to re-concentrate and potentially cause erosion.
2 The downstream side of the spreader should be clear of material (usually achieved by the
downstream side being at a lower elevation), otherwise flow paths can be blocked.
The vegetated surface downstream of the spreader should be fully stabilised before the spreader is
used, else erosion rills will quickly form.
Flow spreaders should not be considered to be sediment removal facilities themselves, although they
can be combined with forebays of, for example, smooth concrete where sediment can be collected.
The Priors Farm inlet (shown in Figure 28.8) uses raised granite sets and the planting has been designed
to contribute to flow spreading and dissipation when established.

Bypass structures can be used to divert flows
above a threshold into a bypass pipe or channel or
directly into another SuDS component, providing
greater attenuation storage than the main flow route
(for example, as shown in Figure 28.9). The same
configuration could be used to bypass volumes of
runoff from extreme events into a Long-Term Storage
or exceedance storage area.
In such cases, the inlet structure will normally include
a means of controlling the flows that pass to the
SuDS component. The complexity of the structure
will depend on the level of flow control required. A
crucial factor in designing flow dividing structures is to
ensure that the correct low flow is retained on the main
drainage path and that, above this rate, extra flows are
diverted with minimal increase in head at the bypass
structure to avoid surcharging the main drainage path
under high flow conditions.
Figure 2.9 Requirements for flow bypass structures
For surface flows, flow diversion structures can often be constructed through the use of appropriate
landscaping alone for example, for an off-line detention basin it may be possible to spill high flows over

a low section of a channel bank into the detention basin, without any control on the flows passing on
down the channel other than the channel capacity itself. Figure 28.10 illustrates such a system, with low/
medium range flows passed downstream to a treatment wetland.

Simple overflow inlet to detention basin no restriction on flow passed downstream as shown but could
Protection may be needed for the weir crest
and face of the detention basin to prevent
erosion from the flow. This has taken the form
of bioengineered grassed surfaces in some
sites where flows are low. Other solutions that
have been used are thin gabion mattresses
or small cellular concrete blocks allowing the
development of partial grass cover, although,
for occasional periods of discharge, a well
grassed surface is likely to be adequate. The
design of grass-lined spillways has been
documented in Hewlett et al (197).
For piped flows, and where flows need to be
tightly controlled, a harder structure may be
required. This scenario is likely to be relevant
Figure 2.11 Example of landscaped flow splitter structure,
River Chelt (courtesy Illman Young)
only for heavily urbanised, high density
development where the majority of the drainage infrastructure has to be below ground. Maintenance and
safety issues should always be given full consideration.
Engineered manhole flow dividers are likely to comprise one or two chambers with pipe or weir outlets
(Figure 28.12).
In cases where the normal and higher flow outflow routes from the chamber(s) are both via pipes, it is also
advisable to include an emergency high-level weir, designed to deal with extreme return period flows and
also to pass flows in the event of blockage of the pipe(s). The emergency weir may pass extreme flows to a
detention basin, or a bypass route, or possibly both.
61 Part E Supporting guidance
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Figure 2.12 Conceptual design for engineered inlet flow divider
The key requirement of the hydraulic design of the inlet structure is the need for appropriate design and
siing of the pipes and weirs to achieve the required discharge relationships, including the derivation of
appropriate threshold water depths and levels that are compatible with the available hydraulic head.
There may be more than one inlet to a pond or detention basin. In such cases, consideration needs to
be given to whether the economic and functional requirements can be more effectively met by either
combining the incoming pipe systems upstream of any inlet flow divider or by providing a number of
separate inlet divider structures. Care needs to be taken to ensure that there is no opportunity for any
adverse short-circuiting between the outlet and the nearest inlet. It is recommended that, where such
systems have to be implemented, they are kept as simple as possible.
28.4.8 Sediment detention (sediment trap or forebay)
Effective pre-treatment should ideally be implemented via appropriate upstream SuDS Management Train
components (Chapter 26). Where there are residual sediment risks, or where a sediment forebay is the
only suitable management option at the site, then SuDS components can be split to delineate specific
areas where sediment removal is specifically facilitated. Sediment detention may either be undertaken
in a separate basin or pond, or within a sediment detention area that is part of a SuDS component. A
sediment trapping area allows sediment build-up to be easily monitored, and any required sediment
removal activities are concentrated within a small area, thereby minimising potential damage to other
SuDS areas (Chapters 11–23).
Sediment waste management is discussed in detail in Chapter 33 and in individual component
chapters.
If the sediment deposition area is designed to be intermittently dry, this will aid biodegradation of organic
pollutants. Planting can be used to screen and/or enhance sediment deposition areas.
Where a sediment detention facility can only be included within a pond or wetland, a simple approach is
to include a weir or bank across the pond. The design will depend on the depth and configuration of the
basin, but the following approaches should normally be considered (either singly or in combination) to
separate the sediment basin from the rest of the pond
1 permeable weir, such as gabions, through which low flows would normally pass, but allowing
overflows for larger events
2 earth embankment, designed to overtop and protected accordingly
Appropriate access should always be provided to allow removal of accumulated sediment.
Chapter 2 Inlets, outlets and flow control systems
615
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
28.5 OUTLET STRUCTURE (OUTLETS AND FLOW CONTROL SYSTEMS)
Outlet structures convey and control the flow out of the SuDS components and, therefore, determine
the ability of the system to manage both low and high flows. Outlets can either be on the surface (open
channels built into the visible edge of the component), piped systems (conveying water through the edge
of the component) or slow seepage systems (conveying water slowly through a porous medium).
Low return period flows are normally controlled with smaller, often protected, outlet structures, such as
orifices located within screened pipes or risers, perforated plates or risers, small pipes, reverse-slope
pipes and V-notch weirs. Larger flows are typically controlled using overflows, such as flows over a weir
within a manhole or across a spillway/weir through an embankment. Overflow weirs can be of varied
heights and configured to handle control of multiple design flows.
Vortex flow control systems can also be used to manage a range of flows (Section 28.5.7).
Outlets are usually built into the downstream bankside of SuDS components with easy access for
maintenance.
For piped systems, a box or manhole outlet structure downstream of the outlet can accommodate a
variety of flow control mechanisms, although the depth of such structures should be considered carefully
in the context of access, ease of maintenance and confined entry requirements. Any pipe bedding and/
or surround material can be a conveyance route, and where flow controls are included within the design,
impervious fill/protection against seepage is required.
Similar techniques to those described for inlets can be employed to integrate outlet structures into the
overall landscape. Natural stone and plant material can be used in place of concrete and hard structures
to meet aesthetic, amenity, ecology and sustainability objectives. Any outlet design should minimise the
risk of clogging and blockage, and their siting should allow access for ease of maintenance.
28.5.1 Outlet system design
The siing of outlet structures is typically a process where iteration is used to refine the design
details. A stage discharge curve is usually established for a given outlet design. Then calculations are
undertaken or a model is run to determine whether the peak outflow for a range of return periods flows
is adequately controlled.
A key step is to identify clearly the duties that the structure needs to perform and therefore
the components that need to be included. Table 28.1 gives a broad indication of the principal
components that may be required. In general, outlet structures should be designed to be as simple
as possible to construct, operate and maintain. The main concern for all outlets should be minimising
the risk of blockage.
In the following sections, a range of outlet systems are described that are generally appropriate for
maximum water depths of up to about 2 m. SuDS designs should not involve greater depths of water.
However, should larger structures be required, designers should follow the guidance given in Hall et al
(199), which contains a comprehensive account of the types of control structures that may be deployed
for the outlet structures of on-line and off-line flood storage reservoirs.
rifies
An orifice is a circular or rectangular opening of a prescribed shape and sie that allows a controlled
rate of outflow when the orifice is submerged. When it is not submerged, the opening acts as a weir. The
flow rate depends on the height of the water above the opening (hydraulic head) and the sie and edge
treatment of the orifice. When using a simple orifice plate, the flow rate passing through the control is
directly proportional to the square root of the upstream head (Equation 28.1 and Figure 28.13), so as the
water level increases, the flow also increases steadily.

Component Description

Exceedance flow

Emergency spillway
For most SuDS components, this will normally comprise a fixed orifice, V-notch weir or
an alternative form of throttle such as a short pipe, culvert or vortex flow control with
similar hydraulic characteristics. Its principal function is to throttle the discharge passed
downstream and thereby enable the attenuation storage volume to fill.
This provides the flood discharge route from the component when the available flood
attenuation storage capacity has been filled. The weir and the flow route downstream are
normally designed to pass a flow of a particular design return period. In the case of an off-
line SuDS component, an overflow weir may not be required if the inlet structure is designed
in such a way that flows are reliably bypassed whenever the pond or basin is full. In some
cases, it may be appropriate to combine the function with the emergency spillway.
The emergency spillway provides the ultimate safeguard against uncontrolled overflows. It
may be the same structure as the overflow weir. A shallow grass weir with inclined slopes
and suitable erosion protection is often sufficient.
If a variable greenfield flood frequency curve is specified, this type of response may be appropriate, although
multiple orifices may still be required to meet multiple return period requirements. Orifices can be used for above-
ground or below-ground systems and can also be used to control flows from underdrainage components.
Orifices act as very efficient throttles
(flow constraints), and this efficiency
can be disadvantageous in some
respects in that it may put water into
storage early in the storm, while the
downstream channel still has the
capacity to accept it.
Orifices may be constructed in a
wall or baffle, in perforated risers,
or as a T-piece section such as that
shown in Figures 28.14 and 28.15.
With the inlet set below the water
surface, T-pieces help to reduce the
risks of blockage and, in particular,
the chance of oils being transported
downstream.

When the orifice is discharging as a free outfall, the effective head is measured from the centre of the

is the difference in elevation of the headwater and tailwater surfaces, as shown in Figure 28.16.

Exposed orifices with diameters similar to tennis balls and soft drink cans are particularly vulnerable to
blockage. Perforated risers with protected orifice plates can be used to minimise blockage rates for very
low flow controls (Section 28.5.3). Other outlet protection systems are described in Section 28.5.10.
Flow through multiple orifices, such as the perforated
plate shown in Figure 28.17 , can be calculated by
summing the flow through individual orifices. For
multiple orifices of the same sie and under the
influence of the same effective head, the total flow can
be determined by multiplying the discharge for a single
orifice by the number of openings.
28.5.3 Perforated risers
Perforated risers can be used in the following forms

Associates)
Perforations can become affected by silt or fine particles of vegetation and, if maintenance is not regular,
the holes in the riser can become blocked. At worst, water can rise to the top of the tube and overflow into
the outfall pipe. The bottom orifice controls the flow up to a 0000 mm head. The use of a perforated
riser tube section with equivalent orifice controls at each end will enable the tube to function correctly,
even if it is installed the wrong way round.
Disadvantages of such systems include the requirement for their siting within a subsurface manhole and
the potential maintenance implications. There will also be standing water in the manhole between storms
up to the outlet level.
ies and uerts
Pipes are often used as outlet structures for drainage control facilities and, like the orifice, their head
discharge characteristics mean that they can be efficient flow control systems. During low flow conditions,
the pipe headdischarge characteristics are the same as a weir control. As the flow increases, this will
transition into an orifice control.
The minimum outlet pipe acceptable for adoption by a sewerage undertaker is normally 75 mm, as
required by WRc (2005 and 2012). WRc (2012) gives a minimum opening sie for static (fixed) control
structures of 100 mm or equivalent. Much smaller diameters may be acceptable for SuDS owned by other
organisations, particularly for locations downstream of pervious pavements or other filtration devices
where the risk of blockage is very small or at other protected locations. The sie of hydraulic controls
should always be agreed with the site operator.
Pipes greater than 00 mm can be analysed as a discharge pipe with headwater effects (and tailwater
effects if required) taken into account. Reference should be made to standard guidance dealing with pipe
flow from Balkham et al (2010) and Barr and HR Wallingford (2006).
28.5.5 Weirs
Weirs and notches discharge proportionately more water than orifices or pipes, with an equivalent
increase in head. An advantage of weirs is that floating debris will pass downstream and they are
not vulnerable to blockage. However, this may be a concern if the component is designed to protect
620 Part E Supporting guidance
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
downstream SuDS components from debris. Weirs can be sharp-crested, broad-crested, triangular or of
various intermediate cross-sections, each of which has slightly different headdischarge characteristics,
depending on the profile, height and area of the opening. Weirs can be used as level and/or flow control
structures, and/or emergency spillway devices. There is a unique relationship between flow rate and
upstream water level when the flow is able to discharge freely over the weir (ie under modular conditions)
but not once the downstream water level is influencing the upstream level (ie during drowned flow
conditions). Discharge equations for specific weir characteristics can be determined by reference to
relevant hydraulic textbooks (eg Chow, 1959).

Weirs can be set into embankments, forming a point of visual interest, in which case full consideration
should be given to the use of natural construction materials. If they have to be housed within subsurface
chambers, special consideration should be given to their long-term operation and maintenance to ensure
robust consistent performance.
eedane o outets
A specific overflow system may be required to manage exceedance flows for
conveying flows of a greater severity than those handled by the overflow weir incorporated in the
outlet structure
preventing over-topping (and potentially catastrophic erosion) of any perimeter embankments,
caused by blockage or other failure of the outlet structure.
Chapter 2 Inlets, outlets and flow control systems
621
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
In the case of ponds and detention basins that come within the ambit of the Reservoirs Act 1975 as
amended by the Flood and Water Management Act 2010 (ie facilities with 10,000 m3 of stored water),
there is recognised guidance on the appropriate exceedance probability for the design flood to be passed
via the emergency spillway (ICE, 1996). This guidance is also relevant for ponds and detention basins
that are not covered by the Act, but would nevertheless represent a significant haard if the embankment
were to fail due to flood over-topping.
The exceedance flow route for ponds and detention basins normally comprises an open weir and
channel, the reasons for this being that
the discharge rises non-linearly, resulting in significant increases in flow for small increases in head
there is a low risk of spillway blockage by debris or by incorrect operation.
Other alternatives may be acceptable for example a labyrinth weir, a siphon, or a bell-mouth spillway
discharging to a closed conduit but spillways using gates or other moving parts are unlikely to be
appropriate. The design of grass-lined spillways has been documented in Hewlett et al (197).
assie deies orte o ontros
A number of devices are available that can vary the hydraulic characteristics of the simple orifice.
Vortex flow control devices tend to have an S-shaped discharge curve (Figure 28.21), built up of three
distinct phases, each corresponding to a different governing flow control regime
1 Pre-initiation phase at low heads, the inlet and outlet openings of the device are not submerged,
and the openings therefore act in a similar manner to an unsubmerged orifice plate. The end of this
phase is often characterised as the flush-flow or flushing point (note that this does not mean that the
devices are self-flushing).
2 Transition phase as the head increases, the inlet and outlet openings become submerged, and
a vortex will begin to form. In this region, the flow regime will be turbulent and unstable, as the
vortex will continually form and collapse, and there is insufficient energy within the flow to form and
maintain a stable vortex. A volume of air will generally become trapped inside the device, above the
inlet and outlet openings, although some devices incorporate ventilation holes in the unit to prevent
or inhibit this. This air pocket will initially compress, but will then start to exert a counter-pressure
against the flow of water and cause the flow rate to decrease as the head increases. The end of this
phase is often characterised as the kick-flow,
kickback flow or switch point.
3 Post-initiation phase as the head level continues
to increase, the entire unit becomes submerged
and sufficient hydrostatic pressure is generated to
displace the air pocket and allow a stable vortex to
form with a central air-filled core. This air-filled core
acts as a pseudo-physical restriction by reducing
the cross-sectional area of the device available for
the passage of water. In this region, the device will
operate in a similar manner to a submerged orifice
plate (Equation 28.1), with Ao being the area of the
outlet of the device minus the cross-sectional area
of the air core.
As the water level subsides following the rainfall event,
the level within the control structure will eventually
fall below the top of the device and due to dropping
pressure, the vortex will collapse. The collapse in the
vortex produces a sudden increase in the flow through
the device.

Hydro International)
622 Part E Supporting guidance
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Much like an orifice, when the device is discharging as a free outfall, then the effective head is measured
from the upstream (headwater) surface level to the level of the control (generally taken as either the
centreline of the outlet or the invert level of the outlet). If the outlet of the device is submerged, then the
effective head is the difference in elevation of the headwater and tailwater surfaces (Figure 28.16).
Compared to the steady increase in flow with head as provided by an orifice plate control, the S-shaped
head-discharge curve has
1 increased pass forward flows during the early stages of the build-up of upstream head. This feature
of the curve can sometimes enable better use of the available downstream capacity and reduce
upstream attenuation requirements. This effect is marginal for very shallow storage systems and in
any event any saving in storage should be assessed against the cost of the vortex control
2 a limited variation in flow across a range of heads. This feature of the curve can sometimes
be advantageous where the control structure aims to deliver a particular target flow rate to a
downstream component or infrastructure. The flow rate can often be within 5 of the target value
over a wide range of operating heads (Figure 28.22)
a comparable headdischarge relationship to a simple orifice plate once the design point has been
reached.
There are a number of configurations available for
passive (vortex) type devices, all of which rely on the
same basic processes described above. It is worth
noting, however, that the shape of the curve will often
vary between different configurations (Figure 28.23),
which can have an influence on pass-forward flows
and attenuation volumes when dynamic hydraulic
modelling is undertaken.
As systems can differ, it is important that evidence
is provided to support quoted performance.
There are no known standardised test methods
and reporting protocols for passive flow control
devices. However, it is recommended that testing is
undertaken by organisations that are independent
of the manufacturer, in order to ensure that the
quoted performance is supported by robust evidence
using appropriate test methods. Alternatively, the
testing and results should be peer reviewed by an
independent third party.

downstream channel (although in a well-designed SuDS scheme, flows should be low enough that
scour should not be a problem)

dissipation structures).

The design of passive (vortex) type devices is
generally undertaken by manufacturers to suit the
particular application. Some manufacturers provide
a range of standard, off-the-shelf configurations
allowing the designer to pick the device most
appropriate to their needs. Off-the-shelf devices are
lower cost than bespoke devices. Characteristics of
different devices are also included in commercially
available hydraulic modelling software packages.
Multiple devices can be used in series, in parallel
or in combination with other controls, such as
orifices or weirs to meet the requirements of
different return periods.

Active control systems provide the operator with the ability to take an operational action based on
the current or predicted status of the system at one or more locations. This requires the status of the
system to be measured at key points, and the information has to be relayed to a control unit or operator
(eg where pumps are switched on based on a water level status). The action can be a manual or
automated intervention.
SuDS, as with any other form of drainage, can potentially benefit from decisions to control flow rates in
various parts of the system at particular times. The critical duration event for most SuDS components is
quite long, and for the main attenuation storage it is often longer than 2 hours. In comparison, receiving
sewers may have critical durations in the range of 0 minutes to 2 hours. This provides an opportunity for
active controls to prevent runoff from the site during periods when the sewer is already at capacity.
Active controls are not normally used to deliver the standard hydraulic criteria associated with
discharges from sites, though sensors could be used to measure flows in the system and control flow
rates accordingly using variable throttles, provided that the return period of the event taking place could
be pre-established.
624 Part E Supporting guidance
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
The performance of active control units can be designed to meet the flow requirements for a range of
return periods with a single device thus avoiding multiple units.
Float or displacement control systems generally make use of adjustable gates attached to a float or
counterbalance. Rising water levels will cause the float to rise or will exert greater force against the
counterbalance to progressively reduce the cross-sectional area of the outlet opening. There can be
problems with debris or ice affecting the movement of the gate, and maintenance regimes will need to be
robust to ensure the continued operation of the control device.
Active systems that operate in real time will need to incorporate sophisticated control and feedback
systems that detect water levels within the drainage system and adjust the flow control settings
accordingly. This type of system allows the flow characteristics to be close to ideally matched to the site
requirements and can often be programmed to meet the requirements of a range of conditions, but will
include significant additional costs for both installation and operation and maintenance. Also, there is a
need to make sure that there is a failsafe state that operates if power failure or other problem occurs.
Pumps can be used on SuDS where required, but in most cases it is better to keep water at or close to
the surface and use gravity flow systems wherever possible to minimise energy use and to reduce the
risks associated with power failure.
28.5.9 Energy dissipation
The primary objective of erosion protection at pipe outlets is the reduction of velocity. Therefore, a
key consideration in selecting the type of outlet protection is the design outlet velocity for the pipes or
channels involved. This will be dependent on the flow profile associated with the design storm. Where
flows have been effectively managed at source, energy dissipation structures should usually only be
required for overflows and emergency spillway structures.
Examples of energy dissipation options include
reducing outlet velocities using upstream SuDS component and/or flow controls
reducing pipe gradient (but not less than the required self-cleansing velocity)
rip-rap aprons and basins
loose stone
gabions
reinforced grass
granite setts
concrete stilling basins
baffle blocks within a headwall.
For SuDS designs, hard systems such as concrete stilling basins and baffle blocks should not be
required as velocities should be relatively low. Flow alignment and outfall setback can be considered in
conjunction with energy dissipation in sensitive receiving environments.
A few of the options are described in more detail in the sections below. Further guidance (including
detailed design equations) is available in HA (200), Balkham et al (2010) and Kirby et al (2015).
Rip-rap aprons
A rip-rap lining is a flexible stone layer. It will adjust to settlement, can also serve to trap sediment and
reduce flow velocities through a higher Manning’s roughness coefficient. The velocities from SuDS
components should be sufficiently low that protection such as aprons is rarely needed. Where piped flows
produce erosive conditions that cannot be avoided appropriate hard engineering designs need to be
developed using standard guidelines and manufacturer’s design guidance.
Chapter 2 Inlets, outlets and flow control systems
625
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Gabions
Gabions can be used as an erosion dissipating surface beneath an outfall. The boxes should either
be manufactured of stainless steel or of galvanised steel wire with a PVC coating to prevent inc from
entering the water. The rock or gravel fill should be of a sufficient diameter to prevent washout (usually
single sied stone) and the dimensions of the blanket should follow a similar design process to that given
in Equation 28.1.
Gabions in SuDS are usually not load-bearing and therefore thin mattress types (150 mm or so) are
usually sufficient. These also allow vegetation to become established, which acts to aid their function in
the system.
28.5.10 Outlet protection
If not adequately protected, small, low flow orifices can easily block, preventing the structural control
from meeting its design purpose and potentially causing flooding and other adverse impacts. There are a
number of different anti-clogging design approaches, including
gravel surround
gabion protection
reverse slope outlet pipe for a pond or wetland with a permanent pool the submerged inlet prevents
floatables from clogging the pipe, and this also avoids discharging warmer water at the surface
of the pond, but this design option is not easily visible and therefore its maintenance tends to get
overlooked, increased long-term blockage risks
orifices protected within perforated risers or T-pieces
debris guards (stainless steel guard open top and bottom)
hooded outlets
Examples of debris guards are shown in Figure 28.27.
Figure 2.27 Examples of debris guards over low-flow outlet control structures (courtesy Robert Bray Associates)
28.5.11 Trash screens and safety grilles
Balkham et al (2010) and Graham et al (2009) contain guidance on the use and design of screens (trash
screens and security grilles), appropriate to UK conditions.
The reasons for providing a screen are to
exclude trash which might otherwise block the conduit
capture debris in such a way that relatively easy removal is possible
prevent unauthorised access, particularly by children and small mammals (eg dogs).
Trash screens and security grilles require regular maintenance and in general do not reflect SuDS best
practice. It is recommended that such systems are only used in exceptional circumstances.
626 Part E Supporting guidance
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Inlet Outlet
Figure 2.2 Examples of trash screens (courtesy Illman Young)
Screens can often be the cause of significant problems, and their susceptibility to clogging should always
be given full consideration. First, the trapped debris may accumulate and result in severe impairment
of the discharge capacity of the conduit. Second, the use of security grilles on the outlet from a pipe
or culvert can result in debris accumulation that is difficult to remove. Balkham et al (2010) therefore
recommends that a thorough assessment be carried out of the need for screens and that, wherever
possible, screens should be avoided.
In cases where there is easy public access and an outlet structure discharges to a pipe or culvert that
would be haardous to enter, or where there is a supply of vegetation and other debris that is liable to
block a flow control device (such as a small orifice), the structure should be protected for example within
a gabion, or else an entrance screen may be required. The screen aperture should be chosen to exclude
debris liable to cause a problem, but allow through smaller debris that is unlikely to cause a blockage.
Consideration should also be given to whether or not a grille could be classed as a foot trap/trip haard,
such as 5075 mm mesh sies where the mesh could be walked over by children.
If it is decided that the exit from a pipe or culvert should be screened for security and/or safety reasons, it
is important that a significantly finer screen be deployed at the corresponding entrance, so as to avoid the
passage of debris of a sie liable to cause blockage of the exit screen.
Trash screens should be large enough that partial plugging will not adversely restrict flows reaching the
control outlet. A commonly used rule thumb is to make the screen area more than 10 times larger than
the control outlet orifice. The surface area of the screen should be maximised, and the screen should
be located a suitable distance from the protected outlet to avoid interference with the hydraulic capacity
of the outlet. The spacing of the bars should be proportional to the sie of the smallest outlet protected,
but separate screens can be used for different sied outlets. The screen should normally have hinged
connections to facilitate the removal of accumulated material, except where fears of vandalism require a
fixed grille approach.
Minimising health and safety and operational risks should be key concerns. Any grille should be able to
be cleared during events from a safe location. Structural design considerations are set out in Box 28.1.

627
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
BOX
28.1
Structural trash screen design criteria
onfirm nee
Only provide a trash screen where there is a high risk of blockage, and where such a blockage
would be significant. Major indicators are a bend or obstruction in the culvert, a very long culvert
with difficult access or a debris load that potentially contains large items.
2 Estimate debris amounts
Debris is either high (more than 60 m3 per year), medium (060 m3 per year) or low (less than 0 m3
per year). Leaves, twigs and small branches will rapidly block a screen, with blockages usually being
formed by one or two large items supporting smaller debris.
3 Design of screen
Screen angle should be 60 or less to the horiontal.
Bar spacing should not exceed 150 mm, if designed as a security screen, and should not be below
75 mm to avoid trapping small debris.
Height of the screen should not exceed 2 m.
Gross area of screen should not be less than the following
ebris loading Screen gross area
0 m3/year the greater of 6 m2 or culvert area
060 m3/year the greater of 9 m2 or 7 culvert area
60 m3/year the greater of 12 m2 or 9 culvert area
Steel member sies should not generally be less than 75 mm by mm flats (25 mm for round bars),
with lengths over 1.5 m braced.
28.6 FLOW MEASUREMENT
If accurate flow control is required, perhaps also with the facility for monitoring flows during floods, then
further steps need to be taken in the design, to ensure that appropriate forms of flow control device are
used, and that the conditions are suitable for that purpose. This would require the use of upstream level
measurements together with components such as
thin-plate orifice
thin-plate weir (rectangular and V-notch)
Crump weir
critical-depth flume.
These require routine attention to maintain their performance, but this is normally no more than
removing any accumulations of sediment that may affect the hydraulic behaviour
brushing the surfaces to remove slime and algae.
Thin-plate orifices and weirs can sometimes develop leakage problems and also require occasional
renewal or refurbishment if their performance is starting to be affected by a loss of true edges, compliant
with the requisite standards.
Further information on flow measurement structures is given by Ackers et al (197), Bos (199) and
in the relevant British Standards.

Landscape
This chapter discusses landscape within the context of SuDS design and
its overarching design principles.
Chapter 10 provides further discussion related to the design of SuDS in an urban context.
Chapters 11–23 provide guidance on the engineering and technical design issues
related to landscape and planting for different types of SuDS component.
29.1 INTRODUCTION
The term “landscape” encompasses the entirety of all external space, whether urban
or rural. Considering the character and qualities of the existing landscape, and the way
in which new elements or development are assimilated within this greater landscape
allows them to be designed appropriately from concept to detail.
The design of the landscape element of SuDS is a critical part of its delivery, both in
functional and aesthetic terms. Depending on the scale and location of a site, hard
or soft landscape elements may comprise almost the totality of the drainage system,
provide a range of specific components, or may be limited to just one or two particular
uses. Regardless of this, the same attention to detail is required in designing both the
hard and soft landscape as is required of the engineering.
To achieve the optimum result that allows landform, hard materials and soft landscape
to play their roles in delivering the Management Train, and particularly the amenity
and biodiversity elements, the landscape architect should have a fully integrated role
within the design team. Where a scheme is predominantly a “soft” planted system, the
landscape architect or landscape manager, may play the leading role.
However, this should be determined on a project-by-project basis, the most important
factors being the need for effective communications within the design team and a
shared vision over the design and its delivery. This will help ensure that multi-functional
benefits can be achieved, because integrated design is most effective when it is
an inherent part of the site master planning process (Chapter 7). For example, the
production of a planting and management plan for an unsympathetically engineered
balancing pond does not fulfil the ethos of integrated SuDS or its design criteria.
Design of the landscape should include:
assessment of the value of existing trees or habitats for retention, and their
protection throughout the project
consideration of landscape/townscape character, both of the site itself and its
broader setting
understanding the requirements of the users in terms of access, circulation and
their intended use of the site
appropriate responses to the site constraints and opportunities, including slopes
and gradients, soils and aspect, and how levels relate to the buildings and the
intended use of the open areas
review of a range of potential solutions and the way that hard and soft solutions
can be effectively integrated to meet the site’s requirements
Chapter 29: Landscape

agreement over the extent of land needed for soft elements
agreeing capital and maintenance costs
addressing health and safety factors, and maintenance requirements.
Landscape architecture or design encompasses both the hard and soft elements of the natural and
built environment. These should be designed together, if they are to work most effectively and to
achieve a visually harmonious result. The SuDS should therefore be integrated within the greater
landscape concept in its entirety, so that the range of hard landscape and paving materials (their
functional properties, scale, colour, texture and use) is used consistently around the site, in a way that is
complementary to those used for any buildings on the site. Elements that may be specific to the SuDS,
such as railings, fencing, headwalls and signage, should similarly be considered as an integral part of the
overall design palette.
29.1.1 Objectives for a landscape scheme
A comprehensive SuDS landscape plan should therefore consider the extent to which it can achieve the
following objectives
Desin for effetie attenuation o ontrol an eeeane
A wide range of soft landscape features can be used to provide space for infiltration or attenuation
storage.
While flow control measures will usually require hard structures (Chapter 28), where these are above
ground, they should be designed in an attractive manner as part of the overall landscape, using locally
appropriate materials. However, ground form can also be used, and densely vegetated surfaces on
shallow gradients can significantly slow flows through their hydraulic roughness.
All schemes should consider exceedance flows, and these can often be channelled through soft
landscape areas (ideally grassland) via shallow and subtle ground modelling.
Imroe ater uality
A wide range of water quality improvements can be achieved by using vegetated surfaces as part of the
Management Train (Chapter 26). Grass is particularly effective at dealing with sediments and pollution
where sheet flow is used, and planted components that dry out between each rainfall event are an
efficient means of promoting bioremediation. However, planting and grassland generally can be used to
provide a wide range of water quality improvements by providing good erosion protection to banksides
and slopes, optimising silt interception and minimising resuspension, and providing a bioremediation
substrate for the treatment of pollution.
roie an attratie ne feature in te loal lansae
The aesthetic appeal of a SuDS component or scheme is an important part of its public and social
acceptability (aters an ). This can be achieved using carefully considered ground contouring,
planting and the design of both the hard landscape and open water features. The overall layout, planting
and ground modelling can be used to create or restrict views of attractive features, both within and
external to the site or to screen unsightly elements.
An understanding of the local urban/landscape character, and both its positive attributes and detractors,
should also inform the design process to ensure that the new feature is locally appropriate.
Imroe eoloial funtion an ioiersity
SuDS introduces the opportunity for adding or enhancing wetland habitat (Chapter 6), which can
increase a site’s biodiversity potential, particularly where habitat creation includes new features such as
damp wetland or permanently wet areas already. Enhancing biodiversity requires that a variety of habitats
are provided within a site, incorporating new, ecologically appropriate features.
632 Part E: Supporting guidance
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Wherever natural habitats of value exist, these should be preserved and should only be incorporated
within SuDS schemes where there are no risks to their ecological status, and they are compatible with the
SuDS and a clear benefit will be achieved.
It is essential that the right soil and ground conditions are provided related to the habitats to be created,
and that the establishment and maintenance specification for the planting recognises any specific
requirements (particularly seasonality) or horticultural operations for doing so.
se lan effiiently an enane lan alues
The use of soft landscaped SuDS within a site can allow the efficient use of land by providing multi-
functional uses, where, for example, permanent ponds with a storage function can become attractive and
biodiverse landscape features (aters an ).
Provided that the design and scale of these SuDS components fit appropriately within an area of public
open space (POS), they can form part of the general POS requirement. However, visually dominating
or fenced engineered ponds are unlikely to form part of a POS requirement; indeed, they may be
unacceptable to the local authority and will not provide multi-functional landscapes.
Small-scale SuDS components, such as rain gardens, can be incorporated within gardens, and provide
both Interception and attenuation to at least the 1:1 year requirement, and potentially to 1:30 years or
more, thereby reducing the storage requirement further down the system.
Sites with good quality landscape schemes are known to enhance public health and wellbeing, as well as
increasing land values and improving their saleability, with housing developers reporting that properties
facing onto SuDS sell quicker and/or for higher values than the same properties elsewhere. Conversely,
poor landscape can contribute to a poorer quality of life for residents, and contribute towards the value of
the site falling.
All landscape should have a clear, effective and practical design and management plan to allow the
benefits to be maintained in the long term.
ssess ris an reet te resonse itin te esin
The risk inherent in open water features should be assessed for each site individually (Chapter 36) and
the appropriate measures incorporated within the design.
Simple design principles around good sightlines into water areas, shallow gradients at the water line and
defensive planting can contribute much towards reducing risk.
Maintenance operations should also be considered to ensure that any machinery necessary for both
routine and periodic maintenance is able to access the SuDS easily and safely.
29.2 LANDSCAPE CHARACTER
Landscape character identifies and describes the specific character of each landscape, that is the unique
combination and pattern of elements and features that makes each distinctive to its local area and
different from others.
Landscape character areas have been mapped at a regional, district and local scale, along with
seascapes, the description of which also shows how the landscape is perceived, experienced and valued
by people. National Character Areas (Natural England, 2012) can be downloaded from their website.
County or local character assessments are available on-line from local planning authorities.
Understanding what makes a landscape locally distinctive should be a fundamental part of determining
new interventions or designing within it for new development it may have been the subject of a landscape
and visual impact assessment. The character and visual quality of SuDS in rural and semi-rural
Chapter 29: Landscape
633
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
landscapes should be carefully considered, as poorly conceived designs can form alien or unnatural
features, out of character with the local landscape. This can be particularly true of ground modelling,
where modelling is viewed against the skyline, or where the local topography is naturally steep or shallow.
Similarly, planting will require careful consideration.
The rationale for how and why the SuDS landscape design has been developed, and the way it responds
to landscape character, should form a key part of the design and access statement accompanying
any planning application, and should support the way that these principles have been applied to the
landscape more generally.
29.2.1 Urban and suburban considerations
While landscape character descriptions apply to the wider landscape rather than urban areas, the
principle of understanding the local vernacular, its character and the historic, cultural and social
influences on an area, should influence design wherever it is located.
Information on townscape character can be found within local authority documents, such as townscape
assessments, conservation area statements, village design statements or development briefs for
individual sites.
Understanding the vernacular, particularly in relation to hard materials, their methods of use and locally
typical planting should form an important design consideration. This does not undermine the designer’s
desire to create something modern or in contrast to the local vernacular, but it should be informed by a
thorough understanding and appreciation of it. In many instances, creating a positive design statement
that is well informed by local influences can contribute to enhancing local distinctiveness and identity (see
also ater ).
29.3 SITE CONSIDERATIONS
Achieving an attractive and functional soft SuDS scheme is dependent on fully understanding the site’s
character: the conditions of slope, gradient, ground modelling, geology and soils, and natural drainage
patterns alongside the value of retaining existing natural site features such as trees, hedgerows or
areas of important habitat. The character of the site itself should also be considered in the context of the
surrounding land uses or landscape.
Preliminary understanding the characteristics of the site should be undertaken at the conceptual
design stage, as described in Section 7.6.1. More detailed assessment and design approaches will be
undertaken as the design progresses through outline and/or detailed design (Setions an .
29.3.1 Existing natural features on site
Existing natural features on site may include trees or hedgerows, or habitats of ecological value. Where
the site will be subject to development, and such features potentially affected, they should be subject to
the appropriate survey, which should inform the design and development process. Initial checks should
be made with the local planning authority to ascertain whether such features are already covered by
protective designations:
trees – by either individual or group tree preservation orders (TPO), or automatically by virtue of
their being located within a conservation area
eeros – may come within the scope of The Hedgerow Regulations 1997
aitats the site may be designated as a site of special scientific interest (SSSI), site of
importance for nature conservation (SINC), local nature reserve or may contain protected species.
istin trees on site should be subject to a pre-development tree survey in accordance with BS
572012, and this should be undertaken by a competent person, as defined by the standard. The
634 Part E: Supporting guidance
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
outcome of the survey should be recorded on an accurate topographic survey with accompanying
schedules, recording all the trees or tree groups, their species, height, spread, girth, current condition,
likely useful life expectancy and an assessment of their value for retention from A to C. Trees in very poor
condition are classified as U, and consideration should be given to measures for their removal or for them
to be made safe. The survey also establishes the root protection area for each tree, which should not be
damaged by excavation or building works without prior agreement. All grade A trees should be retained,
as many grade B as possible and grade C trees if so desired.
istin eeros should be surveyed for their continuity, quality and species mix, and graded in line
with guidance from Defra (2007).
istin aitats should be subject to a phase 1 habitat survey. Where protected species are either
present or assessed as being likely to be present, then further detailed species-based surveys should
be undertaken to inform the location of any development works and necessary mitigation measures.
Such works may be subject to a licence from Natural England. Surveys can only be undertaken at the
appropriate time of year, and the timings vary depending on the species involved.
All features to be retained should have appropriate protective fencing (or other measures) as per the
relevant guidelines, put in place before any works commences, and should be retained intact for the
duration of the works or as specified in any licence. Some works may also be restricted during certain
months of the year to prevent undue disturbance to wildlife.
29.3.2 Gradients and ground modelling
Successfully integrating SuDS invariably requires areas of ground modelling to accommodate swales,
bioretention areas, detention basins, or larger permanent wetlands, ponds and lakes as well as general
regrading for the built development. On development sites excess fill may also need to be reprofiled within
areas of public open space adjacent to the SuDS to balance the overall cut and fill operation.
Integration of the proposed landform, therefore, requires the ground form beyond the SuDS component
to be considered, and its contouring adjusted to allow the levels to flow around and into it, in a naturalistic
manner that is visually attractive, and accords with the local surrounding landscape. Features should be
located to fit within the landscape and its natural contours, noting that the largest features will invariably
be found towards the downstream end of the site.
Slopes at constant gradients tend to look over-engineered and unnatural, when used in naturalistically
designed schemes, unless such slopes are locally typical. Therefore, consideration should be given to where
these can be made more variable, without undermining the performance or safety of the SuDS component.
Overly steep slopes may create adverse impacts on the character of the landscape or visually, if the
features are of sufficient sie or create a notably alien feature. Slopes steeper than 1 in may require
stabilisation through bioengineering (or other means), dependent on the height and the strength of
the superficial geology. In such cases, advice should be sought from an engineering geologist or
geotechnical engineer. Ideally a range of gradients should be used that reflect the natural landform
outside the feature, while internally they should be used not only to create variety to the banks, but also
to develop areas around the base and its edges that will encourage a more diverse range of species.
Wetland and aquatic plants naturally colonise in a relative narrow range of (normal) water levels, so that
even slight variations in level will encourage greater plant diversity.
Banks on the “downward” side of ponds, where water is being held above natural ground levels should be
avoided where possible and can be the most difficult to assimilate successfully, so that these slopes may
require extensive planting to help mask their inherently unnatural qualities. The top and toe of slopes also
require extra space to allow a more gentle transition between the slope and the adjacent ground.
Gradients around permanent water bodies should respect health and safety requirements for shallow
slopes at the water line and safety benches (see Chapter 36). Changes to landform should also respect
the protected root protection ones of trees to be retained as defined in the tree protection plan, and

set-off distances of (ideally) m to the centreline of retained hedgerows. Maintenance requirements for
access should also be considered.
29.3.3 Soils
Natural soil is a precious, expensive and limited resource, and should be treated with the necessary care
to enable it to be stored and reused on site in good condition. Defra (2009) deals with the assessment,
handling and management of soils, but generally the following key issues should be addressed:
Unwanted existing vegetation on areas to be stripped and stored should be cut down and/or sprayed
out with contact herbicide before stripping.
Topsoil and subsoil should be stripped and stored separately and should not be compacted.
Wet soils should be stockpiled no higher than 2 m, and ideally 1.5 m, in linear rows with the top and
sides profiled to shed water (Defra, 2009).
Dry soils can be stockpiled higher and the stockpile surface should be compacted to seal it from wet
weather (Defra, 2009).
Stockpiles should be sown with a clover mix if they are to be left for more than six months before use, or
any weeds that grow should be regularly sprayed with herbicide to prevent the build-up of weed seeds.
Stockpiles should be protected from contamination by rubbish, rubble or building operations,
particularly chemicals or leachate from site works.
Soil should only be stripped, stored or spread in appropriate weather conditions, and operations
ceased if the ground is waterlogged, or during periods of heavy rain.
Before spreading subsoil or topsoil, the ground should be prepared by clearing any existing weeds
(if spreading subsoil, then strip any topsoil first), and ripping through the soil to allow good cohesion
between the existing and new soil. Soil should be spread in layers no greater than 300 mm depth (HA,
1981 and Defra, 2009) and lightly consolidated, not compacted. A degree of natural settlement should be
anticipated when setting finished levels, so tolerances in specified levels should reflect this.
29.3.4 Contaminated soils
While contaminated land is dealt with in Chapter 8, contamination should be considered in terms of its
potential impact on both humans and plants. Some contaminants will radically affect the development
of plants, but may be sufficiently remediated by soil treatment and/or the use of fertilisers and organic
composts. Alternatively, a capping layer incorporating a layer of clean soil (and possibly a geomembrane)
may be required between the contaminated ground and plants, to prevent uptake of the contaminants.
However, this is a specialist area, and detailed and comprehensive soil sampling will be required. Advice
should be sought from a soil or landscape scientist, with expertise in plant establishment as well as
contaminated land professionals.
29.3.5 Compaction and soil condition
Before undertaking any groundworks on site, all trees to be retained should have their protective fencing
erected at the recommended distance as determined in the tree protection drawing (as defined in BS
5837:2012), to avoid damage to either the tree’s canopy or root system (Section 29.3.1).
Soil compaction is very common on development sites (Chapter 31), and can inhibit or even prevent plant
growth and reduce the soil’s ability to infiltrate and percolate water. Heavy machinery can create solid
pans or glaed surfaces between soil layers, which act as impermeable barriers to both water and root
growth. Soil surfaces should, therefore, be ripped (with a three-tine subsoiler or chisel plough if space
allows (Figure 29.1), in transverse directions, or thoroughly loosened with an excavator fitted with a ripper
tine attachment on small sites) before the spreading of subsoil and/or topsoil, and the whole soil profile
re-ripped on completion before final cultivations. The depth and route of any underground utilities should
be taken into account during these operations.

29.3.6 Utilities and other site infrastructure
The location of existing utilities and other site infrastructure should be considered when designing SuDS,
and the location of any new services co-ordinated to avoid potential conflict with the proposed SuDS.
Piped water from a SuDS component should run below any existing services, and any “at ground level”
features, such as a pond or swale, are unlikely to be permitted above services, so this will require
discussion and approval from utility companies.
Existing underground services are particularly challenging in retrofit projects. Asset databases of buried
infrastructure should not be considered as definitive and should be checked with surveys.
29.4 BIOENGINEERING
The use of bioengineering techniques and a wide range of soil reinforcement treatments on the banks
of watercourses can be useful to help deliver effective SuDS. They can be particularly effective for bank
stabilisation adjacent to watercourses subject to occasional high or fast flows, or soil retention on steep
slopes, although these should be avoided if located immediately adjacent to a proposed SuDS or water
body (Chapter 36). Steeper gradients may, therefore, be required as part of an overall SuDS to allow
shallower gradients by the water’s edge.
Bioengineering allows the integration of soft landscape with the durability benefits provided through below-
ground engineering to help achieve and maintain watercourse formations in their designed form. Solutions
can include geotextiles, cellular confinement systems and vegetated barrier structures, which can achieve
a far softer and natural solution than hard landscaping features, such as sheet piling or concrete banks.
Gabions can also be considered, although the effect will not be of a completely soft system.
29.4.1 Developing technology
Products in this area are continuing to develop, so an on-line review of potential products and
applications is advisable. At present, the range of soil retention solutions varies from natural materials,
such as coir fibre, faggots and rocks, to manmade materials. The choice of material used will be site
specific and dependent on its application, whether the system is necessary to aid establishment of the
SuDS or whether it is required as part of its long-term durability and performance, with materials to aid
establishment generally tending to be biodegradable.
Generally, natural materials are likely to be most suitable for shallower banks and lower water flows,
accommodating stability for initial plant establishment to stabilise the banks themselves. Where banks are
steeper or are subject to higher flows or greater velocity, durable manmade products may be better suited
to providing more permanent stability.
29.4.2 Soil reinforcement
Different levels of reinforcement are needed, dependent on the steepness of slope, likelihood of exposure
to water erosion and type of vegetative establishment desired. Typical products are shown in Figure 29.2.
Chapter 29: Landscape
637
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
ellular onfinement systems consist of a flexible material forming honeycomb or diamond-shaped cells,
laid and fixed onto the bank, filled with soil and planted or covered with grass, and are also available in
larger forms, used as “blocks” to create a river bank. The cellular formation provides extra strength to the
top layer of soil and prevents it sliding downhill, making it suitable for use on steeper slopes (up to 1 in 1),
although much shallower slopes are recommended for use in SuDS. Due to the mesh sies, only young
small plants can be used if a planted bank is desired.
Turf reinforcement mat is a strong mat of fibre layers fixed onto slopes to be seeded or planted into,
offering further stability for plant establishment. This initially and permanently strengthens the bank,
which is then reinforced as the plants or grass establishes (up to 1 in 3 slopes). Preseeded mats are also
available.
einfore turf is pre-grown with an incorporated fibre mat to be unrolled and fixed onto slopes, which
provides an immediate result and is supplied in large rolls, which inherently provide a good initial degree
of durability.

29.4.3 Bank stability and erosion
Various products are available for use on banks to help stabilise soil structures, encouraging better
vegetative growth and this further improves bank stability and prevents erosion. While they are generally
used in larger river restoration projects, they are also likely to be useful at outfalls from SuDS to an
adjoining watercourse, or in retrofitting schemes where space is limited but a soft solution is desired.
Discussion of typical products is provided in Setion .
oir rolls an alletsmattresses help to prevent bank erosion, allow settling of sediment and facilitate
the stabilisation of banks through plant establishment. They are available with pre-established vegetation
or can be planted in situ.
o rolls prevent bank erosion, by acting as a crash barrier in front of the less stable natural soils
behind. Vegetation can establish within the rolls, aided by sedimentation. They are often used as a first
line of defence, in front of coir rolls, to avoid erosion by abrasion, providing greater longevity to the coir
rolls and a better environment within which the vegetation can establish.
Rock mattresses are often used to create new stream or river bases, giving a hard-engineered stability
with less detriment to the riverbank appearance. A range of rock or stone can be used to improve visual
quality, and where sedimentation occurs, planting can naturally establish over time. Consideration should
be given to ensuring that rock or stone is used that is typical of the local area, although it should also be
sufficiently durable for its proposed use. Rock mattresses and gabions can also be used on banks, to
offer protection from erosion, especially on the outer side of meanders, while also assisting with plant
establishment in faster flowing areas. These require careful design to ensure their successful visual
integration within the overall SuDS, although they are only likely to be required on very large schemes
with high flows.
ie illo reetments are generally used to edge or restore river banks, or to terrace them, so they are
only likely to be used for large-scale features. Once they are installed, the ground behind is backfilled and

can be planted, preventing erosion of the banks. While this approach is better for biodiversity, it may not
be suitable in areas of high velocity water flows. The site should also be suitable to accommodate willow
trees, both physically and visually, once they establish, and those managing the site, should be clear
about the maintenance and management that will be required.

29.5 TOPSOILS, AMELIORANTS AND MULCHES
The use and management of natural soils, or the potential use of “manufactured” soils as natural soil
becomes an increasingly scarce resource, should be considered. Soils are essential for good drainage
and should also provide the necessary nutrients for healthy plant growth to achieve rapid establishment
and ground cover desired for its function as part of the SuDS. This section principally relates to topsoils;
engineered soil (which can be used instead of topsoil) is covered in ater .
Chapter 29: Landscape
639
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
29.5.1 British Standards
BS 22015 specifies requirements for topsoils that are moved or traded. It is not intended (or
appropriate) for the grading, classification or standardisation of in situ topsoil or subsoil that is already
present on site. The standard classifies soil into two grades, multipurpose and specific-purpose topsoil.
As well as topsoil grading, the standard also provides guidance on soil sampling and analysis, as well as
handling and storage of soil.
ultiurose tosoil is capable of sustainably supporting grass, trees, shrubs, herbaceous plants and
other plantings, and is therefore suitable for the majority of landscape applications.
Seifiurose tosoils are topsoils that have low fertility or are acidic or calcareous, and are specified
when there is a particular specialist need. It should be noted that these soils are not appropriate for general
landscaping applications and are more suited to particular ecological applications where a specific soil is used
to obtain maximum biodiversity benefit, and therefore may be appropriate for particular SuDS applications.
When specifying topsoils, it is important to consider the predominant soil type in the locality and the
intended use of the site, so that the properties specified are compatible with the requirements of the soft
landscaping elements proposed. Wildflower areas require an impoverished (low phosphorus) soil with
preferably a low weed seed bank, so fertile topsoils and most “natural” topsoils are less favourable than
“manufactured” topsoils with a low seed bank.
etura assifiation of soi
Texture describes the mixture of different particle sies in soils, and names such as loamy sand and clay
describe the constituent mix. Soils can also be referred to as heavy (clay/silty) and light (sandy) to indicate
their ease of cultivation. Texture is a fundamental soil property which influences key aspects such as
drainage, water storage, workability and susceptibility to soil erosion and thereby its suitability for different
uses. It also plays a major part in defining the need and the strength of a soil’s structure. Structure is the
term used to describe the aggregation of soil particles (clay, silt, sand) into peds which can vary in sie
from small crumbs to large blocks.
The texture class of a soil is defined by its relative proportions of sand, silt and clay. The UK uses
a system of classification developed by the former Soil Survey of England and Wales (Figure 25.2,
Chapter 25). This is different from other classifications in use around the world.
Soil structure is more critical in heavy textured soils. Without a defined soil structure, clayey/silty soils
tend to be less permeable and porous than sandy soils and as a result offer limited opportunity for
infiltration within part of a SuDS scheme.
For further information on soil texture, see Natural England (2008).
29.5.3 Topsoil manufacture
Multipurpose topsoil for general landscape use can also be made from a mixture of compost, sand
and subsoil because manufactured soil provides a suitable alternative for sites where there are limited
amounts of natural topsoil present on site. The process can be suited to bigger schemes where the
economies of scale allow for blending of soils on site. Manufactured soils are a mixture of existing,
available materials (sometimes including remediated soils from previously contaminated ground), with
inorganic and organic materials such as PAS 1002011 compliant green compost, to create a general-
purpose or specific-purpose soil. Manufactured soils are also widely available to buy. Advice from a soil
or landscape scientist should be considered to ensure that soils are blended to achieve the desired plant
growth as well as being suited to the specific SuDS functions proposed.
PAS 100 is a specification established by the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP), for
composted materials produced by large-scale, licensed composting facilities that compost household
and garden waste into usable compost. The Landscape Institute and WRAP (2012) have also developed
another standard, specifically for landscape applications.
640 Part E: Supporting guidance
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
29.5.4 Use of fertilisers
Dependent on the quality of the topsoil being specified, certain fertilisers may be required, in order to
obtain a nutrient level within the soil that will facilitate healthy and sustained plant growth. Soil fertility
is represented scientifically by NPK values, which quantify the levels of nitrogen, phosphorus and
potassium within the soil, and are essential for healthy plant establishment and growth:
Nitrogen is an essential growth nutrient and is required for the growth of leaves and stems.
Phosphorus is essential for root growth and development.
Potassium performs an important photosynthetic function within the plant, while also promoting
flower and fruit development.
The nutrient value of a soil can be ascertained through an appropriate soil test (as specified within BS
22015) and specific fertilisers applied to restore a balance within the soil, ensuring that it will provide
suitable conditions for successful establishment of the various plants, trees and grass.
Generally, bulk fertiliser comprising organic material will be used for new planting, with inorganic fertilisers
of the appropriate NPK composition added to address any soil nutrient deficiencies. Inorganic fertilisers
are only required for grass establishment, and wildflower grass should receive no extra fertiliser treatment
(unless recommended through soil analysis due to either contamination or severe nutrient depletion).
Where fertilisers are used within SuDS, they should be worked into the soil during cultivation, rather than
scattered on the soil surface, to reduce rapid runoff.
Use of fertiliser in the context of a SuDS should give due consideration to potential contamination of the
receiving watercourse. Excessive or incorrect application of fertilisers can result in nutrients not being
taken up by plants at the point of application and being washed downstream where effects such as algal
bloom can occur in the SuDS themselves and/or the receiving watercourse. Slow-release fertilisers are
preferable to soluble fertilisers.
29.5.5 Use of mulches
Mulches are used to aid plant establishment, primarily by covering the soil with a layer of material, which
has the function of:
preventing weed seeds from germinating and thereby competing with plants for light, space, soil,
nutrients and moisture
reducing evaporation of water from the soil, particularly during summer months when there may be
prolonged periods without rainfall, but the plants are in active growth.
While soil evaporation is part of how SuDS function, this does not take priority during the plant
establishment period, as it is more important to encourage the plants to achieve a sufficiently mature sie,
so that they can contribute effectively to the functional and visual quality of the system. Once plants are
established, their ability to draw moisture from the soil outweighs any loss of evaporation from the surface
due to mulches.
In landscape schemes designed for amenity purposes, chipped or pulverised tree bark is commonly used
to mulch planting beds. However, within planting beds that are part of a SuDS, where there is a flow of
water across a planted area or which has an outlet above ground, bark should not be used, as it will float
down the system and accumulate around – or potentially block – the outfall. Similarly, beds mulched with
a loose material such as bark should have their finished levels carefully considered when they are located
adjacent to pervious paving, to ensure that the mulch does not wash off onto the paving.
Effective alternatives to bark mulch include gravels, pebbles or small rocks. Jute matting or other
biodegradable materials can also be considered, provided they are aesthetically appropriate and do
not break up into chunks that may block an outlet when they degrade. Such materials will need to be
Chapter 29: Landscape
641
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
pinned down into the soil with steel pins or wooden pegs, and will ultimately be covered by the plants
as they develop. These are particularly useful for plants that creep either by their roots, stolons or
below-ground rhiomes.
29.6 CHOOSING THE RIGHT PLANTS
Planting within SuDS should primarily ensure that the plants selected are suited to the conditions in which
they are going to grow, so that they will thrive and deliver the range of benefits required of them. In the
public’s eye, the quality of a scheme will be judged on its aesthetics, but while this is an essential factor in
securing public support and acceptance for a scheme, it should be combined with functional suitability.
Primary consideration should be given to locally native species, and plants that benefit wildlife through
their nectar, fruit or berries. The extent to which they are used on any site will be dependent on the
purpose of the planting, its location and the requirements of both the local council through the planning
process and the expectations of the public. The planting designer will also wish to have their input to the
style and design of the planting.
Generally, the choice of plant species should reflect the usual design decisions relating to their location
in terms of aspect, sun or shade, height, form, colour, whether evergreen or deciduous, native or
ornamental, and soil factors such as pH, depth, nutrient status and organic content. However, the key
consideration has to be their ability to withstand the fluctuations in soil moisture that will occur. Planting
plans should be determined by landscape architects or others skilled in detailed planting design.
29.6.1 Restrictions and use of planting
The use of planting may need to be restricted due to their potential impact on adjacent structures
although this primarily relates to tree planting. The use of root barriers should be considered in relation to
the proximity of trees to buildings, as well as guidance from the NHBC (1995), regarding soil types, tree
species and foundations depths, although the coverage of species is limited.
Generally, the following constraints should be taken into account:
Consideration should be given to the depth of soil within any lined system to ensure that it is
sufficient for the plants or trees intended to grow there, and to avoid damage to the liner.
Trees (or shrubs that ultimately grow to the sie of small trees) should not generally be planted on
water-retaining earth embankments.
Trees should not be planted close to the inlet, outlet or other drainage structures where their roots
may affect their structural integrity.
Willows and poplar in particular should not be planted close to structures, pipes, paving, lined pools
or water-retaining earth embankments. But they may be planted on the uphill side of natural ponds or
lakes where sufficient space allows.
Conversely, planting is frequently used as a low-level barrier at the water’s edge, as a measure to prevent
the public – particularly, young children – from inadvertently falling or walking into open water. Planting
should not obscure visual observation of the water (which can be important from both a safety and
aesthetic perspective) or act as a barrier to rescuing children, should they find a way through.
29.6.2 Invasive species
Invasive weed is a term used to cover a number of native and non-native plants. While invasive native
plants can quickly dominate sites, they are of much less concern than non-natives, that can significantly
impact on our native ecosystems as they spread rapidly, grow strongly and are difficult to control.
The Wildlife and Countryside Act 191 provides the legislative framework for managing non-native
species, as it is an offence under Section 14(2) of the Act to “plant or otherwise cause to grow in the wild”
642 Part E: Supporting guidance
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
any plant listed in Schedule 9, Part II, and doing so carries penalties of up to a 5000 fine and/or 2 years’
imprisonment. Listed plants considered of relevance to working in or near fresh water are as follows:
Japanese knotweed – Fallopia japonica
giant hogweed – Heracleum mantegazzianum
Himalayan balsam – Impatiens glandulifera
Australian swamp stonecrop – Crassula helmsii
floating pennywort Hydrocotyle ranunuculoides
creeping water primrose – Ludwigia grandiflora
parrot’s feather – Myriophyllum aquaticum.
Plants designated as invasive have in the past been notifiable to Defra, but they are now so widespread
that this requirement has been abandoned. However, while these plants may be found on a development
site, it is a criminal offence to allow them to “escape” its boundary, and they must be eradicated
in accordance with the guidance provided by the EA (2010). While all these plants cause major
environmental problems, giant hogweed can also prove dangerous to human health (poisonous sap from
leaf and stem hairs causes blistering and persistent skin pigmentation). Similarly, Japanese knotweed
must be eradicated before any construction or planting works, as it has the ability to regrow through
paving or concrete and can seriously damage construction works. As most development sites will be
subject to a Phase 1 Habitat Survey as part of the planning process, any such plants will be identified in
the ecologist’s report. Landscape professionals should also be able to identify Japanese knotweed, giant
hogweed and Himalayan balsam as a minimum.
Plants listed as invasive and methods for their treatment can be found in EA (2010). The RHS has also
produced a further list of plants from Schedule 9 that are now banned for use or sale at all RHS shows, as
many have been part of normal commercial plant production for many years <tttinyurlomoma>.
Those of particular relevance to avoid adjacent to water are
water fern – Aolla filiculoides
curly waterweed – Lagarosiphon major (or Elodea crispa)
water hyacinth – Eichhornia crassipes
water lettuce – Pistia stratiotes.
There are also a wide range of plants (both native and non-native) that if left unchecked will tend to
smother less dominant plants and reduce the planting scheme to a very limited number of species.
Invasiveness can also be a product of the space available for the plants within the SuDS, as a large pond
or lake may well be capable of supporting plant species that would dominate a smaller water feature, and
so success will be dependent on the horticultural knowledge of the designer, an understanding of the
SuDS component’s intended use and the anticipated level of maintenance it will need.
Some plants associated with water bodies that are considered potentially dominating are:
bulrush or greater reed mace – Typha latifolia
lesser reed mace – Typha angustifolia
common reed – Phragmites australis
greater spearwort – Ranunculus lingua.
It should be noted that invasive plants can be easily transferred from one site to another through seeds,
pieces of plant or contaminated water being transferred by humans or others. Methods to protect against
this are described in detail by the NNSS (2015).
Chapter 29: Landscape
643
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
29.6.3 Biosecurity
Biosecurity considers the threat to our native flora and ecology as a consequence of introducing disease
through plants, insects, viruses or other means. There has been wide public awareness of biosecurity
issues for many years since Dutch elm disease destroyed almost all mature elms within the UK. Since 2012,
Ash dieback (Chalara fraxinea) has been in the headlines, and over time the disease is expected to lead to
the loss of most of our ash trees and significant alterations to the landscape character of many areas.
Chalara is, however, only one of a rapidly growing number of pests and diseases threatening the urban
and rural landscapes of the UK, as there are pests, viruses or fungi that affect oak, willow, alder and a
wide range of other plants, although most are not fatal. Early government policy development around
Chalara has been heavily focused on forestry and woodlands, both in terms of the threats to production
and the impacts on ecology, although the effect will clearly be much wider.
Care is therefore needed in both the choice of plant material and its procurement, to ensure that it is free
from, or resistant to, all currently known diseases (some of which are only found is certain parts of the
country). A requirement for plants to be of UK provenance can be considered, but may not always be
possible to achieve. Imported plants pose the greatest risk, although government requirements for border
controls, alongside certification in the exporting country, are helping to address this problem. Recent
experience has also shown how some diseases are airborne and are therefore able to cross borders
despite a ban on importation. It is therefore essential that any species known to be at significant threat of
disease are not used within any new schemes until resistant strains are developed.
ant seifiation and urhasin
All plants should be specified in line with BS 96-11992, and using the National Plant Specification
(NPS) – a design software tool <oeliosou. This identifies a wide range of species that
are commercially available, and the sies in which they are normally grown. It is essential that planting
is specified in line with this document to ensure that it is likely to be commercially available. This is
particularly important where plant lists are included on drawings for submission to the planning authority.
While there are specialist nurseries for particular ranges of plants which it may be possible to specify,
care should be taken to ensure that these will be available in the numbers required at the time they are
needed on site, as many specialists do not produce large quantities of plants, so their plant lists can be
deceptive. Plants should always be specified using their full botanical name (in Latin), as common names
are too variable, and many plants do not have them.
The major nurseries generally participate in the Horticultural Trades Association Nursery Business
Improvement Scheme (replacing their old Nursery Accreditation Scheme) <tttinyurlomlots>,
working to ensure that nurseries are upholding standards of performance and product quality. Specifications
should generally state that all plants should be supplied by enrolled suppliers. This will ensure that the
nursery does not substitute alternative plant species or sies without prior agreement, and they should
produce good quality, disease-free plants. Many of the smaller nurseries may not be participating, but
provided their quality control and production are acceptable, they may well offer a more extensive range of
alternative plants.
Plants may be purchased all year round, but many aquatic plants are only available in any quantities as
“bare root” stock during May–July, and many will not be available during the winter. Woody plants are
also generally purchased as bare root stock in the dormant season over winter. Most damp species and
general landscape plants will be available throughout the year, although stock may be limited at the end
of the season. Advance ordering to secure a confirmed supply is recommended.
29.6.5 Selecting the right plants for SuDS
Consideration of the right plants for a SuDS will depend on two issues, over and above normal plant
selection procedures:
What is the moisture regime likely to be in the SuDS? This will determine the tolerance of plant
selected, and whether a dense rooting system is desirable.
644 Part E: Supporting guidance
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
What is the general water regime for damp or wet SuDS planting? This will depend on the frequency
of saturated conditions and the average depth of water.
ale illustrates the expected moisture regime by type of SuDS component, and the tolerance level
required of the plants.
It should be noted that there are many plants and trees suitable for SuDS that are tolerant of a wide range
of conditions.
The plant selection should also consider visual quality all year round. While large-scale water features will
contain elements that are herbaceous and die back each winter, or are deciduous, smaller scale features
in urban or suburban areas should contain a higher percentage of plants that are evergreen and those
with attractive winter features, such as interesting bark, catkins or berries. Grasses are useful as they
provide a dense creeping rootone that is resilient, weed proof and evergreen. Plant selection should also
consider the necessary maintenance requirements of the plants, and the level of funding/skill that will be
available to maintain them.
Planting design should be undertaken by a landscape architect, horticulturalist or other professional with
the appropriate skill and knowledge in planting.

29.6.6 Use of native plants
Native plants should form the backbone of any SuDS planting scheme because of their value in providing
habitat and increasing biodiversity. However, smaller-scale SuDS components in suburban or urban
areas may offer fewer opportunities for native planting, where year-round visual quality requires a higher
percentage of evergreen plants or where natives do not provide a sufficient range of smaller growing
plants. However, efforts should be made to include native plants in all schemes and, wherever possible,
to maximise their number.
The use of native plants, and ideally plants of native provenance, is particularly important for SuDS
components that discharge into natural water systems, owing to the risk of introducing further exotic (and
potentially invasive) plants into the natural environment. Where schemes outfall to a surface water or
combined sewer this is of lesser importance, and if a site manages water completely by infiltration, then
the risk of escapes is very low.
Biodiversity is discussed in detail in Chapter 6.
29.6.7 Establishment issues and natural regeneration
Natural regeneration should be considered as an appropriate method of plant establishment, as the
natural seed resource in the soil will reflect the local landscape’s plants, and what will grow there
naturally, although not necessarily within the SuDS. However, a balance may need to be struck between
the need for an immediate visual impact and allowing areas to regenerate. Wetlands establish particularly
quickly through natural regeneration, and plants will colonise those parts of the site to which they are
most suited. Management would then ensure that any unwanted or invasive species were removed. The
speed at which natural regeneration will occur will also depend on a number of factors:
nutrient levels in the soil
previous use of the ground and therefore
seed resource within the natural soils
proximity to an existing seed resource (even local ditches would provide a suitable seed resource)
use of direct seeding of parts of the wetland, and then allowing this to naturally seed other parts
(particularly useful if an area is being developed in phases)
Seed is spread naturally primarily by wind dispersal, but also by wild animals, insects and birds, as well as
on the boots of walkers. Damp areas can also be effectively established via a mix of natural regeneration,
wildflower seeding and some interplanting, which provides some immediate cover, but mainly relies on
regeneration. The techniques selected will depend on the time available for establishment, and when the
system needs to be fully functional, alongside the need for a level of visual acceptability for users once
access if provided.
Historically, a way to stimulate regeneration has been to introduce “bucketfuls” of mud taken from the
margins of existing ponds, which had the benefit of introducing beneficial microorganisms as well as plant
seed. However, the increasing problem of invasive species has severely limited this practice, owing to the
risk of their inadvertent spread. However, it may be considered appropriate where an existing pond has
been monitored and is known to have no invasive species, or where a new pond is being developed on an
existing site where the background of the pond’s ecology is known. Advice on this should be sought from
an ecologist, but, if in doubt, do not use this practice.
29.6.8 Establishment of plants
All planting operations should be specified in accordance with BS 96-10191, and the requirements
related to seasonality, weather and soil conditions, soils, fertilisers, bed preparations, use of fertiliser
and mulches, plant handling and planting and the use of all planting ancillaries, such as stakes, ties and
guards, should be clearly specified.
646 Part E: Supporting guidance
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
29.6.9 Defects liability for planting
All planting carried out under a formal contract – the best form suited for planting contracts being the JCLI
(2012) form of agreement should have a defects rectification period of 12 months, to ensure that the planting
has fully established through both its dormant and growing season. Contract conditions should require
that any plants that fail during at least the first year (barring vandalism or other exceptional reasons) will be
replaced free of charge by the landscape contractor. Where semi-mature trees are used, this period may
extend to 2–3 years. However, liability can only be enforced if the contractor who undertook the planting
is given responsibility for its maintenance during this establishment period. Where general construction or
engineering contract forms are used, appropriate clauses will need to be written into the contract.
29.7 GRASS
It is essential that areas of grass within a SuDS are established properly before being inundated with
water, as areas that do not have sufficient grass cover may suffer soil erosion, or damage may be caused
to the developing sward. The timing of the implementation of the SuDS is therefore key in determining
how the grass sward is best achieved, and whether any temporary diversion of surface water is possible
or practical until the grass is sufficiently well established to receive surface water. Grass areas that are
established early in the construction process, should be kept free of all debris or waste building materials
or site water contaminated by construction use.
29.7.1 Phasing and site considerations
Ideally grass areas would be sown and allowed to develop for 3–6 months in advance of being brought
into active use. However, space restrictions on site may mean that this is not practical. Seasonality will
also determine the constraints to producing the necessary grass cover. Ideal methods of growing grass
will also depend on whether an amenity grass area is required, or wildflower grass.
The cheapest option (and best if undertaken correctly) is to seed, and is economically the only practical
option on larger sites. However, grass can only be sown in the growing season when the soils are
sufficiently warm and damp to allow germination. While there are guidelines for sowing, these timings
may be reduced or extended in any year dependent on the actual weather conditions. Also note that
sowing in the middle of summer is likely to be highly dependent on very regular watering if the summer is
dry – but then if drought conditions are declared, watering may not be permitted.
ale identifies the constraints governing grass establishment and the options that may be considered.
Where early establishment of grass SuDS has not been possible, and they are required to be utilised fairly
soon after construction/planting, then consideration should be given to turfing (say) the base of swales, but
seeding the sides, above anticipated normal water levels. Where wildflower grass is desired (but wildflower
turf is not affordable), amenity turf can have wildflowers plugged into it once established, while seed from
adjacent wildflower areas will gradually seed in naturally if the site conditions are suitable.
29.7.2 Selecting the right seed mix
A wide range of seed mixes are available, and turf can also be grown to the individual producer’s
own seed specification. Advice can be sought from the suppliers related to soil type, pH, moisture,
whether sited in sun or shade and the proposed use. Low-maintenance mixes that require less cutting
may be appropriate, or specific sports mixes for detention basins intended to be used for field events.
Consideration should also be given to seed provenance, particularly for wildflower mixes, to ensure that
the species mixes are suitable and of native origin.

29.7.3 Amenity grass
Amenity grass may be used in situations where occasional inundation is planned, such as swales or
grass detention basins. Here, it is expected that any standing water will drain away within 24–48 hours.
A standard robust amenity mix is therefore likely to be adequate. Mixes containing finer turf grasses
are generally less likely to be able to withstand repeated inundation. Turf can be supplied as individual
turves or in larger rolls. Local supplies of cultivated meadow turf (meadows that have been sprayed with
herbicide to kill most field weeds) are generally available, but this is much more variable in its quality,
although it is often sold as a cheaper alternative.
Widoer rass
A range of wildflower grass seed mixes are commonly available. Care should be taken in the provenance
of wildflower seed, as much seed is produced abroad, and is not necessarily suitable for use within the
UK due to its impact on our native flora see also Section 29.6.3 on biosecurity. Mixes are generally a
combination of grass and wildflower seeds, and can be selected to reflect the type of habitat required,
existing species, the soil pH and the likely degree of inundation it will receive. Wildflower seed can also
be purchased without grass seed, but these tend to be for specific applications. Wildflower seed mixes
should reflect existing species. Custom-designed seed mixes can also be produced for sites if there is a
particular plant ecology that is required. Such mixes may have been proposed by the ecologist as part of
a Phase 1 Habitat Survey, on sites where this is appropriate, or may be developed to reflect the typical
species mix in local meadows.
Almost all wildflower grass is produced from seed, but turf can also be bought. This is relatively costly,
but may be appropriate in specific locations, although this is only available from a few specialist suppliers.
Previously, wildflower turf was lifted slightly thicker than normal turf, as it requires a greater depth to allow
the wildflower root systems to be cut and lifted without causing damage, but most turf is now grown on
plastic trays, which produces a strong mat of roots below the bottom of the turf. This encourages rapid
establishment, provided the turf is well watered.
Wildflower grass can also be created by overseeding and interplanting existing grass areas, but can
take several seasons to achieve. One of the main problems is that the existing grasses can be very
vigorous and may out-compete wild flowers. A method to reduce the vigour of established grassland,
is to introduce semi-parasitic plants such as Rhinanthus species (rattle), Euphrasia species (eyebright)
and Pedicularis palustris and P. sylvatica (lousewort). The most useful is Rhinanthus minor (yellow
rattle). In late summer or autumn seed is broadcast onto grass that has been cut short. As it is an
annual it can be eliminated from grassland in a year if prevented from seeding by cutting it down once
flower heads have formed.
29.7.5 Reinforced grass for access
Grass may be reinforced to provide a more durable surface for access. The presence or absence of a
mesh backing should be stated in the grass specification. It should be noted that some grass seed mixes
are also more suitable for heavy wear than others, and may be adequate on their own, dependent on the
anticipated frequency and weight loading. Amenity grass that is grown with a fine plastic mesh backing is
not considered to be “reinforced” – this assists in allowing turves to be cut thinner with less soil, and be
more able to withstand handling, but does not provide any structural reinforcement.
Reinforced grass is generally used:
to provide access for heavy machinery within SuDS where a continuous grass surface is required
to provide a permeable surface for parking
for areas of heavy foot traffic.
Further guidance on bioengineering for reinforced grass for use on banks and slopes is given in
Section 29.4.
Chapter 29: Landscape
649
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
The construction materials that provide structural stability for grass need a suitable substrate and turf,
or a seed mix that is appropriate for their particular reinforcement technique. Establishing a good quality
grass sward is particularly important, both to provide an attractive appearance, and to ensure that the
surface is sufficiently even for pedestrians. Typical reinforcement techniques are
rigid concrete or plastic units
flexible polypropylene cellular sheeting
plastic mesh
substrate containing mesh reinforcement fibres.
All of these options, with the exception of the plastic mesh, may require a sub-base layer, dependent
on the weight loadings anticipated, along with positive drainage as part of the sub-base design in
accordance with the respective manufacturer’s recommendations. Where sub-bases are used, the
amount of soil available in the cellular or rigid units is reduced to what can be provided within the
containment system alone. This can allow little space for the grass to root, and will make it more
vulnerable to drought. The nutrient supply for the grass will also be low and will require fertilising to
maintain a good quality cover.
The most important factor for establishment is creating a good friable seed bed. Hard-wearing grass
species should be used with an ability for the seed to adapt to changing circumstances with some degree
of drought tolerance, shade tolerance, tensile strength and binding abilities. Clover might be a useful
addition if the lawn needs to look after itself, as it enhances the ability of sward to withstand stress,
such as lower nutrient content. Use slow-release fertiliser in the seed bed and (at least) annually for an
established lawn where volume of substrate is low or likely to be of low nutrient status.
Generally seed or turf can be used for most reinforcement products, and the various parameters are
summarised in ale .
Where turf is used, it would ideally be grown on a soil with high sand fraction to ensure integration with
the substrate below.
29.7.6 Establishment
Wildflower areas require an impoverished (nutrient poor) soil, so topsoil should not be used as the main
substrate. Also note that if the soils are naturally very fertile (or are currently arable land), wildflower
meadows may not be appropriate, and would be very difficult to establish, and would require long-term
management to establish properly. Depending on the quality and condition of the subsoil, a skim of
topsoil may be required to provide a good quality tilth and to aid germination.
All grass is vulnerable to drying out and deterioration during the establishment period. Turf in particular should
only be imported to site in sufficient quantities that it can be laid as soon as possible after delivery, and should
be handled, stored and protected during this period. Watering will be essential during the establishment
period, unless the soil is already moist, and rainfall is expected. Areas should not be over-watered, as it may
wash out parts of the seed bed or may waterlog the turf, potentially damaging its root system.
29.8 DESIGNING FOR MAINTENANCE
While overall maintenance operations are dealt with in ater , maintenance considerations that influence
how a scheme is designed should be developed in tandem with the scheme. It is important that the principle of
who will maintain a site, and the anticipated resources likely to be available to do so, are anticipated from the
outset. As the soft landscape may be delivering part or all of the drainage for a site, this should be treated as
part of the site’s infrastructure, with the necessary operations planned accordingly. As the SuDS will normally
form part of a larger landscape scheme, the two elements should be completely integrated within the design,
and (ideally) maintained jointly to avoid any areas being missed or maintained to a different regime. Visual
quality and hydraulic performance should both be addressed within the management and Maintenance Plans.

29.8.1 Aligning the design for ease of maintenance
Enabling adequate access to the various parts of the SuDS for the equipment that needs to be used to
perform the maintenance, is a key design criterion, but one that is frequently forgotten. Where large-
scale equipment is required for works around inlets and outlets or other features, then dropped kerbs
and paved or reinforced grass landings will be required at strategic points from roadways, and ramps
down into basins may be required for larger detention basins. These should be sied to suit the sort of
equipment that will be required, including mowers for regular maintenance.
Understanding who will maintain a site can also influence design. Sites to be adopted by local authorities
may be subject to term contract maintenance agreements that will have specified maximum gradients
on which their equipment may be operated. These may typically be 1 in 5 or 1 in 6 slopes, which can
significantly affect the ground modelling or use of areas of closely mown grass around the SuDS.
Alternative options in this instance would be to use steeper gradients, but use planting or wildflower
grass. Bed layouts should be designed to ensure that the margins are sufficiently flowing to allow
machinery to mow easily around them. Where maintenance companies use a wide range of mowing
equipment, there is less need for such stringent considerations.
However, even with smaller mowing machines, grass banks can only be cut by ride-on or wide hand-
operated mowers up to 1 in slopes the maximum slope for any form of hand-operated equipment is
generally taken as 1 in , but this should be subject to risk assessment, which considers the capability of
the particular cutting machine. Cutting steeper slopes or banks is likely to require a tractor with a side-
arm flail, as pedestrian-operated machines are unsuitable. Domestic-scale rotary mowers and handheld
strimmers are unlikely to be practical for extensive areas of grass.
Chapter 29: Landscape
651
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Cutting grass can also only be done effectively when the ground is dry, so areas intended to be damp on a regular
basis should have the choice of surface vegetation carefully considered, as close mown grass is unlikely to be suitable.
There are restrictions on the use of chemicals adjacent to watercourses, so only approved herbicides or pesticides
should be used, and these operations should only be undertaken by those qualified in their use.
29.8.2 Management plans
Management plans for the first five years after planting are usually required as a standard landscape condition to a
planning consent, but these essentially cover establishment maintenance and do not address the issues of long-
term maintenance. Longer-term management plans should be established for all sites, but particularly where those
involved in its initial design and establishment are unlikely to have a longer-term involvement. This will ensure that
specific requirements related to how the SuDS function as a planted system will be identified within the plan.
Detailed guidance on the production of management plans is provided in ater . Generally, the overarching
aims and objectives should be established, and the plan worked through from the broader landscape setting
and its objectives, down to the detailed maintenance operations. Review of the performance of the SuDS and
the effectiveness of maintenance should be undertaken on a regular basis, and the plan reviewed in line with its
findings, bearing in mind the original overarching intention of the SuDS and the broader landscape in which it sits.

Materials
This chapter provides guidance on certain soils, aggregates and
geosynthetics that might be used in SuDS design.
Materials that are specific to a particular SuS component eg
bioretention soils subbase below pervious surfaces filter drain

Topsoil, subsoil and other landscape materials are covered in Chapter 29.
Guidance on good landscaping practice is discussed in Chapter 29.
30.1 INTRODUCTION
This chapter considers the following types of general materials or products that may be
used in SuDS:
soils and aggregates used as drainage layers or as engineered soils below
basins, filter strips, swales etc
geosynthetics geotextiles, geomembranes, erosion control products (including
products made with natural materials such as coir)
There are recognised and accepted specifications for most of the materials or
products, which have been developed over many years. It is preferable to use existing
specification clauses wherever possible, rather than having an array of different
bespoke specifications. There should be allowance within the specification to insert
site-specific, performance-based values for key properties.
A list of the most common materials used in SuDS and relevant chapters of this Manual
where further information on their use can be found is provided in Table 30.1.

30.2 STANDARDS AND CERTIFICATION SCHEMES
The Construction Products Regulations cover all materials used on construction sites that have a
harmonised European standard (hEN), including the use of aggregates and geosynthetics in SuDS. If a
product is covered by an hEN, it must meet the following requirements
The product must be CE (Conformit Europene) marked.
The product must have a Declaration of Performance (DoP). This includes details of the product,
relevant hEN and information about its performance in relation to the essential characteristics
defined within the harmonised technical specification. Note that datasheets are not CE controlled
documents and the DoP is the definitive product performance document.
Testing of materials and products should use test methods published by the Comit Europen de
Normalisation (CEN). These test standards are given a British Standards (BS) designation and
published by the British Standards Institute (BSI). Test laboratories may be accredited for each
specific test they undertake. One accreditation service is the UK Accreditation Service (UKAS),
and they provide a list of accredited laboratories on their website and the tests that are covered
<http://tinyurl.com/phfhzyc.
CE products should be delivered with an accompanying CE certificate or made available for
immediate electronic download (available in law to the customer but not anyone else such as a
designer where he is not the purchaser).
Some products may not be covered by harmonised product standards (eg cellular confinement systems
used for tree root protection and surface erosion control mats) and therefore do not have to be CE
marked. However, it is possible to voluntarily CE mark a product not covered by an hEN by using a
European Technical Assessment (ETA). This is an approval based on testing carried out to an agreed
level with the notifying body.
In practice, manufacturers or suppliers declare a defined set of properties of a product, as required in the
relevant European Standard, plus any additional characteristics that have been measured and/or verified
following a documented procedure.
656 Part E: Supporting guidance
30.3 TABLE
30.2
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
CE marking is a self-certification scheme that indicates that a product conforms to relevant European
Commission Directives and that the properties match those published by the manufacturer. It will allow
checks on site to determine the manufacturing origin of the product and its batch number and offers the
opportunity to request the factory quality control data for that batch of material. By providing a DoP, the
manufacturer assumes legal responsibility for the conformity of the product to the relevant hEN.
CE marking should not be used on its own to determine if a product is suitable for a given application. It
is an indication of quality control during manufacture, but it is no guarantee that a product is right for any
given application. For example, a damp-proof membrane can have a CE mark, but it does not mean that
it is suitable as a waterproof membrane below the sharp aggregate of a permeable pavement. Further
information on the requirements of CE marking is provided by the British Standards Institute (BSI, 200).
Fitness for purpose can be assessed by third-party accreditation. However, third-party accreditation
certificates (eg British Board of Agrment BBA) should also be used in an appropriate way. Simply
asking for a product with a BBA certificate does not give adequate assurance that a product is suitable
for a particular use. The BBA certificate should be checked for each specific application to make sure
that the requirements in the certificate are being followed during installation (eg many BBA certificates for
membranes specify the use of protection layers to prevent damage) and that the designer’s requirements
are being met.
GENERIC APPROACHES TO MATERIALS SPECIFICATION
The three most commonly used specification documents are summarised in Table 30.2.
ommon used seifiations
Seifiation Comments
National Building Specification
(NBS)
refers to the SHW for many earthworks materials and aggregates
not necessarily performance based and allows reference to specific
products and manufacturers’ references
available at a cost
well established and widely used by engineers, architects and landscape
architects.
Specification for Highway
Works (SHW) (HA, 2005a)
can be freely downloaded
recipe or performance based
well established and widely used by highways authorities and many
developers and engineers not commonly used by landscape professionals
provides a robust specification for drainage, earthworks and pavement
materials NBS uses the SHW as a reference for many of these items
generally updated every quarter.
Civil Engineering Specification
for the Water Industry (CESWI)
(WRc, 2011)
performance- and recipe-based specification (does not refer to specific
manufacturers)
available at a small cost
well established and used in civil engineering contracts let by water
companies across the UK.
None of these currently include specific clauses for SuDS construction. However, they do contain clauses
for most of the common construction activities and materials used in SuDS, or provision for including
them. The different items required for SuDS will be found in different parts of each of the standard
specifications, but this is not unusual for any item of construction. For example, if specifying materials for
a car park surface and drainage using the SHW, the designer would call upon several different parts of
the SHW (HA, 2005a), eg Series 500 (HA, 2009a), Series 600 (HA, 2009b), Series 700 (HA, 2009c) and
Series 000 (HA, 2009d). HA (2005a) will, in turn, reference various other standards as necessary.
Chapter 30: Materials
657
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
The following principles should be followed when preparing specifications for SuDS
The specification should be performance- or recipe-based (never both for the same property) and should
avoid the requirement to use products from a specific manufacturer, unless absolutely necessary. The
designer should be able to provide justification for any particular specification requirement.
The specification requirements should consider the construction phase and maintenance phase
of SuDS.
Performance requirements should be based on site-specific estimates of requirements. They should
not be a repeat of values from a single manufacturer’s literature.
Wherever possible, the specification clauses should reference relevant British/European standards.
Any of these specifications can be adapted to include the specification clauses for specific SuDS
components. An important consideration is that those involved in a project are familiar with the particular
specification being used and that standard documents are subject to change outside the user’s control.
The version of a document being used should be stated, and users should regularly check for changes
and updates to specifications.
Specifications should also take account of the Construction Products Regulations 201 (Section 30.2).
30.4 SOILS AND AGGREGATES
Soils and aggregates are used in SuDS as drainage layers, storage layers or as general engineered
soils below basins, filter strips, swales etc. If recycled materials are used, they need to meet the same
specification requirements plus any additional requirements for the particular material. WRAP provides
guidance on quality protocols for the use of recycled materials in construction projects (WRAP, 201).
30.4.1 Aggregates for drainage layers and trenches
BS EN 1222002 defines aggregates that can be used in unbound granular materials, which will include
drainage layers or filling for drainage trenches. The document provides aggregate properties, category
ranges and methods of test that apply to any aggregate type satisfying BS EN 122. Specifications
will need to define suitable categories for properties that are relevant to the particular end use. There is
a guidance document available that explains how to apply BS EN 122 for aggregates, and provides
recommended categories for different end uses.
Standard materials are defined in terms of the lower and upper particle sies. For example, 20 mm single
sie material is defined as 10/20 (the minimum particle sie is 10 mm and the maximum is 20 mm).
Aggregates used as drainage layers or in trenches need to be sufficiently permeable to drain water through
them and may also be required to store water temporarily. The volume of air voids between aggregate
particles in a layer of material will be important, because this is where water is stored or conveyed.
Permeability can be severely affected by the percentage of fines ( 0.06 mm), for example 5 fines can
in some instances decrease permeability by 95 depending on the overall grading of the material. If the
drainage layer is to be used to support traffic, the aggregate needs to be sufficiently strong and durable to
prevent it from breaking down into smaller pieces. Commonly used materials are set out in Table 30.3.

Drainage application Commonly used materials
Drainage layers
Coarse graded aggregate /20 and /0 as defined in BS 75-12009 see
Chapter 20, Table 20.13. This table specifies particle sie distribution (or grading),
There are a number of other important properties that are defined in BS 75-1
including resistance to fragmentation, resistance to wear, durability, shape, water
absorption and leaching of contaminants.
Type sub-base (as defined in the SHW) see Table 20.13. Note that this is an
aggregate that is defined in BS EN 1252010), and as this is not a harmonised
standard, products that meet its requirements are not required to be CE marked
at present.
Both materials are suitable for use as storage layers below trafficked areas, provided that
the overlying pavement and the drainage layer are designed to support the necessary
loads. The resistance to fragmentation and resistance to wear of aggregates can be
determined using Los Angeles and micro Deval tests, as described in BS 75-12009.
The water absorption and magnesium soundness properties are also important to
assess degradation in freeing conditions.
Drainage trenches Type B filter drain material, as described in Table 5/5 and Clause 505 of HA (2009a).
Permeability of materials can be determined using the method described in HA (1990).
The percentage of voids in an aggregate is used to estimate how much storage it will provide and is
called the porosity. Void ratio is often confused with porosity. The void ratio is the ratio of the volume of
voids to the volume of solids in a material. It is a different parameter but is related to the porosity by the
following equation
Void ratio n/(1 n)
where n is the porosity.
Normally a value of 0 is assumed for the porosity of most aggregates used to store water in SuDS (ie
1 m3 of aggregate can hold 0. m3 of water). Experience has shown that materials meeting the grading
requirements for coarse graded aggregate /20, /0 and Type sub-base have a porosity of at least
0. However, if a higher value is used in design, or other materials are used, tests to determine the
porosity of material delivered to site should be carried out to make sure that it meets the value used in
design. The tests should be undertaken on suitably compacted samples of the material. The compaction
and porosity should follow the test methods in BS 177-21990 and BS 177-1990 that are relevant
to the material being assessed. Care has to be taken when considering the porosity of materials with
a significant proportion of fine sand, silt and clay particles. For example, quoted values of porosity
for inorganic clays, silty clays or sandy clays of low plasticity vary from 291 (based on data from
Geotechdata.info, 201). However, water cannot move
in and out of these materials easily, because they have
a low permeability and they would not be suitable as a
storage layer. Therefore, the porosity should always be
considered alongside the permeability.
Construction of a drainage layer using /20 aggregate
is shown in Figure 30.1. The exposed drainage layer
is on the right-hand side and is partially covered by a
separation geotextile on the left-hand side. The picture
demonstrates the good housekeeping that is required
on site during construction to keep the drainage layer
free of mud or other debris that could clog it.

30.4.2 Engineered soils
A suitable depth of engineered soil can be used over the bottom of basins, filter strips or swales to
reduce waterlogging and improve the drainage characteristics of the basin. (Note that in BS 22007,
multipurpose topsoil can still be specified for banks of swales and basins, where planting is desired.) The
engineered soil will tend to be a greater depth than typical topsoil depths potentially replacing some of
the subsoil depth, where appropriate. The important properties of this engineered soil are as follows
sufficiently permeable to allow water to drain easily
having suitable properties and organic content to support plant growth.
An engineered soil will tend to be a sand-based medium with a narrow particle sie distribution, high
permeability and porosity, and reasonable reserves of organic matter and available plant nutrients. The
example specification for a bioretention filter medium provided in Chapter 18, Box 18.3 is a suitable soil
type that could be considered. Root one materials, that is a mix of sand and topsoil or green compost
(similar to that used in the construction of sports pitches), can often also be suitable. Any specification
that is used should be fully verified to ensure that it meets site-specific requirements in terms of drainage
performance and its function as growing media. In particular, the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the
soil should meet the design requirements for the drainage function.
30.4.3 Use of recycled and secondary materials as aggregates
Recycled materials can be used to produce aggregates for use in SuDS, provided that they have
suitable properties. They can be obtained at source from demolition (eg bricks and concrete), highway
maintenance (eg asphalt planings) and other works, or they can be bought from central processing
centres. The quality of the recycled aggregate is dependent on the quality of the original source materials
that are processed, and the processing that these materials undergo. All recycled materials must conform
with the relevant specifications.
Secondary materials are waste products from other processes or are manufactured from waste products,
for example blast furnace slag, recycled glass and recycled tyres.
The European standards for aggregates discussed above do not discriminate between different sources,
and are for “aggregates from natural, recycled and manufactured materials”. One of the most common
recycled materials is crushed concrete. When used in drainage layers or filter drain backfill, crushed
concrete should meet the same requirements as natural materials.
It is important that recycled materials will not degrade in service and will not leach pollutants into
surface water.
The use of recycled and secondary aggregates should comply with all relevant waste management
and other environmental regulations. Further information is provided on the AggRegain website
<http://aggregain.wrap.org.uk/>
30.5 GEOSYNTHETICS
There are many types of geosynthetics used in SuDS. These include geotextiles, geomembranes,
geocomposite clay liners and geocomposite drainage products. Erosion control products (eg products
made with natural materials such as coir) are also included in this section.
One of the main problems for designers is that different products often quote parameters obtained from
different test methods and from implementation within different components. This makes it difficult to
make objective comparisons of performance. This problem should reduce over time, as CE marking
(Section 30.2) drives the standardisation of test methods.

CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
30.5.1 Geosynthetic standards
European standards on geosynthetics are developed by the Technical Committee CEN/TC19,
Geosynthetics. International standards are developed by a similar committee ISO/TC 221 Geosynthetics.
The standards can be divided into those that apply to testing of geosynthetics and those that apply
to product applications. The main application standards that are likely to be relevant to the use of
geosynthetics in SuDS are summarised in Table 30.4. Application standards do not exist for all products
(eg cellular confinement products), but this does not prevent their use.
The product standards in Table 30.4 do not specify minimum requirements for properties, as these will be
related to the site specific application. However, they do identify which tests are required as a minimum
for particular applications. These are summarised in Tables 30.5 and 30.6, Section 30.5.2.
Example specifications for geosynthetics are provided by the International Geosynthetics Society (2006).

30.5.2 Laboratory testing of geosynthetics
Laboratory tests on geosynthetics can be divided into two classes
index tests
performance tests
Index tests measure properties that can be compared to the specification for a product, and help assess
variability between batches and compare different products. They cannot normally be used in design
calculations. Index tests include thickness, density and weight, tensile strength (measured using narrow
strip samples) and tear strength. They may be surrogates for other properties and can give an indication
of likely behaviour.
Performance tests are carried out to determine properties that can be used directly in design calculations,
such as wide strip tensile strength, interface friction, pore opening sie and permeability. Where
necessary, the tests should be undertaken using site-specific test conditions.
The properties in Table 30.5 have to be declared by manufacturers in accordance with the European
application standards discussed in Section 30.5.1. Table 30.5 identifies which test methods should be used.
Other properties that are not mandatory include determining the thickness of a geotextile (BS EN ISO
96-12005). This measurement is often necessary to allow the specification of a suitable geotextile for
a particular application.
For geomembranes and geocomposite clay liners used in SuDS as waterproof liners, results for the tests
in Table 30.6 should be declared, and the test methods used should also be stated. The table is based on
the application standard for canals, as this is considered to be most similar to the use of barriers in SuDS
(rather than reservoirs and dams).

eoteties as fitration and searation aers
The use of geotextiles as filters in SuDS may be required to achieve the following scenarios
1 filter silt from the runoff within a system (eg when placed as an upper layer within a permeable
pavement construction)
2 support the surrounding soil
provide a separation layer (eg to prevent finer soils washing into an underlying open void, such as a
pipe or tank, or coarser drainage layers)
a combination of the above (eg the geotextile around a soakaway will support the surrounding soil
and stop it collapsing into voids in the tank wall or any coarse aggregate backfill and also filter silt
from water running out of the tank).
Geotextile filters may occasionally be required to act as a filter for groundwater draining into the SuDS to
prevent soil fines being washed inwards, although this would be an exceptional design scenario.
The main design requirements are set out in Table 30.7.
Geotextiles can be manufactured as woven or non-woven materials. Woven geotextiles tend to have
relatively few openings of relatively large sie, whereas non-woven geotextiles tend to have many small
openings and are, therefore, more suitable for filtration applications. Non-woven geotextiles also offer
superior rates of perpendicular flow compared to woven geotextiles, unless woven geotextiles are made
with deliberately large openings.
TABLE
30.7
Geotextile design requirements
Property Design requirements
Permeability The geotextile should have sufficient permeability to allow water to pass through it at the
required rate. In SuDS design for scenarios 1, 2 and (above) permeability should be
considered the most important requirement.
Clogging prevention The geotextile should retain the required silt or soil particle sie without clogging. Normally
there should be no need to filter soil particles, because groundwater should not be flowing
into the SuDS, and the geotextile should simply be supporting soil in the unsaturated one
to prevent it collapsing into the SuDS.
Note There are various filter criteria used to assess the use of geotextiles as filters in other
applications. These are explained by Giroud (2000). Clogging of a geotextile is caused
by the retention of particles inside the fabric. A similar effect occurs by blinding, where
particles block individual openings on the upstream side of the fabric.
Geotextiles provide filtration where the geotextile is in good contact with a soil mass and the
water flows in steady state in one direction through the soil and then through the textile into a
void of some type. The steady flow and the soil structure ensure that only a minimal quantity
of soil particles is moved towards the textile in an initial four-week period, thereafter the flow
is only water. The textile is chosen with sufficient perpendicular permeability and an opening
sie such that the fine and medium soil particles can pass through the pores within the textile,
but the larger particles in the soil cannot. The soil structure ensures that the medium and fine
soil particles are held back within the soil and do not move towards the textile after an initial
flush. In that way, the textile has a very slight drop in performance initially, but thereafter is
not subjected to any more soil particles over the rest of its design life. Geotextiles have been
proven to work for an acceptable design life in filtration. There have been many equations
developed based on this theory. Each equation has its own interpretation of how to match
the soil particle sie to the geotextile pore sie. These filter criteria can be used in scenario
above, but are not applicable to any of the other scenarios.

TABLE
30.7
Geotextile design requirements
Property Design requirements
Clogging prevention The classic Teraghi stone filter and Giroud geotextile filter principles assume steady flow of
water through the soil and the geotextile. Soil particle movement is limited and consequently
a relatively long design life of the filter is attained. Conversely, when silt-laden water is
continuously presented onto a geotextile, silt particles will accumulate on the geotextile,
leading to reduced permeability and a relatively short, finite design life. The smaller the
opening sie and the greater the volume of runoff that is filtered, the shorter the design life
will be. There is also less risk of premature failure if the perpendicular permeability of the
silt-laden geotextile is less than the design flows.
Comparison of the silt sie in runoff with the opening sie of a geotextile can help designers
judge the likely rate of clogging in geotextiles used to filter silt from runoff (scenario 1),
although the variation in grading of suspended solids in runoff should be recognised and
eventually any geotextile for this application will clog.
Strength and
durability
The geotextile should be sufficiently strong and durable to withstand the forces applied to
it (eg within a permeable pavement construction, the geotextile can be subject to tearing
and puncturing due to the forces transmitted from vehicles braking and turning, and the
point loads particularly from very angular aggregates). This requires an assessment of the
puncture and tearing forces on the geotextile.
30.5.4 Geomembranes and geocomposite clay liners used as waterproof barriers
Barrier types and performance requirements
There are many different types of barriers manufactured from various materials that prevent the
movement of water. The European application standards BS EN 161201 and BS EN 162201
define three different types of barrier
polymeric geosynthetic barriers plastic sheets such as polyethylene, PVC and polypropylene that
are usually referred to as geomembranes
bituminous geosynthetic barriers
geocomposite clay geosynthetic barriers a sandwich of bentonite clay between two geotextiles
commonly known as geocomposite clay liners (GCLs).
All the different materials have their own design considerations, and some will be more suitable than others
for a given application. The prevention of water leakage from SuDS components is the primary purpose for
any geomembrane or GCL. Most membranes, even very thin ones, will have sufficiently low permeability
to contain water in a SuDS component if the material is intact and has been completely sealed during
installation. However, with thinner and less durable membranes, leakage is likely to occur (Box 30.1), so
reducing the risk of leakage tends to be the primary concern, rather than material permeability.
Leakage can occur due to poor field or factory seaming, or damage caused during or after installation.
The main concerns in choosing a geomembrane barrier are
design and detailing to avoid tensile stresses in the membrane as far as possible
construction quality control to minimise the risk of damage
specification of membranes that have good resistance to puncturing and tearing (or the associated
specification of geotextiles to protect thinner membranes) to minimise the risk of damage during and
after construction.
Geosynthetic barriers and especially geomembranes should be installed by experienced and suitably
qualified staff. The British Geomembrane Association (BGA) has an installer accreditation scheme
approved by the Environment Agency and The Welding Institute (TWI) http://tinyurl.com/qzmdpna.

BOX
30.1
TABLE
30.8
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
It is important that all joints and seams are visually inspected and tested on site to ensure that they meet
the required standard. The main places where leaks are likely to occur is around penetrations, such as
where a pipe passes through the material (eg where a pipe passes into a lined tank).
GCLs are generally used in combination with an existing clay barrier or in combination with a geomembrane
in applications in which a significant water head is maintained. GCLs are not recommended for use on their
own around geocellular tanks. However, where they are used under shallow SuDS water components, they
may be suitable on their own (eg to prevent significant infiltration from a swale with a low head of water).
Geomembranes and construction
A critical property of any waterproof barrier is its ability to survive the construction process intact
and in a good condition, so as to reduce the subsequent permeation of water to acceptable levels.
The key physical parameters of barriers to be considered are
the material it is manufactured from
its physical properties (tensile strength, puncture resistance, tear resistance)
its permeability.
Thickness also becomes a key parameter, if joints of polymeric barriers are welded see Mallett
et al (201). Protection of barriers during construction may be required to ensure that they have
retained their integrity.
Particular care is required in specifying membranes below permeable pavements where the coarse-
graded aggregate is located directly on the membrane. Thin membranes less than 0.5 mm thick are
not likely to survive in this situation without holes occurring.
Design considerations
Key issues to be considered for any barrier system are set out in Table 30.8, together with the
appropriate design approaches.
Design considerations for waterproof barriers in SuDS
Design consideration Design approach for the application of waterproof barriers in SuDS
Slope stability
For most SuDS applications, slopes should be low, which will minimise the risk
of instability, but where geomembranes and geotextiles are to be laid on slopes,
a stability assessment should be undertaken by a suitably qualified geotechnical
engineer or engineering geologist.
Tree root penetration
If the system is well constructed and does not leak and nearby trees have sufficient
and suitable soil around the roots, then root penetration through geomembranes
should not be a problem. Risk of tree root penetration can be minimised by locating
tanks outside the rooting area of trees or, where this cannot be achieved, by
providing root barriers to protect membranes.
Temperature effects (thermal
stresses in polymeric
membranes and freee/thaw
in GCLs) and UV light
Geomembranes used in SuDS should normally not be exposed at ground level
and will be covered by soil or aggregate. Temperature effects can be minimised by
ensuring an adequate thickness of covering soil. The thickness required will depend
on the local climate. However, experience with green roofs has shown that even a
thin covering of soil (150 mm or greater) can improve the lifespan of waterproofing
barriers significantly by protecting them from extreme changes in temperature and
the associated stresses, as well as from UV light (Edge et al, 2007).
Drying and wetting effects
for GCLs
Geocomposite clay liners include a layer of bentonite that has to be hydrated to form
the barrier to water. If the GCL dries out, the bentonite shrinks and cracks. However,
the bentonite will swell again on rehydration when it comes into contact with water,
so there should not be any significant effect. Most GCL manufacturers should have
test data to show that the GCLs can selfheal, if they dry out and are rehydrated.

TABLE
30.8
Design considerations for waterproof barriers in SuDS
Design consideration Design approach for the application of waterproof barriers in SuDS
All barriers need to be joined together to be fully watertight. For polymeric
membranes, this should be achieved by welding the sheets together. Taped joints
are not suitable for water-retaining applications, and the conditions of installation for
SuDS mean that it is unlikely that a taped joint can be formed effectively. The main
reason for this is that an even pressure has to be applied over the whole joint area,
and an even and firm substrate is required below the membrane to achieve this.
This is not likely to be present in most SuDS installations.
Effective forming of taped seams requires firm, even support to allow pressure to be
applied with a roller.
The thickness of a membrane is very important when considering welding.
Membranes less than 1 mm thick are much more prone to welding problems,
especially of burning holes in the material (Schiers, 2009). However, thinner
membranes of the same material tend to be more flexible and are easier to install,
especially around geocellular tanks, where corners and other details are much
more prevalent. Flexible membranes can also be prefabricated into panels in the
factory. There is, therefore, a trade-off between robustness and the risk of defects
due to difficulty of installation. If a membrane less than 1 mm thick is to be welded, it
should be shown, by testing a trial welded joint, that it can be joined in a satisfactory
manner (known as a seam test).
Watertight seams
Figure 0.2 Applying pressure to a taped joint to ensure
adequate sealing (courtesy EPG Limited)
Where GCLs are used, they cannot (and do not need to) be welded together. They
rely on good overlap and pressure on them to maintain an effective seal. The
minimum overlap should be 00 mm, with sufficient soil cover to hold the GCL
sheets in place. The geotextile panels can also be welded to minimise the risk of
movement between adjacent panels.
Chemical
Geomembranes and GCLs are resistant to a wide range of chemicals, but there
are some that are known to have a deleterious effect. Chemicals that affect GCLs
do not usually affect membranes and vice versa, hence they are often used in
combination. A thorough assessment of the potential exposure of geomembranes
to chemicals and the likely effects, should be made, especially where they are used
in contaminated sites or in sites where the runoff could be highly polluted, such as
industrial sites.
666 Part E: Supporting guidance
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Desin erifiation ans
Where geosynthetic barriers are to be included as part of a SuDS, a verification plan should be provided
as part of the design. The plan should outline the required performance verification activities (inspection
and testing), the relevant personnel to be used and the types of records to be collected. The greater the
reliance that is placed on the barrier, the greater the verification requirements. The plan would need to be
flexible enough to respond to any changes to the design of the SuDS (either during the design process or
during construction), but it should be sufficiently well defined to enable all parties to appreciate the scope
of these activities and how they could affect, or be affected by, the construction. The plan should identify
its objectives (ie why it is being carried out), the method(s) to be employed, the critical parts of the barrier
and the potential (or perceived) areas of weakness that would need particular attention during verification.
The verification should be carried out by a third party that is independent of the installer of the barrier
(Box 30.2). The Environment Agency has provided clear advice with respect to the level of independence
and verification in relation to work on landfill sites (EA, 2010).
BOX
30.2
ndeendent erifiation
The Environment Agency recommends that conflicts of interest in verification should be avoided
in the field of contaminated land verification (EA, 2010). The same philosophy should apply to
verification of geomembranes in SuDS.
A contractor or membrane supplier certifying their own work or product is considered to be a conflict
of interest and is not good practice. If verification is carried out by the same company (or related
company) that carried out the installation, then the process, the results and the report should be
audited by an independent consultant (Mallett et al, 201).
erifiation test methods for eomembranes after onstrution
After installation of a geomembrane in SuDS, it may require testing to show that the joints are fully sealed and
that the main body of material has not been damaged and does not have any holes or tears. Test methods that
have been, or could be, used on geosynthetic barriers in SuDS can be subdivided into two main elements
1 testing of seams
pressurised air channel tests to ASTM D520-95 and D7177-05
mechanical point stress test to ASTM D7-0
air lance test to ASTM D7-0.
2 testing of (large) areas of flat gas membrane installed in its final position
tracer gas testing
dielectric porosity testing to ASTM D77-1 and ASTM D720-06
smoke testing.
Further information on these tests is provided in
Mallett et al (201).
30.5.5 Use of geotextiles to protect
geomembranes from damage
The purpose of protection geotextiles is to prevent
damage to geosynthetic barriers (primarily
polymeric barriers). They may be placed above and/
or below a membrane, depending on the design
of the barrier system and the underlying/overlying
materials. In some applications, geosynthetic
barriers can be exposed to significant puncture and

CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
shear forces (eg below permeable pavements and wrapping geocellular tanks, where a minimum 2 mm
thick and minimum 00 g/m2 weight geotextile should be specified).
As discussed above the geotextile should be sufficiently strong and durable to withstand the forces
applied to it, which requires an assessment of the puncture and tearing forces on the geotextile.
Protection is normally achieved by using thicker non-woven geotextiles, although GCLs have also been
used as protection layers.
30.5.6 Geocomposites used for drainage layers or in trenches
Geocomposites are a form of geosynthetic that is made by creating a single component from two or
more elements (eg a drainage core and a geotextile). An example of a geocomposite used for drainage is
shown in Figure 30.4.
Figure 0. Geocomposite drainage layer (courtesy Stormwater Management Ltd and Geosynthetics Ltd)
The main requirements for the geotextile will be the same as for any other filtration application as
described in Section 30.5.3. The drainage core will need sufficient in-plane permeability to convey the
required water flows, and this can be tested in accordance with BS EN ISO 12952010 at an applied
normal stress that reflects what will occur in service. It is particularly important that the correct boundary
conditions are assessed for in-plane flow. BS EN ISO 1295 expects soft plattens to simulate soil/stone
backfill, but has the option of hard plattens to simulate geomembrane. Soft platten results are often much
lower than hard platten results.
The geotextile will also need to be sufficiently permeable to allow water to enter the core, and this should
be determined in accordance with BS EN ISO 11052010. A specification for geocomposites to be used
in drainage is provided in the HA (2009a).
Geocomposites have been used to collect water from the sub-base of permeable pavements (laid
vertically and connected to pipes). They have also been laid horiontally below the sub-base to
enhance the drainage. In this situation they are subject to traffic loads and the strength and deflection
Figure 0.5 Geocomposite drainage strips used below permeable paving

CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
characteristics will have to be assessed to ensure that the geocomposite can support the loads and the
pavement materials can tolerate the deflections that occur in the composite under traffic loadings.
30.5.7 Geosynthetics and natural materials used for erosion control
Erosion control is an important consideration in SuDS design and construction. It is especially important
immediately after construction when vegetation is not fully established. Materials used as erosion
control blankets in SuDS include jute netting, coir blankets and synthetic products. They allow the quick
establishment of vegetation on slopes and channels subject to erosion from water action and can also
slow down the velocity of water flowing across a surface (Chapter 29).
All erosion control blankets work by providing some mechanical anchorage to top soil/sediments and
seeds. The choice of a suitable specification will depend on whether the erosion protection is required to
be temporary or permanent.
Erosion control blankets usually comprise biodegradable mesh-like products, which will disappear in one
to five seasons, depending on the material, and hence are suitable for the establishment of low-growing
vegetation. Jute and similar products will degrade in one or two growing season and are usually designed
to help establish grass/turf in locations where there is not likely to be high water flows. The longer-lasting
products, such as those made of coir (woven coconut fibre mesh), can be used for lining of swales and
ponds where slightly longer-term abrasion/erosion protection is required to ensure that vegetation can
become fully established. If the erosion control blankets are required to operate over the full service life
of the SuDS, then the materials used should not be biodegradable, and a synthetic mat should be used.
Non-biodegradable products are synthetic materials and usually comprise D random fibre mats or
honeycomb webs. Some synthetic products are also photodegradable, and the same principles apply the
product should last for the full service life of the SuDS.
Erosion control blankets can be supplied on their own or can be preplanted.
The important parameters to consider when specifying erosion control matting are
weight gives some indication of durability
yarn thickness and number of threads gives some indication of durability and strength
open area affects water permeability and soil retention properties
yarn quality affects how long the mesh takes to degrade, its water retention and its flexibility
function when installed will it be planted up for eventual self-sustainability and cohesion with new
developing root systems (in which case a biodegradable material is suitable) or will it need to act as
erosion control in the longer term, such as for topsoil retention on slopes (in which case the product
should not degrade over the service life of the SuDS)
There are no UK or European standards relating to the use of erosion control matting. BS EN 125201
does not cover surface erosion, where the geotextile or geotextile-related product is located at the
surface. Examples of erosion control products are shown in Figures 30.6 to 30.8.

Construction
This chapter provides general good practice guidance on the
construction of SuDS schemes.
Construction checklists are provided in Appendix B.
uidance on construction for specific types of SuS component can be found in
Chapters 11–23.
31.1 CONSTRUCTION BEST PRACTICE FOR SUDS
The construction of SuDS usually only requires the use of standard civil engineering
and landscaping operations such as excavation, filling, grading, pipe-laying, chamber
construction, topsoiling, seeding and planting. These operations are specified in various
standard construction documents, such as WRc (2011). However, there are some
specific process and programming considerations required for their application to SuDS
construction, as described in Box 31.1.
The same attention to detail (including tolerances) for SuDS construction is required as
for other forms of construction. Contractors will become familiar with the specific issues
and construction techniques as the use of SuDS becomes more widespread.
BOX
31.1
General construction issues relating to SuDS
1 Programming
The programming of SuDS construction needs to be considered at all
stages of the site construction process. Subsurface piped drainage
networks are usually one of the first facilities to be constructed on a site.
For SuDS, although the form of the drainage will be constructed during
the earthworks phase, the final construction should not take place until
the end of the development programme, unless adequate provision is
made to remove any silt that is deposited during construction operations
and to refurbish any areas that have been subject to over-compaction.
Method statements and pre-construction site planning operations will
form an essential part of pre-construction activities to ensure successful
completion of the SuDS.
The construction of swales, basins and ponds at an early stage in the
construction can assist in managing runoff and help settle out the high
volumes of sediments created during construction. However, complete
reinstatement of these components will be required once construction
is finished. The contract is likely to stipulate establishment of vegetation
and sediment removal sometime after site works have been completed
and before the start of the maintenance period.
2 Pollution and sediment control
Runoff from a construction site should not be allowed to enter SuDS
or flow off site unless it has been allowed for in the design and
specification. Construction runoff is heavily laden with sediment, which
can clog infiltration systems, build up in storage systems and pollute
receiving waters. Certain SuDS components should not be used to

BOX
31.1
General construction issues relating to SuDS
manage construction runoff, for example pervious surfaces. No traffic should be allowed to run on
pervious surface components if it is likely to introduce sediment onto the pavement surface from
dusty or muddy areas, or result in over-compaction. One way of protecting permeable sub-base
construction, so that it can be used for construction traffic, is to cover it with a layer of asphalt
concrete that is cored through before laying the blocks to make it permeable (Chapter 20).
3 Access and storage areas
Traditional car parking and other paved areas are usually constructed (or partially constructed)
during the initial stages of the development, and then used as access roads and storage areas.
If pervious surfaces are proposed, pavement construction should be carried out at the end of the
development programme, unless adequate protection is provided to preventing clogging or blinding.
Ease of access for the construction of other components needs to be considered at the design and
programming stage.
4 Skills
The contractor and all relevant operatives should have a general understanding of how SuDS
work and the purpose of the specific SuDS components being used on a site, to ensure that
appropriate construction practice and component protection is used. “Toolbox talks” for workers are
a particularly effective way of increasing awareness of appropriate construction of SuDS.
Infiltration system rotetion
If SuDS components do not allow infiltration, the use of hardcore for structural purposes below the
level of any liner or other impermeable layer may be acceptable. However, the use of hardcore is
not advised if infiltration is intended, due to the high proportion of fines generally present in such fill
material. Total exclusion ones may be required for construction traffic over infiltration surfaces to
prevent compaction and other damage to the ground that will affect the infiltration performance. This
may include complete isolation from runoff during construction if the component is located at a low
point on the site. Proof rolling of pavement formations is not recommended as this will compact the
ground and reduce the infiltration rate, so other methods of identifying soft spots should be used.
6 Landscaping
Good landscape construction practices are fundamental to SuDS construction. As SuDS are
normally surface systems, attention to detail and aesthetics should be given a high priority. The
seasonal and physical requirements of planting and the requirements for establishing vegetation and
preventing soil erosion should be given careful consideration. Appropriately skilled and experienced
operatives are required with an understanding of all aspects of vegetation establishment. Adjacent
ground levels to components should be designed to prevent any overland sediment wash-off during
high intensity rainfall events, or groundwater seepage during particularly wet periods. Settlement of
soils should also be taken into consideration. Further guidance is provided in Chapter 29.
7 Erosion control
Before runoff is allowed to flow through vegetated SuDS, they should be fully stabilised by planting
or temporary erosion protection. This will prevent erosion of the sides and base or the clogging of
downstream components.
8 Construction and handover inspection
Provision should be made in the construction contract for inspections at key stages, and on completion of
construction, to ensure that the system has been constructed in accordance with the approved design and
specification. As-constructed drawings should be produced and an as-constructed survey undertaken to
ensure that design levels have been achieved. A construction checklist is provided in Appendix B.
Seifiations an ills of uantities
Designers should highlight particular matters associated with the above points that are likely to impact
the operation and performance of specific SuDS components. The type of specification and/or bills of
quantities will depend upon the form of construction contract being used for the specific project.

31.2 CONSTRUCTION PROGRAMMING FOR SUDS
Effective construction programming for SuDS is very important in order to:
protect the receiving environment from runoff during construction
protect each SuDS component from damage during construction
protect the natural infiltration characteristics of the site soils and subsoils
deliver a surface water management system where runoff is conveyed and stored, as designed,
without causing unacceptable erosion, channelling or sedimentation
promote the healthy establishment of required vegetation and habitats
facilitate and accommodate appropriate inspections required by adoption bodies during the
construction period.
Construction activities do not usually occur in a specified linear sequence, and programmes will vary,
owing to weather and other unpredictable factors. Construction should be co-ordinated with other
development activities, so that all work can take place in an orderly manner and on programme.
Experience shows that careful project programming improves efficiency, reduces cost and lowers the
potential for erosion and sedimentation problems.
Construction access is normally the first land-disturbing activity. Care should be exercised so as not to
damage infiltration surfaces or valuable trees or to disturb designated buffer ones or natural hydrological
features that are to be protected for the site. Access should be designed to use existing gaps in hedges
where possible. Trees should be protected following the guidance in BS 5837:2012. Activities that could
compact the root zone should not be allowed in the designated tree root protection zone and barriers
should be installed to prevent access to these areas.
Seiment asins an tras should be installed before any major site earthworks/groundworks take
place. Further sediment traps and silt fences should be installed as earthworks/groundworks progress, to
keep sediment contained on site at appropriate locations.
unoff ontrol measures should be used in conjunction with sediment traps to divert water around
planned earthworks areas and to remove silt. Surface water runoff from upstream should be diverted
around areas to be disturbed before any earthworks/groundworks operations. Any perimeter drains
should be installed with stable outfalls before opening major areas up for development. Any additional
facilities needed for runoff control should be installed as earthworks/groundworks take place.
e main runoff oneyane system with inlet and outlet protection measures is often installed
early, and used to convey surface water runoff through the development site without creating gullies or
channels. Inlet protection for surface water drains should be installed as soon as the drain is functional, to
trap sediment on site in shallow pools and to allow flood flows to safely enter the surface water drainage
system. Outlet protection should be installed at the same time as the conveyance system to prevent
damage to the receiving water body.
Clearing and earthworks/groundworks should only be started when adequate erosion and sediment
control measures are in place. Once a development area is cleared, earthworks should follow
immediately, so that protective ground cover can be re-established quickly. Areas should not be left bare
and exposed for extended periods. Adjoining areas planned for development or those that are to be
used for borrow and disposal should be left undisturbed as long as possible, to serve as natural buffer
ones. Runoff control is essential during the earthworks/groundworks periods. Temporary diversions,
slope drains and inlet and outlet protection installed in a timely manner can be very effective in controlling
erosion during this critical period of development.
Surfae stailisation measures should be applied to completed areas, channels, ditches and other
disturbed areas after the land is cleared and profiled. Any disturbed area where active construction will
not take place for more than 60 working days should be stabilised by temporary seeding and/or mulching
Chapter 31: Construction
677
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
or by other suitable means. Permanent stabilisation measures should be installed as soon as possible
after final profiling. Temporary seeding and/or mulching may be necessary during extreme weather
conditions, with permanent vegetation measures delayed until a more suitable installation time.
onstrution of erious surfaes lansae ors an final stailisation should be left to the
later stages of construction. All disturbed areas should have permanent stabilisation measures applied.
Unstable sediment should be removed from sediment basins and traps and, if possible, incorporated
into the topsoil, not just spread on the surface. All temporary structures should be removed after the
area above has been properly stabilised. Borrow and disposal areas should be permanently vegetated
or otherwise stabilised. Infiltration and filtration surfaces that have been protected during construction
should be rehabilitated (if required), exposed and stabilised.
Upon completion of construction (including vegetation establishment where this is part of the SuDS or
associated with runoff surfaces contributing inflows to the SuDS), there is likely to be a commissioning
period in which the permanent SuDS are made live, ie flow is diverted into them. If permanent SuDS
components have been used wholly or in part to drain the site or as other forms of temporary works, such
as roads or storage areas, there may be rehabilitation works required to reconstitute or restore them
to their design condition. Construction programming should aim to minimise the need for rehabilitation
works. Once the permanent components have been demonstrated to work as envisaged, then temporary
drainage and sediment and erosion control measures can be carefully dismantled, so as not to generate
sediment loadings to downstream systems.
In programming construction work, all land-disturbing activities necessary to complete the proposed
project should be outlined and then all practices needed to control erosion and sedimentation on the
site should be listed in sequence. Features requiring particular attention during planning a construction
project are: site access; storage of materials; interim site drainage during the construction phase; and
protection of surfaces (such as to prevent compaction – Figures 31.1 and 31.2).

pervious surface construction intended to infiltrate water
to ground. Compaction will reduce the infiltration rate
(courtesy EPG Limited)
Figure 31.2 Absence of erosion protection before
establishment of vegetation (courtesy EPG Limited)
Small sites with no unused space can be difficult to programme if extensive permeable/infiltrating
surfaces are part of the design. Figure 31.3 shows the construction of concrete block permeable paving
on a small infill development of a few houses. The construction of the paving has been left until the end of
the project when there will be no or limited work that can result in damage or clogging of the pavement. It
will be difficult to avoid compaction of the soils at formation on such a site. If the pavement was intended
to allow infiltration to the soil below, it may be necessary to rotovate or scarify the formation to rehabilitate
the infiltration capacity before constructing the surface (or design the pavement with an outfall to a sewer
or watercourse). Another method of protecting the formation is to leave a sacrificial 200 mm or so layer of
soil in place until final excavation to formation levels just before the pavement is constructed.

31.3 CONSTRUCTION METHOD STATEMENTS
The purpose of a construction method statement is to:
formalise who is responsible for completing the work
set out the approach, processes and programme proposed for constructing and stabilising the SuDS
(so that those with delivery responsibility understand what is to be done, how and why)
identify any unusual items or methods of working that are required.
Every job is different and every method statement should be site specific. Most of the information
included in standard method statements for health and safety and general management of the
construction process will be acceptable, with the addition of information specific to the SuDS. This means
that there will be negligible extra work required to prepare the SuDS construction method statement. The
main requirements for a SuDS construction method statement are:
details of the nature of the work to be completed
site plans and full scheme drawings, where these are required to support the method of approach
consents and reinstatement requirements
access points and details
any site-specific ecological issues or features that require protection and/or consideration
any likely water quality issues resulting from the SuDS construction
the proposed strategy for sediment control and site drainage during the construction of the
development, where this impacts on the SuDS proposed for the site; it should identify any potential
impacts on the final performance of the drainage system and any necessary protection measures (or
remedial works such as silt removal at the end of construction of the development)
Chapter 31: Construction
679
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
measures to prevent inadvertent access across the completed or partially completed SuDS; for
example the area above a geocellular tank that has not been designed to support heavy traffic, or
a completed infiltration basin that cannot be trafficked, should be surrounded by a physical barrier
vehicle access routes should be clearly marked (this is usually required for safety reasons as well).
Contractors and developers are familiar with preparing construction method statements for a wide variety
of purposes, not least to manage health and safety and contractual risks on construction sites.
In terms of health and safety, the method statement details a safe system of work. It identifies the haards
that may arise during construction and the measures that are to be taken to ensure that the hazards do
not pose an unacceptable risk to workers and the public.
Method statements for SuDS are necessary because many people in the construction industry are not
familiar with the specific requirements for constructing SuDS and some of the requirements are contrary
to accepted practice in some fields (for example, the requirement for a drop from hard surfaces to
grassed areas where water is flowing off an edge is the opposite to normal practice, which is to raise the
turf level above the hard surface).
It is also important to understand the impact of other construction activities on the SuDS (for example,
once permeable sub-base is laid, it cannot be used as a construction route or platform, unless it is
protected from siltation and loading damage. The permeable sub-base in the parking bays in Figure 31.4
has been protected by a temporary cover of hardcore over a geotextile separator. The road surface has
been left lower than the edging (before final surfacing which is normal practice) and this also prevents silt-
laden runoff draining onto the parking areas.
Figure 1. Temporary surface over permeable sub-base in parking bays (geotextile and hardcore) (courtesy EPG Limited)
The construction method statement should be used by the drainage adoption body to plan the appropriate
construction inspection regime that will enable them to be satisfied that the system has been constructed
in accordance with the design. Guidance on delivery of an appropriate construction assessment process
is set out in Appendix B.
The implementation of a comprehensive quality assurance (QA) regime is fundamental to the achievement
of a minimum standard of workmanship. It is generally accepted that a high proportion of the perceived
failures of SuDS are as a direct result of either poor quality workmanship at the installation stage or damage
during construction. Construction method statements are a crucial part of reducing construction risks.
680 Part E: Supporting guidance
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Correct construction of SuDS is of equal importance to design if the systems are to be successfully
implemented, and the key to this is conveying information to site staff (management and operatives).
They should be made aware of how the SuDS scheme operates, the design requirements and how
their actions on site can affect the final performance of the scheme. It is important to talk to people on
site, especially operatives, and to ensure that all subcontractors and their staff are also involved in this
process. Site staff and operatives should also be taught how to install critical items, if necessary, for
example where geotextiles and geomembranes are to be placed in the construction. Clogging, blinding
or over-compaction of permeable surfaces due to unconsidered construction activities are common
risks. The preparation and dissemination of appropriately detailed method statements emphasising the
differences from traditional construction activities is seen as an important communication channel, to be
used in conjunction with toolbox talks and direct briefings to operatives. To assist in these processes a
construction site handbook is available (Woods Ballard et al, 2007)
31.4 EROSION CONTROL
ators inuenin erosion durin onstrution
Any activity that disturbs the natural soil and vegetation has the potential to increase erosion, because
bare loose soil is easily moved by wind or water.
Factors affecting the erosion potential of any site include soil type, geology, vegetative cover, topography,
climate and land use. Physical properties of soils, such as particle size, cohesiveness, and density, affect
its erodibility. Loose silt and sand-sied particles are more susceptible to erosion than clay soils. Coarser
soils are less susceptible to wind erosion, but are often found on steeper slopes that are subject to water
erosion. When surface cover and soil structure are disturbed, the soil’s erodibility potential increases.
Construction activities disrupt the soil structure and its vegetative cover.
Vegetation plays an important role in controlling erosion. Roots bind soil particles together, and the
leaves or blades of grass reduce raindrop impact forces on the soil. Grass litter and other ground cover
traps rain, which allows infiltration and reduces runoff velocity. Also carefully sited vegetation can steer
pedestrian movement away from vulnerable areas to prevent erosion.
Vegetation reduces wind velocities at the ground surface and provides a rougher surface that will trap
particles moving along the ground. Once vegetation is removed, erosion can proceed unchecked.
The factors that influence land erosion by water are
runoff velocity
runoff volume
soil type
vegetation cover
machinery and plant
de-watering outlets.
Land erosion is caused by the runoff being of sufficient velocity to strip fine silts and soils. ale shows
how different type of soils and vegetation coverage can affect the velocity needed to cause erosion.

The objective of erosion control is to limit the amount and rate of erosion occurring on disturbed areas.
Erosion of the surface of SuDS components will reduce their effectiveness and add to the silt load to
downstream components and/or receiving water bodies. Design requirements to help prevent erosion,
such as limiting water velocities, are discussed in the individual technical SuDS component chapters.
Erosion controls are surface treatments that stabilise soil exposed by excavation or earthworks/groundworks.
Erosion control activities that should be considered during construction include the following:
1 Conduct all land disturbing activities in a manner that effectively reduces accelerated soil erosion
and reduces sediment movement and deposition off-site.
2 Schedule construction activities to minimise the total amount of soil exposed at any given time, to
reduce the period of accelerated soil erosion.
3 Establish temporary or permanent cover on areas that have been disturbed as soon as possible
after final grading is completed.
4 Design and construct all temporary or permanent facilities for the conveyance of water around,
through or from the disturbed area to limit the flow of water to non-erosive velocities.
5 Remove sediment caused by accelerated soil erosion from surface runoff water before it leaves the site.
6 Stabilise the areas of land disturbance with permanent vegetative cover as quickly as possible.
Permanent or temporary soil surface stabilisation should be considered for application to disturbed areas
and soil stockpiles as soon as possible after final profile is reached on any portion of the site. Soil surface
stabilisation should also be considered for disturbed areas that may not be at final profile but will remain
undisturbed for more than 60 days.
A viable vegetative cover should be established within one year on all disturbed areas and soil stockpiles
not otherwise permanently stabilised. Vegetation is not considered established until a ground cover is
achieved that is sufficiently mature to control soil erosion and can survive moderate runoff events.
Roads and other hardstandings should be covered as early as possible with the appropriate bound layer
where this is specified as part of the pavement.
If stockpiles are located within 30 m of a watercourse, sediment controls, such as a diversion ditch or silt
fence, should be provided.
Properties and roadways adjacent to a construction site should be protected from eroded sediment
being transported onto them. Whenever construction vehicles enter onto paved roads, provisions should
be made to prevent the transport of sediment (mud and dirt) by those vehicles. Whenever sediment is
transported onto a public road, regardless of the size of the site, the roads should be cleaned at least
daily or as required to keep the roads clear of mud.
Temporary diversion ditches should be considered above disturbed areas and may be discharged to a
permanent or temporary channel. Diversion ditches located mid-slope on a disturbed area or at the base
of a disturbed area should discharge to a sediment trap or basin.

31.4.3 Erosion protection techniques
Impermeable area runoff should not be allowed to flow directly over areas of exposed ground. Runoff
should either be intercepted by a sewer system or gravel trench, or suitable erosion protection techniques
should be used. Approaches include:
vegetation – reinforces the soil due to the binding effects of the root structure. It helps protect areas
downstream by the friction effect of the vegetation decreasing the runoff velocity.
eotetiles eoellular onfinement an erosion ontrol faris – reinforce the soil structure
reducing the potential for particle stripping (Chapter 30).
reinfore rass – consists of plastic moulds which are placed in the soil and allow grass to
grow though them. Reinforced grass has the benefit of offering early erosion protection as well as
protecting the grass areas from traffic loading.
gravel trenches – can be located upstream of exposed land. They intercept runoff that then enters
a perforated pipe system to an outfall or infiltrates into the ground. However, because they are
usually sacrificial in nature, these systems can be relatively expensive to install for short durations. If
such a system is being installed as part of the final SuDS solution for a site, it should not be used for
construction runoff, because heavy sediment loads during construction will reduce its design life.
at sites or sla raients – will help reduce the velocity of the runoff.
Further guidance is provided in Hewlett et al (1996) and Coppin and Richards (2007).
31.5 SEDIMENT CONTROL
rinies of sediment ontro
During a rainfall event, runoff normally builds up rapidly to a peak and then diminishes. Because the
amount of sediment conveyed in runoff is dependent upon the velocity and volume of that runoff,
sediment tends to be deposited as runoff rates decrease. The deposited sediments may be resuspended
with subsequent runoff – in this way, sediments are moved progressively downstream.
By effectively controlling erosion (Section 31.4), the supply of sediment on a site can be significantly
reduced, but sediment trapping and management will still be required for residual loadings.
Sediment ontro tehniues
Sediment controls used during construction include straw bale barriers, geotextile silt fences and
sediment basins. The type of sediment control system to be used depends on the catchment area and the
site slope. Proprietary treatment systems have also been used to control construction stage sediment in
surface water drainage systems. ale summarises the recommended maximum catchment areas,
slope lengths and slopes for straw bale barriers and geotextile silt fences.

All runoff leaving a disturbed area should pass through a sediment control system before it exits the site
and is conveyed downstream.
Chapter 31: Construction
683
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Straw bale barriers or silt fences may be used for small sites. When the catchment area is greater than
that specified in the table, runoff should be collected in diversion ditches and routed through temporary
sediment basins.
Straw bales can be placed at the base of a slope to act as a sediment barrier. Straw bales are temporary
in nature and may only perform for a period of weeks or months. Proper installation and maintenance is
necessary to ensure their performance.
A silt fence is made of a woven synthetic material, geotextile, and acts to filter runoff. Silt fencing can be
placed as a temporary barrier along the contour at the base of a disturbed area. The material is durable
and will last for more than one season if properly installed and maintained. Silt fencing is not intended to
be used as a perimeter fence or in areas of concentrated flow paths. If concentrated flow conditions exist,
a more robust filter should be considered.
Silt barriers can also be temporarily installed in or around any road gullies of partially constructed roads
to prevent sediment movement into downstream drainage systems.
Where some sediment loads are still likely to be transported into the construction drainage system,
sediment basins, proprietary systems or other facilities should be designed to trap it and facilitate its
easy removal. Consideration should be given to the risk of sediment resuspension during storm events,
and appropriate risk management measures should be put in place. Suitable sediment removal regimes
should be identified to ensure that the storage capacity of the component is not exceeded. Where
there is a risk of sediment contamination, it may be necessary to line the basin to prevent any risks of
contamination of underlying soils and/or groundwater. Where basins, proprietary treatment systems or
other methods are to be included as permanent features in the SuDS design, they will require complete
clean-out (and rehabilitation if necessary) once construction is complete.
31.6 POLLUTION CONTROL
31.6.1 Pollution prevention
Detailed guidance on prevention of pollution during construction is provided in Masters-Williams et al
(2001) and also in the pollution prevention guidelines produced by the EA et al (2012).
The main requirements are to control pollution loads from surface water runoff and pumped water from
construction sites to ensure that risks to the environment are minimised. The safe storage of materials
and fuels is also important so that if spills occur they are contained (by the use of berms, check ditches or
other containment techniques) and do not cause mix with runoff and thus increase pollution risks.
Before mobilisation, the construction site layout should be planned so as to fully consider issues such
as the location of stockpiles, fuel stores, storage areas, waste disposal, refuelling points and wash down
areas. These should be located in areas where they are least likely to affect receiving water bodies
(including groundwater). Planning should also address subjects such as the diversion of watercourses,
prevention of upstream runoff entering the site and the design of haul roads, including the use of road
bridges over watercourses to stop vehicles fording streams and rivers.
An environmental pollution protection plan should also be put in place. The plan should include:
location of foul drainage disposal routes
location of surface water systems that discharge into watercourses
requirements for discharge and abstraction licences
location of spillage kits
an action plan in the event of an environmental incident (including a list of relevant telephone
contact numbers).

CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
onstrution oution soures and ontros
Sediment
Sediment is one of the major sources of construction site pollution. The following list indicates a number
of sources and the measures that can be taken to help prevent pollution:
Excavated ground and exposed ground – The effect of having no vegetation and being recently
disturbed allows for relatively low velocity runoff to erode the surface. To help prevent the pollution
from entering a watercourse, silt fences, hay bales or stilling ponds should be placed downstream.
To limit the volume of runoff reaching the exposed ground, runoff diversion or interception devices
should be placed upstream.
Stockpiles – The effects of erosion on a stockpile will depend on the type of material being stored.
Fine sand and topsoil stockpiles will be eroded far more readily than heavy granular materials.
Stockpiles should be located away from a watercourse or site drainage system. Protective coverings
will help prevent runoff stripping the stockpile.
Plant and wheel washing – Plant and wheel washing should take place in designated locations.
The area should be tanked and should not be allowed to discharge into a watercourse or infiltrate
groundwater, as the wastewater from these devices is highly contaminated with silts, sands and
hydrocarbons. Some proprietary vehicle washing systems offer a recycling facility, which filters and
settles solids, with the effluent being pumped back into the system. The solid waste materials from
this process need to be treated as contaminated waste due to the high hydrocarbon content.
Haul roads – The runoff from haul roads contains a large amount of suspended solids as well as
hydrocarbons. Haul roads should be designed so that the length is kept to a minimum, while still
serving its purpose. The gradient should be shallow to prevent increasing runoff velocity and, if
possible, bunds and/or discrete ditches should be constructed to intercept the runoff. Haul roads
should be sprayed regularly to keep down dust. If any section of a haul road is hard surfaced, then it
should be swept on a regular basis to prevent the accumulation of dust and mud.
Disturane of rieres or ans – Excavation of riverbanks or beds can generate silty water, as
the excavated and exposed material is washed downstream. The amount of such excavation needs to
be limited and, if undertaken, the water area downstream needs to be protected by booms. For larger
projects, consideration should be given to diverting the river while such excavations take place.
De-watering operations – Groundwater discharge due to excavation activity is likely to be heavily
polluted with suspended solids and should not be discharged directly into a watercourse. To help
reduce the amount of suspended solids within the runoff a number of techniques can be adopted:
passing the discharge water over a grass area, but the discharge velocity has to be monitored
and kept sufficiently low to promote settlement
passing the discharge water though a temporary gravel strip
controlled use of skips and/or tanks to act as stilling basins
controlled use of stilling ponds.
is and hdroarbons
The use of oils and hydrocarbons on construction sites creates an inherent risk of leakages and
spillages, which could potentially lead to pollution incidents. ale details the potential sources of
hydrocarbon pollution.
Simple measures can be taken to prevent oil and hydrocarbons becoming entrained in surface runoff, such as:
appropriate maintenance of machinery and plant
drip trays
regular checking of machinery and plant for oil leaks
correct storage facilities

31.7 SUDS CONSTRUCTION INSPECTIONS
Inspections are required at frequent intervals during SuDS construction and also once construction is
complete and the system is operating as designed. Inspections are required to ensure that each element
of the system is constructed correctly, and that design assumptions and criteria are not invalidated,
for example, by the construction methods used, by changes made on site or by variations in ground
conditions. The form of the inspection will depend upon the type of construction contract used, but an
independent inspection regime by the approval body or designer is preferred to any contractor self-
certification approach. A construction checklist is provided in Appendix B.
These inspections should be undertaken as necessary, but as a minimum would generally be expected
to include:
1 pre-excavation inspection to ensure that construction runoff is being adequately dealt with on site
and will not cause clogging of the SuDS
2 inspections of excavations for ponds, infiltration devices, swales etc
inspections of infiltration surfaces before overlay by any construction
4 inspections during laying of any pipework
5 inspections and testing during the placing of earthworks, pavement or filter materials
6 inspection and level check of the prepared SuDS component before planting begins
686 Part E: Supporting guidance
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
7 inspection of completed SuDS after surfacing or planting
final inspection before handover, to ensure that all construction silt has been removed, the final
construction is in accordance with the design and there are no visible defects.
The contractor installing the SuDS scheme should be made fully aware of the requirement for
inspections, to avoid work being undertaken that cannot be validated. Final inspection should take place
at the end of the maintenance period as defined in the contract (typically 1 year).
On completion of construction, the approving body or designer should provide a verification report that
discusses the inspections, the reasons for any variations made to the design, any non-compliances that
are identified and how they were rectified. During the first year of operation there may be a need for
monitoring to identify any modifications that may be required to optimise performance, if this has been
required and stated as part of the design. The scope of the monitoring will be site specific and depends
on the sensitivity of the design and the consequences if the SuDS does not perform as expected.
31.8 SUMMARY
In summary the following issues should be considered by those responsible for the design, programming
and construction of SuDS.

Operation and
maintenance
This chapter discusses general good practice for operation and
maintenance activities, and the types of documents that can be
developed to define the reuirements at a particular site
Specific maintenance reuirements for each type of SuS component are listed in
detail towards the end of each of the SuS component chapters hapters
hapter provides further detail on landscape design including planting for ease
of maintenance
hapter provides guidance on waste management including waste resulting
from maintenance
32.1 INTRODUCTION
Many SuDS components are visible on the surface, form part of the overall site
landscape and include a range of habitats. Depending on the design, maintenance
regimes need to take account of the wider landscape context of amenity and
biodiversity, as well as drainage requirements. The maintenance activities required
to deliver the desired amenity, for example, may exceed those required to deliver the
designed water quantity and water quality performance. In such cases, this needs to be
recognised by those responsible for delivering and maintaining that functionality. Where
SuDS components are hard surfaces or below ground, the maintenance will generally
be based on engineering requirements.
For the purpose of this manual, maintenance refers to:
inspections required to identify performance issues and plan appropriate
maintenance needs
operation and maintenance of the drainage system
landscape management
waste management associated with contaminated silt and other waste materials
resulting from maintenance.
All maintenance will need to take the protection of habitats and associated ecology into
account (Chapter 6). Maintenance regimes should be regularly assessed (eg once per
year) to make sure that the approach is still meeting the drainage, landscape and any
other objectives. This may result in changes to the maintenance of a feature or area. For
example, more frequent vegetation management may be identified where vegetation
growth is obstructing highway sight lines.
The function of the surface water management system should be understood by
those responsible for maintenance, regardless of whether individual components are
below ground or on the surface. When problems occur in vegetated components on
the surface, they may be obvious and can be remedied using standard landscape or
engineering practices. However, this is not always the case – particularly with more
complex systems such as bioretention systems and pervious surfaces. If any system
(whether above or below ground) is properly designed, monitored and maintained,
performance deterioration can usually be minimised.
Chapter 32: Operation and maintenance
691
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Ease of maintenance and access is therefore a necessary and important consideration of SuDS design
(not least as part of CDM requirements to ensure that maintenance can be undertaken safely). Sufficient
thought should be given to the likely required maintenance over the design life of the SuDS and its
funding during the feasibility and planning stages of a scheme (Chapter 35). In particular, the following
requirements should be given full consideration:
maintenance access – ensuring appropriate and permanent access to all points in the system where
future maintenance may be required
forebays and/or appropriate pre-treatment systems to help trap sediment
appropriate provision for temporary drainage, if required, during sediment management or other
maintenance activities
the availability of storage and disposal areas for green waste, such as grass cuttings and
organic sediments.
Appropriate legal agreements between adoption and maintenance organisations that define maintenance
responsibilities are presented in Shaffer et al (2004). Maintenance Plans will often be required as a
condition of planning for the site. For example, many buildings are required to achieve a high BREEAM
rating and a landscape management plan (LMP) is a mandatory requirement to achieve this. Planning
authorities will include this in a planning condition.
The LMP can also form a useful tool for public or client engagement with SuDS and help them to
understand the wider benefits of the system. They can include the provision for ecological re-survey, tree
inspection and works and information about how the system delivers multiple benefits.
32.2 OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE MANUAL
Those responsible for SuDS within a development (owner, tenant, local authority, water company etc)
should ideally be provided with an operation and maintenance manual by the designer. This could be part
of the documentation provided under CDM (part of the health and safety file).
If the user of the system is not responsible for maintenance, then it is important to ensure that they know
when the SuDS is not functioning correctly and who to contact if an issue arises, such as a blockage at a
SuDS pond seen by a householder on a housing estate or a tenant on an industrial estate.
The operation and maintenance manual should be succinct and easy to use and should include the
following:
location of all SuDS components on the site
brief summary of the design intent, how the SuDS components work, their purpose and potential
performance risks
depth of silt that will trigger requirement for removal
visual indicators that will trigger maintenance
depth of oil in separators etc that will trigger removal
maintenance requirements (ie the Maintenance Plan) and a maintenance record pro forma
explanation of the objectives of the maintenance proposed and potential implications of not meeting
those objectives (it may be useful to split this into planted and hard elements, for clarity)
identification of areas where certain activities are prohibited (eg stockpiling materials on
pervious surfaces)
an action plan for dealing with accidental spillages of pollutants
692 Part E: Supporting guidance
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
advice on what to do if alterations are to be made to a development or if service companies need to
undertake excavations or other similar works that could affect the SuDS
details of whom to contact in the event that pollution is seen in the system or if it is not working correctly.
The operation and maintenance manual should also include brief details of the design concepts and
performance criteria for the scheme and how the owner or operator should ensure that any works
undertaken on a development do not compromise this. For example, householders should be made
aware that surface water drainage is connected to soakaways, and be given full details and maintenance
obligations for any rainwater harvesting systems in the property. This education is part of the wider
community engagement process that is vital to the successful uptake of SuDS (Chapter 34). The
operation and maintenance manual may also include the LMP.
It is important on industrial estates to clearly identify to everyone which areas drain to SuDS and which
to foul sewer. For example, gullies and manhole covers could be colour coded or marked. Owner and
tenants should be made aware of what is allowed to drain to the SuDS. Similarly, it is a good idea to use
interpretation boards, for example at a pond on a housing estate, to increase householders’ awareness
of the purpose and benefits of the SuDS and to encourage them not to put polluting substances down the
surface water drainage system (Chapter 27).
32.3 LEVEL OF OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE
There are many factors that will influence the type and frequency of maintenance required for a SuDS
component or scheme at any particular site, including:
the type of SuDS components
the size of the contributing catchment in relation to the area of the SuDS components (this will affect
the likely sediment loading rates and potential for erosion etc)
the land use associated with the contributing catchment (this will affect the likely build-up of
contamination)
the level of continuing construction within the contributing catchment
the SuDS planting scheme
the habitat types that have been created as part of the scheme and how they are anticipated to
evolve into a mature landscape
the amenity and visual requirements of the area.
The demands on the SuDS component or scheme to perform a particular aesthetic function may be a key
driver, with high frequencies of grass cutting and/or other vegetation management often being required
for appearance and amenity value rather than for functional reasons. Specific habitats may dictate the
time of year that is suitable for particular activities to be undertaken (eg reed cutting), and/or the extent
of the system that should be subject to certain activities at any one time (eg sediment removal). Plants
and trees tend to require different periodic management techniques as they mature. This is particularly
relevant to coppice areas and woodland, or indeed shrub and herbaceous planting, some of which may
require renewal after 10 years or so, depending on the planting and its purpose.
The maintenance regime of a site also needs to consider the response to extreme pollution events. A
response action plan should be developed and communicated to all those involved in the operation of a
site, so that if a spillage occurs it can be prevented from causing pollution to receiving waters.
It is recommended that SuDS are not handed over to those responsible for maintenance until upstream
construction has ceased, the contributing catchment has stabilised, and any necessary rehabilitation of
downstream components has been undertaken by the developer/contractor. However, if maintenance
agreements have to be put in place in advance of this time, and the level of construction activity in the
Chapter 32: Operation and maintenance
693
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
contributing catchment is still high, maintenance specifications should be prepared that take account of
high sediment accumulation rates and the increased risks of potential spillages.
32.4 OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE ACTIVITY CATEGORIES
Maintenance activities can be broadly defined as
1 regular maintenance (including inspections) – Section 32.6
2 occasional maintenance – Section 32.7
3 remedial maintenance – Section 32.8.
There may also be initial one-off requirements sometimes referred to as “establishment maintenance”,
particularly for planting (eg weeding and watering). Regular maintenance consists of basic tasks
carried out to a frequent and predictable schedule, including inspections/monitoring, silt or oil removal
if required more frequently than once per year, vegetation management, sweeping of surfaces and litter
and debris removal.
Occasional maintenance comprises tasks that are likely to be required periodically, but on a much less
frequent and predictable basis than the regular tasks (eg sediment removal or filter replacement). Table 32.1
summarises the likely maintenance activities required for each SuDS component, and guidance on specific
maintenance activities is given in the following sections.
Remedial maintenance describes the intermittent tasks that may be required to rectify faults associated
with the system, although the likelihood of faults can be minimised by good design, construction and
regular maintenance activities. Where remedial work is found to be necessary, it is likely to be due
to site-specific characteristics or unforeseen events, and so timings are difficult to predict. Remedial
maintenance can comprise activities such as:
inlet and outlet repairs
erosion repairs
reinstatement or realignment of edgings, barriers, rip-rap or other erosion control
infiltration surface rehabilitation
replacement of blocked filter materials/fabrics
construction stage sediment removal (although this activity should have been undertaken before the
start of the maintenance contract)
system rehabilitation immediately following a pollution event.
It is important to note that these remedial activities will not be required for all systems, but for the purpose
of estimating whole life maintenance costs, a contingency sum of 15–20% should be added to the annual
regular and occasional maintenance costs to cover the risk of these activities being required.

32.5 HEALTH AND SAFETY
To comply with the Construction (Design and Management) Regulations (CDM) 2015, designers must
assess all foreseeable risks during construction and maintenance and the design must minimise them by
the following (in order of preference):
avoid
reduce
identify and mitigate residual risks.
Designers must also make contractors and others aware of risks, in the health and safety file, which
is a record of the key health and safety risks that will need to be managed during future maintenance
work. For example, the file for a SuDS pond should contain information on the collection of haardous
compounds in the sediment, so that maintenance contractors are aware of it and can take appropriate
Chapter 32: Operation and maintenance
695
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
precautions. During construction, the residual risks must be identified and an action plan developed to
deal with them safely (the health and safety plan and site rules).
All those responsible for maintenance should take appropriate health and safety precautions for all
activities (including lone working, if relevant), and risk assessments should always be undertaken.
Guidance on generic health and safety principles is provided in Chapter 36.
32.6 REGULAR MAINTENANCE
32.6.1 Inspections and reporting
An initial pre-handover inspection of the scheme is required, to ensure that it has been constructed as
designed (Chapter 31).
Regular inspections of SuDS will then:
1 help determine optimum future maintenance activities
2 help establish ongoing hydraulic, water quality, amenity and biodiversity performance of the system
allow identification of potential performance failures, such as blockage, reduced infiltration and poor
water quality resulting from lack of maintenance.
Maintenance of SuDS is carried out by a range of people, which can include school caretakers,
highway authorities, facilities management companies and landscape contractors. Pervious surfaces
and proprietary systems will most likely be managed by people familiar with highway or drainage
maintenance. Landscaped systems will be managed by the landscape contractor, although connecting
pipework may be managed by others.
Where the maintenance of a system is carried out by those responsible for the wider landscaped area,
the inspections can generally be undertaken during routine site visits (eg for grass cutting, leaf collection
and/or litter collection) for little extra cost, although there may need to be dedicated visits during some
winter months.
The staff doing the landscape maintenance should have appropriate experience of SuDS maintenance
and should be capable of keeping sufficiently detailed records of any inspections. If staff do not have
appropriate experience, then specific inspection visits will be necessary.
Those with overall responsibility for the drainage system may not be responsible for maintenance of
the wider landscape and in those circumstances specific inspection visits may also be required at a
suitable interval.
Specific visits will also be required if the system includes proprietary treatment systems (Chapter 14).
Whichever arrangements are made, the inspections should be recorded, and the records saved for future
reference (Section 32.10 and Appendix B).
During the first year of operation of all types of SuDS, inspections should usually be carried out at least
monthly (and after significant storm events) to ensure that the system is functioning as designed and that
no damage is evident.
Typical routine inspection questions that will indicate when occasional or remedial maintenance activities
are required for any type of system include:
Are inlets or outlets blocked?
Does any part of the system appear to be leaking (especially ponds and wetlands)?
Is the vegetation healthy?
696 Part E: Supporting guidance
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Is there evidence of poor water quality (eg algae, oils, milky froth, odour, unusual colourings)?
Is there evidence of sediment build-up beyond the designer’s stated limits?
Is there visual evidence of oil accumulation?
Is there evidence of ponding above an infiltration surface
Is there any evidence of structural damage that requires repair?
Are there areas of erosion or channelling over vegetated surfaces?
Is there any visual evidence of regular or unplanned over-topping of banks?
For large sites, it is recommended that an annual maintenance report and record should be prepared
by the maintenance contractor, which should be retained with the operation and maintenance manual
(Section 32.2). The report should provide the following information:
observations resulting from inspections
measured sediment depths (where appropriate)
monitoring results, if flow or water quality monitoring is undertaken
confirmation that any penstocks or valves are free and working correctly
maintenance and operation activities undertaken during the year
recommendations for inspection and maintenance programme for the following year.
As with any paved area, safety inspections of pervious surfaces will be necessary for tripping hazards.
If pervious surfaces are to be used in a shopping centre car park or high footfall area, these should be
inspected monthly as a minimum, and repairs made as necessary through the lifetime of the surface. This
would apply to any type of surface. Guidance is provided by the Road Liaison Group (2005).
32.6.2 Litter and debris removal
Litter and debris removal is an integral part of SuDS maintenance for surface features, in order to reduce
the risks of inlet and outlet blockages, to retain amenity value and to minimise pollution risks. High litter
removal frequencies may be required where aesthetics are a major driver, for example on residential
sites or at high profile commercial or retail parks. Litter removal is less of an issue for engineered or
underground systems, such as pervious surfaces, filter drains and proprietary systems and will normally
form part of routine open space maintenance.
32.6.3 Grass cutting
It is recommended that the grass cutting regime around SuDS components is carefully specified to
maximise the performance of the SuDS and
meet visual requirements. In general, allowing
grass to grow tends to enhance water quality
performance. Short grass around a wet system,
such as a pond or wetland, provides an ideal
habitat for nuisance wildlife species such as
geese, but allowing the grass to grow is an
effective means of discouraging them. Grass
around wet pond or wetland systems should
not be cut to the edge of the permanent water
in order to deter large birds and to reduce the
risks of nutrients associated with grass cuttings
falling into the water.
Grass cutting is an activity primarily undertaken
to enhance the perceived aesthetics of the Figure 32.1 Grass cuttings
Chapter 32: Operation and maintenance
697
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
facility. The frequency of cutting will tend to depend on surrounding land uses, and public requirements.
Grass cutting should be done as infrequently as possible, recognising the aesthetic preferences of local
residents and other landscape management activities required at the site. Visibility around highways
also needs to be considered. Grass around inlet and outlet infrastructure should be strimmed closely to
reduce risks to system performance. If a manicured, parkland effect is required, then cutting will need to
be undertaken more regularly than for meadow type grass areas, the latter aiming to maximise habitat
and biodiversity potential. The impact of grass cutting on soil compaction should also be considered. The
landscape management plan will usually identify the mowing regimes required in different areas or zones.
Guidance on designing a site to ease maintenance, such as limiting the slope of grassed areas, is
provided in Chapter 29.
In the past there have been recommendations that keeping grass short in filter strips and swales prevents
the grass lodging over (ie being pushed over and flattened by the flow of water) and improves pollution
removal. However, the risk of pollution removal being compromised is now considered to be minimal and
there is no reason for a blanket requirement to keep grass short in all swales and filter strips.
32.6.4 Weed and invasive plant control
Weeds are generally defined as vegetation types that are unwanted in a particular area. For SuDS,
weeds can include:
alien or invasive species (ie plants that are particularly aggressive, non-native species), the spread
of which is generally undesirable
plants that negatively affect the technical performance or amenity/biodiversity value of the system.
In some places, weeding has to be done by hand to prevent the destruction of surrounding vegetation
(hand weeding should generally only be required during the first year, during plant establishment).
However, mowing can be an effective weed management measure for grassed areas. Where the use
of herbicides and pesticides is permitted (Chapter 29), this should be limited, where possible, to the
establishment period, as the benefits of rapid sward/plant cover development are likely to outweigh any
potential resulting water quality deterioration. The use of fertilisers should also be limited or prohibited, to
minimise nutrient loadings, which are damaging to water bodies.
Specific advice on weed control for green roofs, filter drains and pervious pavements is provided in
Chapters 12, 16 and 20 respectively.
32.6.5 Shrub management
Shrubs may be densely planted and may mature very rapidly over the first year. They are likely to require
weeding at the base, especially during the first year or two, to ensure that they get enough water, and
mulching to retain water in the soils where possible. Bark mulch around shrubs should not be used, as it
floats and clogs outlets. Pruning shrubs can result in a denser structure and better lateral growth, which
may be desirable in SuDS.
32.6.6 Aquatic and shoreline vegetation management
Aquatic plant aftercare in the first 1 years may be required to ensure establishment of planted
vegetation and to control nuisance weeds and invasive plants. Once it is established, the build-up of dead
vegetation from previous seasons should be removed at convenient intervals (eg every 3 years and at
the end of landscape contract periods) in order to reduce organic silt accumulation. Emergent vegetation
may need to be harvested every 210 years in order to maintain flood attenuation volumes, optimise
water quality treatment potential and ensure fresh growth. Where the density of vegetation is high, annual
removal may be required. Care should be taken to avoid disturbance to nesting birds during the breeding
season and habitats of target species (eg great crested newt and water voles) at critical times. The
window for carrying out maintenance to achieve this is towards the end of the growing season (typically
September and October, but this will vary with species). As vegetation matures, plant height may need
698 Part E: Supporting guidance
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
to be reviewed with respect to any health and safety framework or strategy such as if it blocks necessary
sightlines to an open water feature.
Where emergent vegetation is managed, up to 25% can be removed by cutting at 100 mm above soil
level using shearing action machinery. Up to 25% of submerged vegetation can be cut and raked out at
any one time, using approved rakes, grabs or other techniques, depending on whether clay or waterproof
membranes are present. Aquatic vegetation arisings should be stacked close to the water’s edge for 48
hours to de-water it and allow wildlife to return to the SuDS feature. They should then be removed to wildlife
piles, compost heaps or off site before decomposition, rotting or damage to existing vegetation can occur.
Algae removal may be undertaken for aesthetic purposes during the first 5 years of a pond/wetland’s
life. The growth of algae, which is considered by some to be visually intrusive, is encouraged by nutrients
introduced into the water body. This situation should settle down once upstream construction activities
are complete.
32.6.7 Sweeping pervious surfaces
Pervious surfaces need to be regularly cleaned of silt and other sediments to preserve their infiltration
capacity. Typically this will be required no more than once per year and often less, where inspections
indicate that it is not required. Refer to Chapter 20 for details of this process.
i remoa and eanin or reain fiters in rorietar sstems
Oil removal from proprietary treatment systems should be undertaken at intervals recommended by
the manufacturer. This will depend on the catchment characteristics. On small sites with a low pollution
hazard, small amounts of oil may be removed by skimming, using small van-mounted equipment. This
is relatively inexpensive. Those serving larger, more heavily polluted catchments may require tankers to
remove the accumulated oil.
Where proprietary systems use filters, they should be replaced or cleaned at the intervals recommended
by the manufacturer. For example, the coalescing filters in an oil separator can require cleaning every 6
months if the runoff from the catchment has a high oil load (eg from a heavily used road).
32.7 OCCASIONAL MAINTENANCE
32.7.1 Sediment removal
To ensure the long-term performance of SuDS,
the sediment that accumulates in treatment
components should be removed periodically
(whether landscaped or proprietary systems).
The required frequency of sediment removal is
dependent on many factors including:
design of upstream drainage system
type of system
design silt storage volume
size of upstream catchment in relation to
surface area of SuDS component
characteristics of upstream catchment
area (eg land use, level of imperviousness,
Figure 32.2 Boards)
upstream construction activities, erosion
control management and effectiveness of upstream pre-treatment).
De-silting (courtesy Bedford Group of Drainage
Chapter 32: Operation and maintenance
699
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Sediment accumulation will typically be rapid for the entire construction period (including during the
period of building, turfing and landscaping of all upstream development plots). Once a catchment
is completely developed and all vegetation is well-established, sediment mobility (erosion) and
accumulation is likely to drop significantly.
Detailed information on waste management (in particular with respect to sediment removal) is provided in
Chapter 33.
For most small features, sediment can be removed either by hand or using small excavators. For any
system that has a waterproof liner, the method of sediment removal should be chosen so there is minimal
risk of damaging the liner.
For proprietary treatment systems, a suction tanker will be needed to remove the sediment. The size of
tanker will depend on the scale of the proprietary system and its location. For small catchments using
treatment channels, silt accumulation in the channel can often be removed with hand tools or a small
suction tanker.
General sediment removal considerations
Sediment removal from SuDS systems should always be carried out such that no damage is caused
to the SuDS, and impacts on ecological systems and aesthetic appearance are minimised. The
appropriate method of sediment removal at a particular site will depend on the size of the SuDS
component, the access, whether the sediments are submerged or lying on dry ground, the sediment
properties, the design characteristics of the SuDS component, visual requirements and wildlife
concerns and sediment depths.
For small source-control SuDS components where sediment volumes are likely to be small, it is
usually appropriate to remove sediment using hand tools and appropriate protective equipment. Where
components and associated sediment volumes are larger, or where the sediment has accumulated in a
permanent water body, then mechanical equipment may be required.
In particular, it is recommended to do the following:
1 Establish how the structure is lined and avoid damage to clay puddle layers or waterproof membranes.
2 Undertake work between September and March to minimise impacts on receiving water bodies (high
suspended solids can cause reduced dissolved oxygen levels, which causes particular problems
during elevated summer temperatures). Where required, works may be restricted to September and
October, in order to protect breeding or hibernating wildlife.
3 Where machinery or pumping is to be used, agree the sediment removal and management plan in
advance with the environmental regulator.
4 Where machinery is used to excavate sediment, undertake the operation in dry weather when the
surrounding ground is firm, and ideally operate from a hard surface.
5 Use machinery with an extending arm to avoid contact with edges, banks and other features within
a minimum distance of 1 m from the edge. Use a bucket without teeth to avoid puncturing clay layers
or waterproof membranes.
6 Secure consent for any de-watering operations with the environmental regulator, if required.
Specific requirements of different SuDS components are presented in subsequent sections. Individual
SuDS component chapters should be referenced for further details.
Sediment removal from retention ponds
Ponds and wetlands may eventually accumulate sufficient sediment to impact on the storage capacity
of the permanent pool. This loss of capacity can affect both the appearance and the pollution removal
efficiency of the pond. The rate at which this occurs will depend on allowances made during storage
700 Part E: Supporting guidance
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
capacity design. The loss in storage will occur
more rapidly if the pond receives additional
sediment input during the construction phase.
The accumulation of sediment should be
monitored and where it is significant and/or if
the quality in the pond begins to deteriorate,
sediment characterisation should be
undertaken to establish the need and options
for its removal.
The following issues should be considered:
1 Regular partial sediment removal is most
effective, but may not be economic.
However, where possible, sediment should
not be removed from more than 50% of the
pond or wetland area at any one time.
Figure 32.3 (courtesy Land & Water)
Floating excavator working in small pond
2 Appropriate bankside working areas should be selected, and wetland and bankside habitats protected.
Sufficient vegetation should be retained to ensure rapid re-colonisation of damaged areas.
4 Ideally, sediment removal should remove only accumulated inorganic and organic sediment, but not
wetland subsoil or topsoil layers. In practice, this can be difficult to achieve.
Specialist contractors should generally undertake sediment removal from ponds or wetlands. The types
of machines capable of removing sediment from a pond will vary. It may be possible to drain the pond and
employ a mini excavator or excavator with swamp tracks to excavate sediments from within the feature,
or else an excavator may have to be deployed from the bank. Standard hydraulic excavators have limited
reach, but are normally sufficient to deal with removal from small features within sites. For large ponds, a
long-reach excavator may be required that can reach up to 25 m.
A further option that may occasionally be necessary is to use machinery on floating pontoons and/or
barges. Figure 32.2 shows a floating excavator working in water.
For safety reasons excavators cannot operate close to overhead power lines and they need a clear area
to swing their bucket and dump spoil. This should be taken into account when assessing the access
required for maintenance (eg if a pond is surrounded by trees or buildings).
If de-watering of ponds in advance of sediment extraction is feasible at a site, and assuming that
the water body can be left drained for a reasonable period of time (ie a few weeks), then this can
considerably reduce the volume of material to be extracted and that will require disposal, and will often
allow some biodegradation of organic material.
De-watering can be undertaken by:
1 draining down the pond using the penstock or outlet valve (if included within the design)
2 pumping out the pond.
Both options require consideration of the environmental impact of the de-watering, especially with respect
to downstream receiving waters, which could be a sewer, watercourse or other water body. In some
cases, water pumped from ponds or settlement channels has to be tankered off site. Discharge to a
watercourse or body is likely to require discharge consent from the environmental regulator. Consent from
the sewerage undertaker will be required if the discharge is to a sewer, and large-scale de-watering may
also require planning permission. Testing of the system water quality (for COD, BOD, suspended solids
and metals – in consultation with the environmental regulator) may be required to demonstrate the likely
risks to the local environment and this can be undertaken together with the sediment sampling.
Chapter 32: Operation and maintenance
701
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
The water may contain high concentrations of suspended solids that are either already in suspension
or become entrained as a result of the pumping process. Adequate sediment control should therefore
be provided before the pumped water is discharged. Once the pumped water is running clear then the
sediment control devices may be bypassed as long as sediment is not reintroduced into the system.
Appropriate sediment control systems include:
temporary traps formed by constructing an earth embankment with a gravel filled outlet across a swale
sediment basins (this can include the use of floodable fields)
sumps (either constructed or mobile proprietary units)
geotextile filters.
A dump truck with a watertight tailgate is likely to be required to remove the sediment from the site.
Sediment removal from detention basins
Dry basins accumulate sediment with time that will gradually reduce the storage capacity available and
can in some cases also reduce sediment trapping efficiency. Also, sediment may tend to accumulate
around the control device, which increases the risk that either the orifice may become clogged or that
sediment may become re-entrained into the outflow. Where basins are amenity features, sediment
accumulation is likely to be unsightly and reduce the amenity value of the component. Sediment
accumulation should be monitored as part of the inspection regime for the surface water management
system and appropriate frequencies determined for removal and disposal. Small volumes of sediment
can usually be removed by landscape contractors using hand tools. Sediment excavation using front-end
loaders or backhoes is simple, if appropriate access is available for the equipment. Sediment removal will
usually damage the vegetation, and re-establishment may be required.
Sediment remoa from fiter stris and saes
Sediment accumulation should be monitored as part of the inspection regime for the surface water
management system and appropriate frequencies determined for removal and disposal. Filter strips
and swales will only accumulate very small volumes of sediment which can be removed by landscape
contractors using hand tools at appropriate frequencies depending on the impact of the accumulation on
the performance of the component in terms of hydraulics (eg sheet flow characteristics), water quality (eg
vegetation cover) and amenity (eg visual).
Sediment remoa from infitration basins
Infiltration basins should always have source control, a pre-treatment or other sediment trapping system
upstream. Even with low sediment loads, the system performance can still become significantly impaired in
a relatively short space of time. The sediment deposits reduce the storage capacity and may also clog the
surface soils. Dense vegetation can minimise the risk of surface clogging (Chapter 13, Section 13.12).
Methods of removing sediment from infiltration basins are different from detention basins. Removal
should not start until the basin has dried out, at which point the top layer should then be removed using
lightweight equipment, with care being taken not to unduly compact the basin surface. The remaining
soil can then be scarified or tilled to restore the surface infiltration capacity (see Chapter 13 for detail
of these methods). Vegetated areas disturbed during sediment removal should be replanted or re-sown
immediately to reduce the risk of erosion. Suitable erosion control should also be provided.
Sediment removal from proprietary systems
Proprietary systems should be cleaned out regularly to prevent re-entry of any residuals or pollutants into
the downstream system. The frequency will depend on the site-specific pollutant load, but most suppliers/
manufacturers recommend that cleaning operations should take place every 6 months. They can be
cleaned by vacuum pumping which transfers a slurry of water and sediment to a tanker, or by adding
chemicals to help solidify the residuals, which can then be removed using appropriate methods.
702 Part E: Supporting guidance
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Maintenance of pervious pavement systems involves removing sediment from the pavement surface
using vacuum sweeping. It is recommended that the pavement be vacuum swept once a year, and the
collected sediments will require appropriate handling and disposal.
Sediment remoa from fiter drains
Filter drains will require occasional removal of the gravel infill which can be either cleaned and reused,
or new material used as a replacement. The geotextile surrounds to the trench and to pipes may also
require replacement at this time.
Small lengths would probably be cleaned using a small excavator to remove the material and replace it
with clean. There are specialist companies that can clean long lengths of linear filter drain (eg alongside
roads) using specialist machinery. The machinery can easily deal with single size material of 40 mm and
Type B filter material (Chapter 30). It may require adapting, or the settings changed to deal with other infill
materials. The machinery lifts the filter material from the trench, segregates and cleans it and then returns
it to the trench. Typically the machines will clean the gravel to depths of 300 mm or exceptionally 600 mm.
Disposal of silt and debris that is removed is achieved via a belt which can discharge to a truck running
alongside, or it can be deposited well back on the verge if permitted. The amount of spoil is usually in the
order of 5–10 tonnes for every 100 m of drain cleaned to 300 mm depth.
32.7.2 Vegetation and plant replacement
Some replacement of plants may be required in the first 12 months after installation (ie the defects
liability/rectification period), possibly after storm events. Dead or damaged plants should be removed and
replaced, to restore the prescribed number of living plants per m2. The responsibility for doing this should
be made clear in the construction contract.
Inspection programmes should identify areas of filtration, or infiltration surfaces where vegetation growth
is poor and likely to cause a reduced level of system performance. Such areas can then be rehabilitated,
and plant growth repaired.
32.8 REMEDIAL MAINTENANCE
32.8.1 Structure rehabilitation and repair
The need for component rehabilitation (eg to remove clogged filters, geotextiles and gravels) will typically
be 10–25 years, depending on the component design and factors such as the type of catchment and
sediment load. The SuDS design should allow for vehicle access to undertake this work and consider
how to implement such overhauls without causing major disruption to the functionality of the drainage
system. For example, if geotextiles are used at a high level within a pervious surface, then reconstruction
of the surface and bedding layer is all that is required if they become clogged, rather than reconstruction
of the whole pavement depth.
Some form of rehabilitation is likely to be required at some point where component functionality relies
on filtration through soils or aggregates. However, for many SuDS components, routine maintenance
is sufficient.
Rehabilitation activities for each SuDS component are described in the individual component chapters.
The requirements should be identified in the operation and maintenance manual.
nfitration surfae rehabiitation
Inspections should look for signs of infiltration surfaces becoming clogged, such as if water is standing for
long periods on the surface or if it is flowing via an overflow channel and bypassing the basin. In the event
that grassed surface permeability is unacceptably reduced, there are a number of landscape techniques
that can be used to open the surface to encourage infiltration. Such activities are likely to be required in
Chapter 32: Operation and maintenance
703
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
circumstances where silt has not been effectively managed upstream, or the infiltration surface has been
compacted by foot traffic (eg if a basin is also used as a recreational area).
Scarifying to remove “thatch”
Thatch is a tightly intermingled organic layer of dead and living shoots, stems and roots, developing
between the zone of green vegetation and the soil surface. Scarifying with tractor-drawn or self-propelled
equipment to a depth of at least 50 mm breaks up silt deposits, removes dead grass and other organic
matter and relieves compaction of the soil surface.
Siin or tinin the soi usin aeratin euiment to enourae ater eroation
This is particularly effective where a hollow tine machine is used, and sand is dressed in, and is best
undertaken when the soil is moist (note: the removal and disposal of the dried cores will be necessary).
Spiking or tining with tractor-drawn or self-propelled equipment penetrates and perforates soil layers to a depth
of at least 100 mm (at 100 mm centres) and allows the entry of air, water, nutrients and top dressing materials.
Air pressure treatment
If the infiltration capacity has reduced due to compaction, it may be possible to rehabilitate it using air
pressure treatment. This process breaks up subsoil layers by driving probes into the ground. The probe is
connected to a high pressure gas source (typically nitrogen bottles) and a high pressure stream of gas is
quickly introduced into the soil. This causes the soil to rupture both vertically and horizontally.
As a last resort, it may be necessary to remove and replace the grass and topsoil by:
removing accumulated silt and (subject to a toxicity test) applying to land or dispose off site
removing damaged turf, which should be composted or disposed off site
cultivating remaining topsoil to required levels
re-turfing (using turf of a quality and appearance to match existing) or reseeding (to Clause 12.6 of
BS 7370-3:1991) using seed to match existing turf) area to required levels. It may be necessary to
supply and fix erosion protection to protect seeded soil. The placing or grading of turf and seeded
areas should be undertaken carefully to ensure that final design levels are achieved. Watering will be
required to promote successful germination and/or establishment.
32.9 FREQUENCY OF MAINTENANCE TASKS
Landscape maintenance contract periods are usually of 1–3 years in duration. The 3-year cycle is
increasingly common to ensure continuity and commitment to long-term landscape care. The frequency
of regular landscape maintenance tasks in a contract period can range from daily to once in the contract
period. In practice, most site tasks are based on monthly or fortnightly site visits, except where grass or
weed growth requires a higher frequency of work. In many cases, a performance specification is used
with terms such as “beds shall be maintained weed-free” or “grass shall be cut to a height of 50 mm with
a minimum height of 35 mm and a maximum height of 100 mm” to obtain the required standards.
Frequency can be specified within the schedule to include occasional items, such as meadow grass’
cut twice annually in July and September to a height of 75–100 mm (or to supplier’s recommendations),
all arisings raked off and removed to wildlife features, compost facility or other recycling facility”, which
provides flexibility for work that is not critical to the management of the site.
Maintenance tasks that suit a performance approach commonly include plant growth, grass cutting,
pruning and tree maintenance. However, work tasks, such as sweeping paths, regular litter collection
and cleaning road surfaces, will require work at an agreed frequency, with more specific timings such as
weekly, monthly or annually. Where the frequency and timing of tasks is critical, a mixture of performance
and frequency specification is necessary to provide effective maintenance.
704 Part E: Supporting guidance
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
SuDS maintenance generally tends towards a frequency requirement to ensure a predictable standard
of care, which can be recorded on site and provides a reasonable basis for pricing work. A convenient
frequency for many tasks is at a monthly inspection, as this is the usual minimum site attendance
required in a landscape specification. The monthly frequency should provide for an inspection of all
SuDS components and for the checking of all inlets and outlets. The inspection should be carried out by
someone familiar with the operation of the specific SuDS components, and it should be recorded.
However, certain SuDS maintenance tasks fall outside this monthly cycle and need to be accommodated
in the contract. The most obvious are:
wetland vegetation maintenance
silt management
filter replacement in proprietary systems
sweeping of pervious surfaces (unless loose, gravel surfaces).
There are other tasks associated with ensuring the long-term performance of the systems that may
be more difficult to predict, and may even fall outside any contract period. It may, therefore, be more
appropriate to review requirements, for example, for system rehabilitation at interim periods, when
contracts are falling due for renewal.
The vast majority of well-designed SuDS, whether “hard” or “soft”, do not seem to suffer from problems
with excessive and rapid silt accumulation, if they apply the key concepts of the SuDS philosophy: source
control with a correctly designed Management Train. The frequency of sediment removal will increase
as the area of the catchment increases in relation to the surface area of the SuDS where sediment
accumulates (whether this is within a proprietary system or a landscape feature).
32.10 APPLYING THE PRINCIPLES OF LANDSCAPE MANAGEMENT
Typical landscape management documentation and its potential application to SuDS is summarised in the
following subsections.
32.10.1 Management plan
This document should include a clear statement of design intent and an explanation of each of the SuDS
components and the benefits being delivered by the SuDS for the site. The document should describe the
management objectives for the site over time, and the management strategies that should be employed to
realise these objectives and reconcile any potential conflicts that may arise.
Where the drainage system has an impact on the wildlife value or public use of a site, the
document should explain any habitat enhancement goals, health and safety issues and long-term
management implications.
For SuDS, the management plan should include a Maintenance Plan, which will be required so that
maintenance aspirations can be costed, in order to secure their long-term financing. The Maintenance
Plan can also establish changes in maintenance regimes that may be required to match changes in
objectives such as the need to adapt operation and maintenance practices to accommodate specific
wildlife habitats that may develop.
Sites with special wildlife or amenity interest may require detailed management plans that monitor habitat
development, infrastructure changes or damage to sites, and ensure rapid responses to such changes,
should they occur. In these cases the management plan should be prepared in collaboration with an
ecologist. Ecological supervision may be required for certain works.
It is common for smaller commercial, industrial and housing sites to have a simple maintenance
statement. In this case, a single page explaining the site management (including the SuDS) would be
useful for all parties involved in the care of the development.
Chapter 32: Operation and maintenance
705
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
An important part of a management plan is an annual and 3–5 yearly review of the Maintenance Plan
(when maintenance contracts are typically renewed). This should apply to all types of SuDS, but is
particularly important for the soft landscape element, as plants and trees require different periodic
management techniques as they develop. The review should involve those responsible for the
maintenance and those undertaking the work.
The management plan should be a living document that is reviewed periodically with reference to
changes on site, as well as changes to adjacent sites that might impact the site.
Further guidance and an example of a Maintenance Plan (in the form of a checklist) is provided in
Appendix B.
32.10.2 Conditions of Contract
Appropriate conditions of contract will be required. Advice can be sought from the Landscape Institute which
publishes specific landscape maintenance contracts. Guidance is also provided in Shaffer et al (2004).
Seifiation
The specification details the materials to be used and the standard of work required.
A specification, usually preceded by preliminaries, details how work shall be carried out, and contains
clauses that give general instructions to the contractor. It will normally be accompanied by a schedule of
work (Section 32.10.4). Specific SuDS maintenance clauses may be included in a general specification
or as a separate SuDS maintenance specification section either within or referenced by the
management plan (Section 32.10.1).
32.10.4 Schedule of work
The schedule of work itemises the tasks to be undertaken and the frequency at which they will be performed.
The tasks required to maintain the site and the frequency necessary to achieve an acceptable standard
should be set out in the schedule of work.
This document (and Section 32.10.3) will often form the basis of a pricing framework, and can also act as
a checklist to ensure that the work has been carried out satisfactorily.
For further information on the development of appropriate schedules, see HR Wallingford (2004).
32.10.5 Maintenance record
It is vital that a record is kept of the inspections and maintenance work that has been carried out. This
allows the response of the system to different maintenance regimes to be assessed in future, and also
provides protection against legal claims should the capacity of the system be exceeded during a rainfall
event and flooding occurs elsewhere as a result.

Waste management
This chapter discusses the principles of good practice for the
management of waste resulting from maintenance of SuDS.
33.1 INTRODUCTION
SuDS remove pollutants from runoff, thereby minimising the impacts on receiving water
quality. A key part of this process is sediment management. Sediment accumulates in
SuDS for two main reasons:
surface water runoff brings debris and silt loadings from hard surfaces
green areas and vegetated systems generate organic waste, due to plant growth
and die-off.
If sediment is not removed from the drainage system at appropriate frequencies, there
is a risk that the following problems could develop:
1 SuDS components can become sources of pollutants as the inorganic and organic
sediments that accumulate on their base become resuspended during storm events.
2 Storage capacity may be reduced.
3 The risk of inlets and outlets blocking may increase.
4 Amenity and aesthetic value could decrease because of odours and vectors
(organisms that carry disease-causing microorganisms from one host to another).
To prevent these problems, SuDS (and their pre-treatment structures, if present) should
be periodically inspected, the level of sediment (and other waste) accumulation should
be monitored and the systems cleaned when appropriate. Sediment and vegetation that
is grown in components where contaminant loadings are high may contain a variety of
pollutants, and proper handling and disposal of these materials is essential.
Materials such as sediment, vegetation, contaminated geotextiles and other structural
material arising from the maintenance of SuDS may be classified as controlled wastes
and where this is the case, their removal and disposal must always be in accordance
with the latest regulations and legislation. This chapter refers to legislation that is
current at the time of writing (2015), but may be amended over time. It is, therefore,
the responsibility of the SuDS operator to keep abreast of the latest information and
requirements. The environmental regulator should be contacted to confirm the required
protocols for the proper handling of any sediment or other waste at a particular site.
33.2 WASTE MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS
33.2.1 General
There are usually three types of waste arising from regular SuDS maintenance: litter,
green waste (vegetation) and sediment. Litter should be disposed of as for any open
space. Green waste management is described in Section 33.2.2 and sediment
management is described in Section 33.2.3.
Directive 2008/98/EC (the Waste Framework Directive) requires all member states
to take the necessary measures to ensure that waste is recovered or disposed of
Chapter 33: Waste management
709
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
without endangering human health or causing harm to the environment. This includes requirements for
permitting, registration and inspection of waste disposal facilities and operations.
UK waste legislation is derived predominantly from European Union (EU) laws and transposed into UK
law via various statutory instruments specific to England and Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland. The
current regulatory constraints and obligations for waste management and disposal should be established
through consultation with the environmental regulator.
The guidance on complying with the latest regulations is summarised on the following websites:
England and Wales: https://www.gov.uk/waste-legislation-and-regulations
Scotland: www.sepa.org.uk/waste.aspx
Northern Ireland www.doeni.gov.uk/waste
Where waste is removed from site, it will be subject to the relevant waste management legislation for the
country. In brief, this generally means that those responsible for generating waste must:
1 adequately characterise and describe the waste to allow for its safe disposal
2 only allow the waste to be removed and transported by those who are licensed to do so
3 ensure that it is disposed at a suitably licensed waste disposal or treatment facility.
The producer of the waste will be required to undertake analysis of the waste, including the CEN leaching
test, so as to properly characterise the waste as haardous, non-haardous or inert, to assign a classification
in accordance with the European List of Wastes (EC, 2000) and to provide a full description for the receiving
landfill. There is a further requirement to pre-treat haardous waste for volume reduction, to make it non-
reactive and to improve its physical stability. A landfill can only accept waste provided that the appropriate
waste acceptance criteria are met. More information is available from the WRAP website: www.wrap.org.uk
If wastes arising from the maintenance of SuDS are to be disposed of through beneficial reuse, the
proposed activity will need to meet the requirements of an appropriate exemption and, having done so,
be registered. The exemption registration process requires a burden of proof in demonstrating that the
conditions of the particular exemption are met and that the activity is unlikely to cause pollution of the
environment or harm to human health.
Waste disposal options that may be possible include the following:
Non-contaminated sediments or sediments with low levels of contamination arising from SuDS could
possibly be placed on the land surrounding the SuDS (without planning permission), provided that
(1) the disposal area is within the operational land of the SuDS owner (2) the land is not used for
agriculture and (3) it can be demonstrated that the deposit results in an ecological improvement to
the land. See EA position statement requirements (Section 33.3).
Green waste may be composted on site under an appropriate exemption. Alternatively, green wastes
may be collected by a commercial operator for processing into compost at their own site.
If SuDS could be excavated in the dry, then recovered sediments could be beneficially reused as
building material, for example to raise banks or for other landscaping. However, if wet excavation
occurs, the material can only be used in land drainage works.
Direct dredging of the sediments to the surrounding banks may be possible if there is demonstrable
benefit to agriculture or ecology.
The waste disposal route and proposals should always be confirmed with the environmental regulator
before sediment or green waste is removed from the site or applied onto land within it.
In some landscape features with specific habitats, sediment removal operations may require adequate
method statements that are prepared in liaison with an ecologist. The method statement should take
710 Part E: Supporting guidance
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
account of the time of year, sequence of operations on site and disposal of waste. In some places, waste
material may need to be retained on site for a period of time to manage movement and relocation of
invertebrates. Adequate time and resources may also have to be allocated, to transplant vegetation in
sensitive zones.
33.2.2 Green waste management
The relevant waste management regulations must be followed when removing and disposing of green
waste. Where green waste is cut from areas subject to low levels of contaminants, it may be possible to
compost and reuse it.
Larger corporate sites or public open spaces and communal residential land with dedicated management
facilities may incorporate composting facilities of a suitable scale using contained structures/bins (with
ventilation) or open bays. For efficient compost management, at least two or three bins/bays are required,
and the compost needs to be mixed/turned by suitable machinery (eg JCB bucket) at a regular frequency
(see below).
A compost facility allows all green waste, particularly grass cuttings and prunings, to be recycled and
to provide compost for mulching ornamental plant beds. The following process should be followed for
composting:
shred all arisings from site
combine all arisings in active compost bin with grass cuttings not exceeding 70%
turn and mix active compost when bin is > 50% full, at weekly intervals for at least 4 weeks
turn and mix full bin every 28 days until used
combine adjacent compost bins/bays when contents are settled to 50% volume reduction
use compost after 3–4 months.
Where there is no facility for composting on site, green waste can be removed to an off-site dedicated
composting facility where the material is used to make compost to PAS 100:2011 or to the Compost
Quality Protocol by EA (2012). Any third-party sites need to be appropriately permitted.
Some prunings (supplemented with occasional grass and other non-woody cuttings during the summer)
can be used to create or enhance hibernaculae or other facilities on the development site, where this is
part of the landscape or biodiversity strategy. Such facilities can provide refuges, hibernation shelter, food
and egg laying sites for a large number of animals (commonly known as wildlife piles) (RSPB, 2015).
33.2.3 Sediment management
Silt/sediment collected from a SuDS component will often contain low levels of metals, hydrocarbons and
other pollutants.
Any sediment removed from SuDS must meet the requirements of relevant waste management legislation.
The Environment Agency has adopted a risk-based approach in relation to removal of sediment from
SuDS in England and Wales (EA, 2011), but at the time of writing there is no comparable SuDS-specific
approach in Scotland or Northern Ireland.
The approach within the position statement can be summarised as follows:
1 Evaluate whether the silt/sediment collected in the system is likely to have a high risk of being
defined as haardous waste. This will mainly be based on the land use within the catchment (eg
industrial or heavy vehicle management areas or end-of-pipe ponds without source control; basins
etc without source control).
Chapter 33: Waste management
711
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
2 If this is the case, then proceed to haardous waste disposal. This will require chemical analysis of
the silt and compliance with all relevant legislation and guidance.
3 Where there is low risk of pollution (eg housing, schools, commercial sites with source control) then
a sustainable approach to waste management should be agreed with the environmental regulator.
This may require confirmation of the levels of contaminants but, provided that they are below
acceptable limits, should allow removal and land application to suitable vegetated surfaces outside the
SuDS design profile but still close by (eg within 20 m of the SuDS component). For any adverse silt
accumulation in wetlands and ponds (this should be very low if effective source control/pre-treatment
is in place), the material should be removed, allowed to de-water by the side of the SuDS component
for 24–48 hours and then land applied in a similar manner. These activities will need consideration
of the potential impacts to amenity (particularly aesthetic) and biodiversity performance, and specific
constraints (eg relating to protected species and specific habitats, Chapter 32).
If land application is not appropriate for low-risk sites, the sediment will have to be disposed off site. If
material is removed off site, the site owner and those carrying out the work must comply with the required
legislation (Section 33.2.1).
The waste disposal route and proposals should be confirmed with the environmental regulator before silt
is removed from site.
33.3 SEDIMENT CHARACTERISATION AND DISPOSAL
Sediments in surface water runoff have properties that are site specific, and it is extremely difficult to give
typical sediment characteristics. The surface layer (approximately the top 5 cm) is likely to be high in
organic matter, have a high water content, and a low density.
Testing for the presence, concentration and toxicity of metals in both the UK and the USA has indicated
that extracted sediments tend to be non-haardous to human health as defined by current standards
(environmental quality standards). Nutrient concentrations in pond sediments are generally significantly
lower than nutrient concentrations found in combined sewer overflows. Currently, there are few datasets
available on the presence of total petrohydrocarbon (TPH) and polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)
concentrations in sediments. Urban surface water sediments may also contain bacteria and viruses,
including faecal streptococcus and faecal coliform from animal and human wastes – particularly where
there are foul sewer misconnections in the catchment.
Surface water runoff may also contain traces of fertilisers, herbicides and household substances such as
paints and cleaning materials, which may contain substances that are potentially hazardous.
Sediment disposal options will depend largely on the concentrations of the pollutants in the sediment.
The decision-making process is summarised in Figure 33.1. This flowchart applies to sites where the EA
position statement (the deposit and de-watering of non-hazardous sites from SuDS on land) does not
apply. The EA (2011) position statement allows the land application of sediment from SuDS in low-risk
sites (to an area outside the design profile of the SuDS).

Community engagement
This chapter provides an overview of good practice, including two case
studies for SuDS schemes.
Many other documents are available that provide more detailed guidance on
community engagement in general or for other water related projects, including Daly
et al (2015a and 2015b), EA (nd) and Cornell (2006).
34.1 INTRODUCTION – WHAT IS COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT?
Community engagement is a planned process of working with specific groups of
people (connected by location, particular interests or membership of an organisation)
to address issues affecting their local environment and to unlock opportunities to
improve it. It can take many forms and cover a broad range of activities, which (in the
SuDS context) will help to ensure that the community understands and engages with
proposals that are intended to benefit them, such as reducing flood risk (Section 34.2).
Effective community engagement requires a broad section of the community to
participate. This can be encouraged if the process is open, welcoming to all members of
the community, has clear goals and is well organised.
SuDS can be integrated within new developments to deliver drainage as part of
attractive sustainable environments or retrofitted into existing development to address
flooding or sewerage capacity problems experienced within the community. These two
types of project have different needs and outcomes from community engagement
For new build, pre-project engagement will focus on the impact and integration of
the proposed development (including the SuDS) and the new community on those
already living in or visiting the area. It is essential that new owners are informed that
their property is drained by SuDS, and how the drainage works. However, once new
residents move in, there may then be considerable benefit for the developer/SuDS
owner in engaging with them, so that they understand how their system functions, its
importance, its maintenance requirements and any charges or responsibilities that
may fall to them. This could also be an opportunity to address any specific concerns
they may have, for example relating to health and safety (Chapter 36).
or retrofit semes, pre-project engagement will tend to be more focused on the
objectives of the scheme, the needs of the existing community and potential design
options. This is necessary to ensure that the final scheme maximises benefits
for the community, to secure support and acceptance by the community before
implementation, and to encourage participation in any maintenance requirements
following construction.
While SuDS is the focus of this document, it is likely that in some situations SuDS may
only be a minor part of a larger development, surface water or flood risk management
project that requires community engagement.
Community engagement can take many forms and can cover a broad range of
activities. In general terms, engagement can take one or more of the following forms,
and sometimes can progress from one to the next as the project develops
Informin the community about a planned project (eg a new development
nearby or a planned retrofit surface water management scheme) is not true
Chapter 34: Community engagement
717

engagement, although it is sometimes necessary, and can be used in the preparatory stages of an
engagement process.
onsultin the community can be part of a process to develop plans/design options for a project or
activity, or to build community awareness and understanding around a particular issue (eg regarding
health and safety concerns over new bodies of open water close to their homes).
Inolin the community in a project (eg a SuDS planting day, setting up a SuDS maintenance group,
or initiating an environmental group linked to the SuDS flora and fauna) or activity can help to ensure
that their issues and concerns are understood and considered as part of the decision-making process
(eg a local SuDS discussion group that includes the designers and promoters of the scheme).
ollaoratin with the community to develop partnerships can then be used to develop options
and provide recommendations around the project or initiative (eg inputs to setting the required
maintenance regime, mechanisms for raising concerns over the performance of the system, or
designs for a range of potential retrofit options).
moerin the community can enable them to make informed decisions and to implement and
manage change (eg educating the community about sustainability issues and how managing surface
water in the right way can protect the environment and deliver benefits to them).
The form of engagement undertaken will depend on what the engaging organisation wishes to achieve,
either as an end result or at a particular stage in the engagement process (Section 34.4.1).
Understanding what level of participation is needed is also important and will determine the most
appropriate way to go about it (Section 34.3).
34.2 THE BENEFITS OF SUCCESSFUL ENGAGEMENT
Where community engagement is most successful, both the community and the engaging organisation
will benefit.
ommunit benefits
A well-planned community engagement process should ensure that a wide diversity of opinions are heard
and considered in the process, so that the community as a whole feels that its input is valued.
Benefits for the community may include the following
Communities can be assisted to identify priorities for themselves, such as which parts of an estate
need to be retrofitted first, if a project is undertaken in phases.
The engagement process provides a mechanism for increasing a community’s knowledge of
environmental and sustainability issues, and is an opportunity to learn for themselves and their
families. Communities can use the process as a trigger to facilitate the setting up of environmental/
SuDS working groups to help inspect, maintain or promote educational initiatives relating to the
biodiversity associated with the scheme.
Engagement can help develop a local voice, and establish a longer-term input to local decision making.
Where a community shares in the decision-making process, they are much more likely to take
ownership of the outcome, whether it is related to a current flooding problem or plans to make their
community more resilient for the future.
Participating in the engagement process can foster a greater sense of belonging and overall
community cohesion, with benefits beyond the remit of a specific engagement.
Ultimately, individuals may become empowered through the process, and become a proactive part of
the group determining the issues affecting their community or by leading community initiatives.

CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
enefits for the enain oranisation
The benefits for the engaging organisation (plus client and funders) from an effective community
engagement exercise can be substantial, not only benefiting the specific project but the organisation
more generally too. Community engagement can often be seen as a risky and difficult aspect of a project,
but if undertaken well and when started early in the design process, it can add real value, and enable the
project to proceed more smoothly.
Benefits for the engaging organisation may include the following
Community input can ensure that the proposals are framed to suit the community’s preferences, as
well as delivering the overall objectives of the scheme.
Potential issues of community concern, particularly around subjects such as safety or parking,
are likely to be identified earlier in the process, thereby increasing the likelihood of a viable and
acceptable scheme.
Community understanding of the purpose and function of the drainage system is important in
educating the public to embrace the inclusion of SuDS and to encourage them to take ownership
and potentially to be involved in its longer-term maintenance
Engaging with communities can enable the organisation to explore ways in which they can work
more closely on issues of concern to the community. These concerns can often be different from
those the organisation may have anticipated.
Early engagement in the planning process can help to ensure that an organisation deals with local
concerns in a proactive way, instead of needing to react to partial or poor information in later project
stages, which could generate distrust, tensions or delays and extra cost.
Addressing local concerns may allow broader multiple benefits to be explored and incorporated
within the scheme, resulting in better value for money.
Good engagement can enhance the reputation of the engaging organisation as being a body open
and willing to listen, and can help to ensure that any future engagements and projects are potentially
approached with a positive attitude by the community. It also means that the organisation is more
likely to secure positive publicity from the project.
34.3 DEVELOPING AN ENGAGEMENT PLAN
Community engagement should not be undertaken without a well thought out engagement plan and the
right team to implement it from the engaging organisation.
Each engagement plan will be different and will be dependent on the sie and complexity of the project
(Section 34.3.1) who will be engaged (Section 34.3.2) and the resources available to the engaging
organisation (Section 34.3.4).
Definin hat needs to be done
The reasons for engaging with the local community will vary from one project or site to another. There
should be clarity and agreement within the project team from the beginning regarding what the community
engagement exercise is expected to deliver and what would be deemed a success (Section 34.3.3).
If the purpose of the engagement process is clear to the project team, there is a better chance that it
can also be made clear to the community so it is important that there is clarity regarding roles within the
engagement process within both the project team and the community (Setions an ).
The engagement process should focus on delivering an overall aim (eg we want to reduce flood risk for
the local community) rather than specific outcomes (eg we want to build 20 rain gardens). Care should
be taken to ensure that the community does not feel that specific outcomes have been predetermined.
Therefore, where the engagement seeks to enable the community to influence design decisions, it
Chapter 34: Community engagement
719
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
should be clear about which aspects of the design are flexible and which are fixed. There is little point
in engaging if there is no flexibility in the outcome and the design team needs to open to allowing
engagement to shape the outcome.
The type and scale of engagement needed will vary depending on the sie of project (ie how large a
community will it affect) and complexity (eg how unusual is the scheme being proposed or how complex
are the problems being addressed). A small infill development will not need significant community
engagement. A large urban regeneration project that will be looking to maximise the opportunities to
retrofit SuDS may require a relatively large community engagement exercise with multiple stages and
involving as much of the community as possible. Where a wide range of organisations or groups are
invited to participate, they should each be encouraged to present a single view wherever possible, rather
than presenting the views of individuals.
The engagement needed will also vary during different stages of the SuDS design process (Chapter 7).
Where the engagement is taking place during the early stages of the design process, it is usually beneficial
to have a wide range of participants to ensure that a wide range of opinions are considered. Where
engagement is taking place during the later stages of the design process, it may be more appropriate to
have more focused groups of participants to look at specific issues.
Flexibility is an important requirement to factor into the engagement plan. The outcome of engaging
with the public can never be fully predicted. Further stages may be required if unexpected issues arise.
Alternative forms of engagement may be required if one form of engagement is not as successful as
anticipated (Section 34.4.3).
For large projects, it can be useful to plan the engagement process with the assistance of the community
(ie the first engagement stage is to plan the other stages).
Once the purpose of the engagement has been agreed and the type(s) of engagement have been
considered (Section 34.1), then the plan for delivery should reflect that focus throughout, including
being clear about the role of the community
involving the community in appropriate ways that are meaningful
clarifying the extent to which people can influence decisions
explaining the stages, and at which stage different decisions will be made
managing expectations over the outcome by being realistic about what can be achieved.
Being realistic is particularly important, otherwise the process can lose credibility if the expected
outcomes are not met.
The scope of the engagement exercise should be defined in terms of the engagement stages, how they
are delivered, the resources available to deliver them, and the timescale within which an outcome needs
to be delivered. Section 34.4 provides guidance on delivering engagement.
dentifin ho needs to be inoed
To get the most value from community engagement, the first step is to understand who is part of the
community. This process of stakeholder analysis can potentially cover a wide range of individuals and
organisations coming from a range of sectors, such as
public and private sector organisations, local trusts or voluntary bodies and environmental,
conservation or community organisations
utility companies and service providers in the area, such as the water company, highways authority
and local trash/recycling companies
all potentially affected landowners
720 Part E: Supporting guidance
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
those who have a role in local decision making or regulation, such as the planning authority, the
environmental regulator or the internal drainage board
those who live or work within a specific geographic area, such as those who may live within an area
with a known flood risk, including both those who are likely to be affected and those who think they
may be
those who may have the ability to affect the project in their own right, or who are known to be in favour
of, or against the project (such as members of parliament, local councillors and community leaders).
Consideration in defining who to engage with can usefully be undertaken through the community itself, as
in many instances it can be better placed to help identify the broadest range of stakeholders. Care should
also be taken to ensure that those engaged include the widest range of people in terms of diversity,
including age, gender, ethnicity, vulnerability and disability. Some sections of the community may be less
vocal than others and a suitable means for them to provide their views should be considered.
If an engagement event needs to be focused on a specific issue, it may be appropriate to target specific
organisations and individuals to participate. This can be important at critical stages of the engagement
process to ensure its effectiveness. Should this be necessary, there may be a need to follow this up with
more inclusive events to retain collective ownership within the community.
A database that can be cross-referenced for people and organisations or other associations should be
set up early in the process. Any database must be set up having fully understood the requirements of
the Data Protection Act 199. This database should have details of who has been contacted, who then
engaged in the process, when and how. This provides a very useful tool for ensuring that people remain
engaged (as appropriate) and can be used for evaluating effectiveness (Section 34.4.3).
Individuals or groups should be given the opportunity to decide how they want to be involved whether directly
or through their group, and whether they wish to be active or to just receive information about the project.
Other issues that should inform how the engagement is handled with the stakeholders/community
could include
discovering how previous engagements with this community may have been handled, and their
degree of success, while not assuming that this project will be the same
understanding what else is happening within both the community and local community groups
to ensure that there is no confusion between the project and any other activities locally, and
whether there are any potential synergies with such activities (eg are there any opportunities to
share a platform)
working with existing local partnerships to access particular sectors of the community they may also
be able to assist with developing the engagement plan
ensuring that those most vocal are involved, but not allowed to dominate
ensuring that any engaged group is properly representative
deciding how to include people at various stages if they become interested later in the process
considering how to work with other decision-makers or regulators and at what stage in the process
an early discussion around this is likely to be helpful.
34.3.3 Encouraging participation
The level of participation (ie the degree to which committees, groups or individuals are actively involved in
formulating a specific project or outcome) needs to be carefully considered.
Generally, where the level of participation is high, with people learning and making decisions together,
the level of ownership of those decisions is also likely to be higher and, consequently, the project is likely
to be more successful. Also, the greater the involvement of the public within the engagement, the greater
their impact can be on the outcome.
Chapter 34: Community engagement
721
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
However, a high level of participation brings with it responsibilities. It is important to avoid promising or
implying a level of participation or decision making that is not intended or not achievable. Processes that
claim to be empowering but merely offer token levels of participation should be avoided, as this can
undermine the engagement process.
ain the riht enain team
Good leadership that is consistent throughout the project is essential, to ensure that a consistent clear
message is given and that the public know who to contact.
Project/engagement team members may come from within an organisation, or they may be external,
depending on the skills required. There are organisations that can be brought in to a project team to
undertake detailed engagement with communities.
The composition of the project team may also change throughout the development and implementation
of the engagement plan and should reflect the skills required at each stage. The early stages may
need those with good external relationship skills, whereas the later stages may require those with more
technical expertise (see ase stuy ). Where communities are encouraged to take an active role,
some individuals within the community may need training or assistance to enable them to contribute fully,
as it is important to have individuals who are good listeners and communicators.
Those involved in the project will need a range of experience and skills, which could include local
knowledge, familiarity with community engagement processes or existing relationships with the
community or other stakeholders. Consideration should also be given to the level of diversity within the
team and how that may reflect the community (and whether it needs to).
34.3.5 Managing risks
There is always a risk when undertaking community engagement that it may not achieve an acceptable
outcome for the organisation, or that the community does not engage in a way that allows the process
to be effective. Identifying the key individuals in the community or finding a local champion can help to
reduce this risk this is usually effective and is good practice.
Should any conflicts or problems arise as part of the engagement process, this should be addressed
openly and in a timely way to reduce the risk of it damaging either community relations or the outcome
of the process. As part of this process, a time frame or deadline should be agreed to respond to any
concerns raised.
Risks are best managed by having a monitoring/evaluation process in place during the engagement
process (Section 34.4.3).
34.4 DELIVERING ENGAGEMENT
A wide range of methods or tools are available to support the engagement process. Those selected will
be dependent on the desired outcome at each stage in the process. Early in the engagement process
methods and tools selected may be more general, whereas at a later stage discussion and information
will be needed in much greater detail and much more focused, to support the evolution of the process.
ommuniatin effetie
Communicating effectively with the community is a key part of the engagement process. Communication
can be one way (providing information) or two way (involving discussion, problem-solving etc).
When providing information to a community about a project, it is essential to know who the information is
for, how they are most likely to access it and what is the best way to ensure understanding.
722 Part E: Supporting guidance
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
At every stage all information should be
high quality
consistent in the message it is communicating
appropriate to the specific stage of engagement
timely, ie provided at the right time in the project
targeted towards the people who will receive it
clear, interesting and easily understood by those receiving it
explicit about whether a response is required and, if so, how to do so
clear about the contact details for further information.
As individuals access information differently, it may be necessary to provide it in several different
formats, such as on a website, through an exhibition or by a paper distribution. Information should
also acknowledge local cultural and social needs including language, times of availability and local
religious or cultural events such as festivals, which could prevent participation. Practical approaches
that demonstrate how a scheme may work or look (using models, marking it out on the ground or using
a mock-up) can be highly effective, particularly for the many people who are not familiar with interpreting
two-dimensional plans and elevations. The use of clear and concise case studies of similar projects can
also be very useful to show that successful outcomes can be achieved and what they look like.
Transparency in all communications is vital. Issues that are currently adversely affecting members of
the community, such as flooding, or could adversely affect the community as a result of the project,
such as access or parking for vehicles, and health and safety concerns regarding open water, should be
treated with sensitivity. This will then encourage trust and a co-operative working relationship. Access
to statistical information regarding specific concerns, such as parking, is particularly helpful to enable
discussions to be based on facts rather than speculation or perception. This information can then also be
used to help measure the subsequent success of the project.
The techniques for communications are extremely varied, and will include both meetings and other
events, as well as the provision of information (either by the engaging organisation or by the community).
Examples include
eetins and other eents
open house sessions
public meetings
workshops/design charrette1
site visits
smaller focus groups
one-to-one sessions
surveys/questionnaires
interviews.

Guidance on a wide range of techniques for communication and engagement is provided in Daly et al (2015b).
Ensuring that information about the project and events reaches the target audience is fundamental to its
success, so using local channels of communication, particularly through community groups, can be very
effective. Consideration should also be given to the need to provide information/translation into different
languages. The timing and location of events or meetings should be arranged to make them accessible
by the widest range of people, and should ideally be local to the project and include options for meeting/
attending outside working hours or at weekends.
The quality and abilities of individual facilitators at public meetings is also crucial in delivering effective
outcomes. They should understand and be able to use a range of techniques which encourage attendees
to overcome barriers, whether real or perceived, so they can participate effectively.
Where responses are requested through a questionnaire or interview, such information should be dealt
with appropriately and sensitively, also bearing in mind the provisions of the Data Protection Act 199.
uestionnaires should be carefully constructed to ensure that the questions are clear, simple and
unambiguous, do not lead the respondent to specific answers, are relatively short in length and state
clearly that the replies will be kept anonymous.
aintainin enaement and eduation
Once the engagement process has been started, regular reporting both within the engaging organisation
and to the community will be important to maintain trust and to keep channels of communication open
and effective. All engagement activities should have a follow-up step, where the outcomes are shared
and progress is reported.
Where groups have been set up for collaborative engagement, these will require management to maintain
their interest, commitment and enthusiasm.
Where groups have been empowered to act independently within agreed guidelines, these will also
need ongoing liaison to ensure that they adhere to their stated intention and purpose, and that they are
prepared to continue with the projects they have taken on.
Community engagement for all SuDS projects should include making the public aware of the wider
objectives of sustainable water management and the reasons why the SuDS scheme is important
and needs to be maintained throughout its lifetime (in some cases with their involvement). Methods of
providing a long-term educational resource or reminders should be considered. Working with schools
or community groups can be effective in this respect, as children are a useful conduit for educating their
parents and securing their involvement.

Evaluating the effectiveness of a community engagement process is important, as lessons can then
be used to inform future engagement processes and help to manage risks (Section 34.3.5). The
engagement process should be monitored and evaluated during the process, not just afterwards, so that
the process can be adapted as necessary.
Useful questions to consider include the following
Were the original objectives achieved or not, and why
How effective were the methods used
What information/events did you use
What proportion of the community did you reach
Did it represent all aspects effectively
What would you do differently another time
What did the participants think of the engagement process
Was it worthwhile for them
How much time and money did the process take more/less than anticipated
Is the communication process still continuing
Did the process deliver a recognisable benefit

Upton Meadows, to the north-west of Northampton, is a sustainable urban extension, and will provide
1200 new homes on 10 ha of land, once completed. SuDS were incorporated in the master plan and
design code in 2001, with stakeholder and community engagement playing a key part in decision
making. The design team from the Prince’s Foundation for Building Community led an Enquiry
by Design (EbD) process and facilitated a dialogue with all local key stakeholders, government
organisations and agencies, enabling the outcomes of the EbD to influence the final design code for
its development. The need to mitigate any additional flood risk arising from the development of Upton
Meadows was a major issue locally, particularly after the severe flooding downstream in Northampton
during Easter 199.

biodiversity gains over time. Since 200, environmental and social impacts of the site have been
studied, and in 2012 the Prince’s Foundation for Building Community, working with the University of
Northampton, set up a research project to understand how to engage the community with the natural
capital (the SuDS and green spaces) within Upton. The project explored
the level of appreciation of residents of the urban design features within the development,
including the SuDS
whether the residents valued the green spaces and used them
whether residents connected the green spaces and natural capital at Upton to their own health
and wellbeing
the level of awareness among residents of how the SuDS at Upton work, and how these systems
contribute to the natural capital within their residential development.
Stae uestionnaire
A questionnaire was delivered to over 170 homes over a 2-month period, with 5 households returning
them ( completion rate). The questionnaire was split into five sections, one of which dealt
specifically with attitudes around SuDS. Responses related to green space generally, which includes
SuDS were:
77 of the residents thought the green spaces around the development were important
91. of the residents said they actually go out and enjoy the surrounding green space at Upton
Meadows
1 of residents believed that the green space makes Upton a healthier place to live
7 thought that their quality of life had improved.
Specific responses related to the SuDS were
over 5 of residents stated that they believed they knew how their drainage systems work,
yet only said that they were given any formal information on SuDS before moving into their
properties
felt that the swales and ponds could be a health risk
69 of residents enjoyed seeing dragonflies there
also liked the idea that frogs and newts were found in the swales and ponds
only 7 of respondents feared that blockages would cause flooding.
There was a highly positive correlation that indicated that the same residents who thought the water made
the development more attractive also did not mind the swales, and 29 of residents perceived that their
property value has increased due to the design of the swales and ponds surrounding Upton Meadows.
These responses informed how the following activities were developed.

The aims of the STEM event were to raise awareness with the school children regarding
how our urban landscapes can cause surface water flooding
what SuDS are and how they work
how SuDS can alleviate additional risk of flooding from urban landscapes.
The lesson plan was designed to help the children develop a better understanding of how the water
cycle (which they had previously studied) could be linked to flooding in urban developments. It also
incorporated how flood risk could be mitigated using SuDS, alongside the biodiversity and green
space benefits. The model allowed them to relate the exercise directly to Upton.
The SuDS model was the central focus for the STEM activity, and after the event, the school also
used it to engage other children within the school. The model actively demonstrated how water flowed
around the buildings and within the landscape, and how parts of the model would flood when it rained
(simulated using spray arms). The engineering issues and how SuDS work were then explained, and
the children were invited to retrofit the model with more sustainable options to prevent flooding. Green
sponges were used to replicate porous surfaces such as grass and green roofs (iures an
34.2). Each session was 5 minutes with a group of 1015 children, repeated throughout the day, and
with a group of teachers at the end (iure ).
The STEM activity day developed a legacy of learning at the school, that is being built into the primary
school curriculum for future children who will grow up in the Upton area.

Priors Farm is a housing estate of just over 00 homes on the edge of Cheltenham, which suffers
from surface water flooding (pluvial flooding), as well as surcharging of its combined sewers (sewer
flooding), with consequential downstream flooding of the adjacent estate. The surface water flooding
is caused by runoff from the adjacent hill.
The Environment Agency (EA) set up the project under their Gloucestershire Green Urban Rivers
Project, to develop and implement measures to improve the ecological quality of rivers or water
bodies as required by the Water Framework Directive (WFD), which have been affected by sewage
discharges. This site was selected as a demonstration SuDS retrofit site within Cheltenham Borough,
and sought to engage both the council, their social housing providers, Cheltenham Borough Homes
and the Guinness Partnership as partners and supporters in the project, alongside potential input or
assistance from the Highways Authority and Severn Trent Water.
This project was always seen as the first phase. Future phases are due to be implemented by the
borough council in partnership with Gloucestershire County Council and Cheltenham Borough Homes.
This will include a further area of public open space, more rain gardens and a surface water planter in
one of the roads.

The aspiration for the project was also to inform and promote the delivery of retrofitted SuDS by third parties
into the future. It was also hoped that the outputs would inform the green infrastructure plan for the borough.
The stages of engagement for the project are summarised below.
Stae Initial enaement y te
Initial engagement was undertaken by the EA to explain the problem, generate interest and
involvement in the project within the estate and to canvass opinion on possible solutions. These were
undertaken in three parts
1 Letter drop to all houses on the estate, explaining the problem and inviting all residents to a public
exhibition ( iures an ).
2 Public exhibition held on a weekend in an open marquee within the site, with exhibition boards
explaining the localised flooding issues and the ways in which it could be addressed. Members of
the EA were on hand to answer questions and explain the project further. The exhibition included a
qui for children to undertake, related to information on the exhibition boards.
Residents were asked to provide their contact details if they would consider being part of the
project, and to provide feedback on the alternative ideas presented.
After this initial engagement, a preliminary concept was developed and the EA tendered and
appointed a landscape architect and engineer. The proposals considered the potential of all areas
of open space within the estate and evaluated every front garden for the potential inclusion of a rain
garden. Three separate areas of public open space were considered suitable, along with around 0
of the front gardens (115 no.), and concept plans produced.

The landscape architects then met the individual owners to explain the options for the rain gardens
and to agree how theirs would be integrated and planted.
This involved one-to-one meetings with individual residents. Leaflets illustrated the options available for
designs and shapes for the rain gardens, with images to explain their look and feel (iure ). Residents
were asked to select the design they preferred, and to discuss how it would be sited on their property, and the
way in which the water would be conveyed to the rain garden from the disconnected downpipe.
Leaflets offering optional colour schemes for the plants were given to those residents who had
committed to a rain garden, allowing them to select the individual plant species for their rain garden
within a given range of parameters (iure ).
During construction, residents were involved in agreeing how existing plants would be lifted and
replanted (where relevant) to make space for the rain garden, any specific details regarding the route
of the channel to the rain garden, and how the actual plants would be set out within it.

Further steps were taken to provide a legacy of the engagement, in order to
ensure that individual rain gardens are identified as drainage features
maintain awareness that the redesign of the public open space creates a drainage feature which
has environmental benefits

costs and benefits of SuS schemes and how these can be compared

Reference is made to several other publications that provide further guidance and
tools in Sections and
35.1 INTRODUCTION
Wh assess osts and benefits?
SuDS can deliver multiple benefits (Chapter 1), and the overarching principle of SuDS
design is that surface water runoff should be managed to maximise these benefits
(Chapter 2). Achieving this is dependent on good design, good engagement and good
decision making.
A vital part of good decision making is the ability to understand both the costs and
the benefits associated with the decision being made. This needs to be based on the
best evidence available, bearing in mind that the information will never be complete or
perfect. Recognising and dealing with uncertainty has always been an intrinsic part of
decision making.
Costs, to a larger extent, are relatively straightforward to quantify, but benefits
are generally not so easy. However, comparing costs and benefits can prove very
worthwhile. For example, although the cost of implementing a SuDS scheme will
generally be borne by the developer, in some scenarios it could be shared by other
partners where they will benefit, eg a sewerage undertaker, local authority or other
interested party.
Many stakeholders can potentially benefit from a SuDS scheme, especially if
opportunities are identified at feasibility stage and appropriate engagement is
undertaken. As the benefits of SuDS are now better understood, partnerships for
delivering schemes are becoming more common. Partnerships have the advantages
that there may be (a) more than one source of capital funding and (b) a shared
responsibility for long-term costs. Potential partners will want to know how and why
they should help with funding and what the benefits will be for them. Details of potential
beneficiaries and types of potential funding groups are provided in Digman et al (2015).

the Council with the water company’s funding cycle for AMP5, with successful delivery by March 2015.
The scheme has a 100-year design life and provides protection from surface water and sewer flooding
for 175 and 10 year events respectively. Overall, 7 properties have a reduced risk of surface
water flooding and 0 properties have a reduced risk of sewer flooding.
The direct economic benefits were valued following guidance provided in EA (201). These were
conservatively valued at around 12.0 m. The SuDS have provided a 2750 m2 wetland and some
500 m2 of new wildflower meadows. There is also a series of new earth bunds that detain, divert
and direct flows to storage of 7,000 m3 on the surface with a further 000 m3 in three underground
geocellular tanks.
Extensive stakeholder engagement with local residents, businesses and community interest groups
was integral to the success of the scheme and ensured a legacy of amenity and environmental
benefits for the local community as well as signposting a way forward for future approaches to
reducing the risk of surface water flooding in urban areas.

What an be assessed?
Costs are estimated in order to understand one or more of the following:
the likely capital cost of a proposed scheme
the likely operation and maintenance costs of a proposed scheme – annually or over the design life
of the scheme
the total cost of a proposed scheme over its lifetime (ie whole-life cost)
how different elements of the proposed scheme might contribute towards the capital or maintenance
costs and, therefore, how costs might be optimised (eg looking at options that reduce long-term
maintenance costs)
where and when costs might accrue to different stakeholders
how costs of alternative SuDS schemes compare with one another or compare to a conventional
piped drainage scheme
how costs might best be reduced.
In order to understand the return on the investment of a scheme (ie how much benefit is gained from the
cost incurred), it is also necessary to assess the benefits.
In general terms, benefits can be assessed in order to understand
the type and scale of benefits of a proposed scheme
where and when benefits might accrue to different stakeholders
how different elements of the proposed scheme contribute towards the delivery of the overall
benefits of the scheme and therefore how benefits might best be maximised or optimised
how benefits of alternative SuDS schemes compare with one another or compare to a conventional
piped drainage scheme.
When both the costs and benefits are assessed together, this enables the SuDS design to be optimised
(ie to manage, treat and make best use of surface water in order to maximise benefits at reasonable cost)
and should form part of the option appraisal process.
Where a comparison is being made between alternative SuDS options or a SuDS scheme is being
compared with a below-ground piped drainage system, it is important to ensure that like is being
compared with like. For example, either the water quantity and water quality performance of each option
has to be identical or the benefits that can be attributed to that performance (such as improved water
quality or reduced flood risk) need to be estimated separately for each option.
When shoud an assessment be arried out?
The usefulness and effectiveness of assessing costs and benefits is greatest when it forms part of an early
stage of the design process (Chapter 7), so that scheme viability and affordability can be addressed up
front. Once the main planning and design decisions have been made for a site, the type of options (decision
alternatives) that can be assessed and compared become more limited.
Project partners, clients or funders and other key stakeholders should agree on whether such an
assessment is required, why, when and to what level of detail (Section 35.1.4), as schemes are usually
defined and designed to meet specific objectives (local or national standards, local planning objectives etc).
o an osts and benefits be assessed?
The level of detail appropriate for an assessment will depend greatly on the drivers for the assessment,
the scale of the scheme, the extent of the likely benefits that can be realised and what stage of the design
process has been reached.
Chapter 5 Costs and benefits
737
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Both costs and benefits are highly context specific and will vary significantly (in monetary terms) depending
on the site characteristics, the use(s) of the site and the specific composition of the SuDS scheme.
It is important for any assessment to be robust, transparent and open to scrutiny. This will lead to
increased buy-in from stakeholders and more opportunities for shared funding.
The remainder of this chapter provides an overview of key concepts in estimating costs and benefits
(Section 35.2). Then the chapter summarises best practice for estimating costs (Section 35.3)
and assessing benefits (Section 35.4), and subsequently how costs and benefits can be compared
(Section 35.5).
This chapter does not provide unit costs or benefit values. Several of the publications listed in this chapter
do provide unit costs and/or benefits, but these should be used with caution. These sources of information
are often based on studies carried out more than ten years ago or are based on a limited number of case
studies, so are likely to be subject to high levels of uncertainty. If using this information, checks are needed
to ensure that inflation is accounted for, that the case studies used to generate the unit costs/benefits are
representative of the characteristics of the site to be assessed and that there are no specific features of
the scheme that are likely to have a significant impact on the cost/benefit. For example, whether or not an
impermeable liner is required beneath a detention basin will have a significant impact on cost whether or
not the permanent pond volume (in addition to the attenuation storage volume) is included as part of the
volume calculations for a pond component will also have a significant impact on cost.
Defra (2007) and HM Treasury (2011) provide a number of supporting documents for how to assess costs
and benefits under the Green Book series. Publications on benefit transfer methods, and the limitations
of doing this, are particularly relevant, because SuDS benefits are frequently determined based on
transference from seemingly equivalent or comparable schemes. Digman et al (2015) provides guidance
on how to do this.
There are a number of other publications that provide guidance on estimating costs and benefits relevant
for SuDS. These are listed in Section 35.3.10.
35.2 KEY CONCEPTS FOR ASSESSING COSTS AND BENEFITS
Whoeife auation
If whole-life costs and benefits are considered early enough in the development of a scheme (ie at the
feasibility stage), this can have a number of advantages. By having an improved understanding of long-
term investment requirements (rather than just capital costs), it is also possible to secure
more robust decision-making at option appraisal stage
improved assessment of long-term risks to SuDS scheme performance and inclusion of monitoring
and management plans to minimise these risks
reduced uncertainty associated with adoption agreements and commuted sum contributions.
Whole-life costing (sometimes referred to as life-cycle costing) considers the total cost of a scheme over
its lifetime. Figure 35.4 shows a conceptual schematic of a potential cost profile for a SuDS scheme.
This not only covers feasibility studies, site investigation, design and construction, but also includes
operation, maintenance, adaptation and (depending on the planning conditions for the site) disposal and
decommissioning activities.
7 Part E: Supporting guidance
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Figure 5. An example SuDS expenditure profile
One of the challenges of whole-life costing is determining what the lifetime of the scheme will be. The
primary purpose of expenditure on a SuDS scheme beyond the construction stage is to maintain the
system’s performance for its lifetime. Although a scheme may have a specific design life (sometimes
referred to as expected effective service life), in reality the life expectancy (or actual service life) for
a scheme alters constantly, depending on a number of factors including the maintenance activities
(Section 35.3.3) that are (or are not) undertaken and any changes in function of the site. With the growing
understanding about future changes in climate, and urban design and planning, the required performance
of the scheme may also change over its lifetime. Hence, the flexibility to allow change is also an important
consideration in scheme selection.
In the same way that costs accrue throughout the lifetime of a SuDS scheme, benefits can also accrue
over time that is, not all benefits may be realised immediately following construction. Therefore, any
assessment of benefits also needs to adopt a whole-life evaluation approach. Consistent approaches for
both benefits and costs then allow fair comparisons, where this is required. Discounting is described in
Section 35.2.2.
35.2.2 Discounting
Discounting is the approach used to determine the present day value of future costs to be spent and/
or benefits that are predicted to accrue over time. By discounting predicted costs and benefits over the
lifetime of a scheme, they can be more appropriately compared. As the value of money changes over
time, the value of a cost or benefit in the future may not be representative of its actual worth in present
terms. Therefore, a standard accounting technique is to calculate a present value (PV). This results in a
cost or benefit that occurs in the future being given a lower value than if it occurred now (Equation 35.1).
Where there are multiple costs and benefits occurring over multiple years for a scheme, by summing of
all of the individual PVs for each cost or benefit for each year, it is possible to determine the net present
value (NPV) for the scheme as a whole (Equation 35.1).
When assessing whole-life costs and benefits, it is advisable to use PVs, but selection of the most
appropriate discount rate is very important, as it has a significant effect on the outcome of the analysis.
Chapter 5 Costs and benefits
739
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Calculations using a high discount rate will make future costs less important, while a lower discount rate
will reduce the impact of early capital costs on the whole-life cost.
The discount rate should be agreed with the relevant parties in advance.
In the UK, HM Treasury (2011) recommends a discount rate of .5. For schemes with a lifetime of over
0 years, the Treasury recommends that a declining schedule of rates is used rather than the standard
discount rate. The rationale for this comes from uncertainty in the more distant future.
Further guidance on using NPV is provided in Section 35.5.1.
Commuted sums that are paid by a developer to local authorities for the adoption of SuDS are usually
limited to a 25 year period, but can be longer, so the standard discount rate can be applied. However,
costlier rehabilitation works that may be required beyond the first 25 years should consider a longer
discount period.

nertaint and sensitiit anasis
When assessing costs or benefits, it is important to be aware of the uncertainty associated with estimates
and to carry out sensitivity analysis where necessary.
There are many sources of potential uncertainty when estimating costs and benefits, although generally
these are not specific to SuDS. The sources are very diverse, ranging from the discount rate used to
the application of unit costs to the receiving water quality and the future climate. Potential sources of
uncertainty when assessing benefits are described in Digman et al (2015).
The scale of uncertainty will vary depending on the source data and the method used for the estimation,
but it will not always be known. The significance for decision making of the uncertainty related to costs
and benefits depends on the characteristics of the site and the proposed scheme.
By undertaking sensitivity analysis it will become apparent which valuations have the greatest effect on
determining the most cost-beneficial option and therefore where allowances need to be made to account
for uncertainty or, in cases of extreme uncertainty, where that uncertainty needs to be reduced.

In its simplest form, sensitivity analysis can consist of using different values from those used in the initial
assessment and seeing what affect this has on the outcome. However, if there are a lot of parameters,
sensitivity analysis by varying each parameter in turn can be time consuming. In such circumstances, it
is worthwhile looking at available tools for economic appraisal that provide a degree of automation to the
process, such as from Digman et al (2015).
Sensitivity analysis can also be applied to assessments that do not result in quantification. For example,
where stakeholders are involved in a qualitative assessment, they are likely to have different views of
what is most important and score benefits differently. Sensitivity analysis can help to determine whether
these differences would affect the final decision. Often they do not, and so sensitivity analysis can help to
resolve any disagreements between interested parties (Maxwell et al, 2011).
Further guidance on dealing with uncertainty and sensitivity testing can be found in HM Treasury (2011),
Shamier (201), DCLG (2009) and Maxwell et al (2011), among others.
35.3 ESTIMATING COSTS
35.3.1 Feasibility, appraisal and design costs
Feasibility, appraisal and preliminary design costs can sometimes be greater for SuDS schemes than
for below-ground piped drainage systems, as there are more issues to be considered. However, some of
these costs may be attributed to landscape and building design. Good SuDS design should look at how
to maximise the various benefits offered by SuDS, which may require the appraisal of a range of options.
Further details on the planning and design process are provided in Chapter 7.
The cost of the land within a site required for the SuDS scheme (known as land-take) can be one of
the most significant factors influencing the cost of implementing a SuDS scheme and therefore should
be considered as early as possible. With good design of multi-functional space, the effective cost of the
land for a scheme can be minimal, for example where the site has multiple uses such as a car park or
recreational area, or where the scheme forms part of a required public open space area. However, in
high-density settings the value of land can far outweigh construction costs and the land-take associated
with specific SuDS components may determine the selection of drainage options. Whether or not the cost
of land should be included within a whole-life cost assessment will depend on whether the use of the land
is dedicated to SuDS alone whether the land can serve multiple functions (because of using SuDS) or
whether the land would otherwise be developable if not used for SuDS, that is its value could be realised
in another way (Section 35.3.8).
35.3.2 Construction costs
Construction costs to be considered in any costing process should include:
material costs
land costs
construction (labour and equipment costs)
planting and landscaping costs
erosion and sediment control of the SuDS during construction and any subsequent rehabilitation
relocation of existing utility assets (if required generally only for retrofit schemes).
The cost of constructing a SuDS scheme will depend primarily on the sie of the contributing catchment
area, but will also be influenced by
soil type (eg excavation costs are likely to be significantly higher in rocky soils infiltration
opportunities will vary)
Chapter 5 Costs and benefits
741
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
groundwater vulnerability (eg sensitive groundwater ones may require impermeable geomembrane
liners to be included within the design)
design criteria (these will determine component sies and the extent of Management Train needed)
design features (eg heavily planted ponds can be more expensive than ponds left to colonise naturally)
access and space requirements
location (eg material and labour costs vary regionally, and local rainfall characteristics will affect siing)
inlet and outlet hydraulic control characteristics
any off-site works required for exceedance flow management.
In general, the total volume or area of a SuDS component is likely to be a strong predictor of cost.
However, there are economies of scale associated with construction, due to costs of inlet and outlet
structures, and mobilisation of equipment that are relatively similar regardless of component size.
As with any drainage scheme, consideration should also be given to the impacts of the scheme during the
construction period on the site and the surrounding area (whether these can be monetised or not), such
as noise, disruption or inconvenience to residents and others.
Guidance on construction of individual SuDS components is provided in Chapters 11–23. Guidance on
construction good practice is provided in Chapter 31.
When employing a quantity surveyor, it can be helpful to discuss with them how costs for the SuDS
components can be determined separately from other external works. For example, there will be a need
to differentiate between generic soft landscape works and those that are part of the drainage system
works. This will enable correct costing, billing and allocation of maintenance resources.
eration and maintenane osts
Although the greatest part of the total cost for a scheme is usually the capital cost, SuDS schemes also
require a finance stream to cover long-term operation and maintenance costs (as does a below-ground
piped system). An estimate has to be made regarding what these costs are likely to be, and funding
requirements need to be agreed by the parties involved.
As many SuDS schemes utilise natural planting and are designed to support ecosystems and biodiversity,
there needs to be a period of intensive maintenance of the emerging vegetation to ensure that it grows
and provides the expected service. This will usually require specialist horticultural expertise and will incur
costs beyond the construction phase. It is recommended that this is included in the construction contract
and is the responsibility of the contractor (Chapter 29). Where the SuDS have more than one use, such
as for recreation, there may also be a period of initial setting up and commissioning of the recreational
area that will incur costs, although these costs would be expected to accrue to the operators of the
recreational facilities rather than the developer.
SuDS schemes then require maintenance, in order to ensure short-term operation and minimise risks to
long-term performance.
Operation and maintenance activities can be classified as follows
inspection and reporting (eg regular visits which are generally undertaken at the same time as
regular maintenance this may also include monitoring at larger sites, if required)
regular maintenance (eg clearing inlets and outlets, collecting trash and debris, grass-cutting,
vegetation management, brushing of permeable surfaces, emptying of silt traps)
occasional maintenance (eg responding to problems such as blocked culverts or trash racks,
pollution incidents, vegetation death, structural damage, responding and clean-up after
extreme events)
72 Part E: Supporting guidance
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
remedial maintenance (eg for major during-life refurbishment such as geotextile replacement,
vegetation replacement, soakaway replacement, major sediment removal activities)
adaptation actions (eg responding to changes in drainage requirements for the site, especially if the
life of the SuDS scheme is to be extended, although this can only be costed if planned).
Operation and maintenance costs will normally comprise
labour and equipment costs
material and/or replacement product costs
replacement and/or extra planting costs
disposal costs of, for example, contaminated sediments and vegetation (Chapter 33).
Where pollution prevention strategies such as street sweeping and public education programmes are
included as part of a SuDS scheme (Chapter 27), these costs should be included as an continuing
operation cost.
The cost of operation and maintenance activities can vary substantially, depending on
location (this will influence material, labour and equipment charges)
ease of access (confined sites can be much more expensive to maintain due to requirements for
specialist equipment)
upstream activities (in particular, any ongoing development, as this will influence the rate of sediment
accumulation in the system)
use of the SuDS (where it is multi-functional, such as an additional amenity or ecological function,
specific maintenance may be required to ensure that functionality is maintained, but these costs may
be shared between various partners, such as the local authority or volunteer community groups)
quality of on-site construction or off-site manufacture of products
the need for off-site disposal of waste
the effectiveness of the design of the scheme to mitigate the above costs.
Guidance on designing for maintenance for individual SuDS components is provided in Chapters 11–23.
Guidance on maintenance good practice is provided in Chapter 32.
Where SuDS are part of or provide multiple functions, there may be important social considerations
and risks associated with their normal functioning. Where, for example, a SuDS component provides a
storage area for exceedance flows that functions infrequently and is also used for other purposes, such
as recreation, there may be a number of additional costs to consider, such as:
provision of permanent signage to warn of infrequent inundation of the area
educating the local community of the function of the SuDS component and encouraging local
ownership and appropriate use
warning the local population when inundation is imminent and erection of temporary warning signs
or barriers
policing the area when the area is inundated, to ensure public safety
where the design does not provide for it, pumping out and restoration of the temporarily inundated
area, including verifying that the ground does not present a health risk
engagement with local communities before, during and after an inundation event.
Reference should be made to best practice in designing and managing for exceedance as defined
in Digman et al (2006) and Digman et al (201) and to ISO 10002009 for risk assessment and
Chapter 5 Costs and benefits
743
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
management. These costs will vary depending on local circumstances and the particular use of the land,
which may or may not be multi-functional.
35.3.4 Monitoring costs
For large or high risk schemes, the environmental regulator may require a long-term monitoring regime
as a condition of planning. At such sites, the capital and ongoing costs for monitoring also need to be
included in the economic evaluation.
Disosa and deommissionin
At the end of its design life, it is likely that a SuDS scheme would either be:
a) fully rehabilitated, in which case the cost would be borne by the drainage owner or adoption body, or
b) redeveloped, in which case the disposal and decommissioning costs would be accepted by the
next developer.
Such costs will generally be small, due to the landscaped nature of most SuDS schemes and the lack of
significant hard infrastructure.
esidua aue
In a full economic evaluation, the residual value of the drainage system should be included in the
analysis. The land occupied by the system could theoretically have residual or reclaim value, if the
function of the drainage system is no longer required at the end of the design life. However, in reality, the
following factors mean that it is more appropriate to assume this value to be low or zero:
1 The land areas are too small and distributed to be of value for alternative use.
2 The land is part of public open space required by planning conditions.
There is a high likelihood that the space will be required to fulfil a drainage function after the
allocated design life.
osts aoided
When the proposed drainage scheme prevents a future cost, this is called an avoided cost (if it is
reasonably certain that the cost would have appeared otherwise).
Costs avoided can be a useful means of comparing a SuDS scheme with either an alternative SuDS
scheme or with a below-ground piped drainage system. In order to do this, it is important to ensure that
like is being compared with like. For example, the total cost of a SuDS scheme should not be compared
with only the capital and operational costs of the below-ground piped drainage system, as invariably the
SuDS scheme provides much more than just the drainage for the site. The hard and soft landscaping
and additional functions provided by the SuDS scheme (such as recreational space or overlying car park)
should be compared with the equivalent for the site should a below-ground piped drainage system be
used instead. This will identify any costs avoided due to the multi-functionality of the SuDS scheme and
the reduced need for kerbing, manholes etc.
35.3.8 Opportunity costs
Opportunity costs can also provide a useful means of comparing alternative drainage schemes, but
again, care needs to be taken to ensure that like is being compared with like.
Unlike the costs avoided discussed in Section 35.3.7 , an opportunity cost is the gain that would be
realised by choosing a different course of action. For example, if land was not being used as part of the
SuDS scheme, what would it be used for instead and what gain would it bring?
744 Part E: Supporting guidance
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
timism bias
Optimism bias is a well-known phenomenon whereby project appraisers tend to be over-optimistic about
the outcomes from the decisions they make.
HM Treasury (201) sets out how to compensate for this bias in the estimation of capital costs.
Depending on the project type, the range of bias varies. This can be accounted for by either (a) applying
a percentage uplift figure to the original cost estimate or (b) identifying the contributory factors that lead to
the bias and reducing these, which in turn justifies the percentage uplift to be reduced.
There is no similar specific guidance in the supplementary guide for dealing with optimism bias when
estimating operation and maintenance costs or benefits. Sensitivity analysis is recommended instead that
enables decision-makers to consider to what extent their decisions would change if the actual cost (or
benefit) was significantly greater or less than estimated. For example, how much can maintenance costs
increase if the option is to remain worthwhile?
Guidance on the application of this approach to the assessment of SuDS schemes (for both costs and
benefits) is provided in Digman et al (2015).
35.3.10 Tools and further guidance
Royal Haskoning (2012) provides a literature review of costs and benefits of SuDS in the UK (including
available case study evidence), a unit cost database (based on sources used in the literature review) and
a review of the cost effectiveness of SuDS.
Guidance by Pittner and Allerton (2009) is supported by a whole life cost and whole life carbon tool
(SCOTSNET, 2010) which can be used to support the SuDS selection process for different sites. The tool
calculates capital and maintenance costs and in turn calculates the whole life cost of the scheme. It can
also calculate whole life carbon.
A simpler, higher level costing tool is available on the UKSuDS website: www.uksuds.com (SuDS
construction and maintenance cost calculator). This provides indicative costs for different types of SuDS
components, but can also be used with site-specific costs input by the user to calculate whole-life costs
for a SuDS scheme.
A number of documents are available that provide further data on costs and guidance on their usage,
including Kellagher et al (201), Gordon-Walker et al (2007), UKWIR (2005) and HR Wallingford (200).
For the most part, these are cited in Royal Haskoning (2012).
There is also a series of Defra case studies looking at comparative costings for surface water sewers and
SuDS. Details can be found on: www.susdrain.org.

35.4 ASSESSING BENEFITS
ale provides examples of the types of benefits that can be attributed to SuDS (in alphabetical
order, not in order of scale). This table is not comprehensive, but presents the most commonly recognised
categories of benefit that can be readily delivered by good SuDS design. See Chapters 3–6 for further
details of how SuDS can deliver these benefits, and Digman et al (2015).
Included in ale is an indication of who is likely to benefit, and an estimation of when these benefits
are likely to be realised. This shows that the local community is always likely to benefit.
The table also gives an indication of when these benefits are likely to be realised. These are only
indicative and will vary significantly depending on the scheme. However, it demonstrates that some
benefits can be realised even before the scheme is complete and the drainage system has been
commissioned, such as property prices and educational opportunities. Many benefits are realised in the
short term, such as flood risk reduction and improved security of water supply, and can benefit a large
number of organisations. Other benefits may not be realised until the medium (510 years) or long term
(10 years) and the scale of benefit may depend on other factors such as how much the climate changes
in the future (Section 35.4.6).
Diret and indiret benefits
Some benefits are a direct consequence of SuDS, such as reduced flood risk (by delivering water quantity
criterion 2, Chapter 3) or improved biodiversity (by delivering biodiversity criteria 1, Chapter 6).
However, the overall benefits of a SuDS scheme are more than simply the direct benefits resulting from
delivering the design criteria. Many benefits are indirect (sometimes referred to as secondary or incidental
benefits) and come about in addition to the main reasons for using SuDS, such as health and wellbeing,
which is a product of improved air quality, thermal comfort, recreation etc.
Climate resilience is a combination of both direct and indirect benefits, as the ability of the SuDS to cope
with more frequent or more severe rainfall is a direct benefit, for example, but improved regulation of air
and building temperatures, improved security of water supply, flood risk reduction etc all contribute to the
improved resilience to the present day and future climate as well as being direct benefits in their own right.
Because of these relationships and the difficulties of distinguishing which aspects of SuDS provide which
benefits, care needs to be taken to avoid double counting of the value of the benefits (Section 35.4.5).
One approach that has particular value when the relationships between direct and indirect benefits
are complex, but potentially significant for determining overall benefit, is to consider impact pathways
(Defra, 2007). An example of an impact pathway is shown in Figure 35.5.
Figure 5.5 Impact pathway for assessing the benefits of flood risk reduction
uantifiabe benefits
Direct and indirect benefits (as described above) should not be confused with those benefits that can or
cannot be quantified.
Some benefits of SuDS are readily quantifiable for example, where flooding is mitigated the reduced
damage can be costed using standardised information, such as Penning-Rowsell et al (201).
Some benefits are not so readily quantified, especially in monetary terms, but this does not lessen their
importance and they should not be ignored simply because they cannot be easily costed.
7 Part E: Supporting guidance
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Understanding benefits and methods for estimating their monetary value is still developing. Advances in
areas relevant to SuDS, such as the value of ecosystem services, are now providing key benefit valuation
information that is being used in tools such Digman et al (2015) (Section 35.4.7).
In some cases, valuation of benefits can be undertaken using a preference-based approach, such as
“willingness to pay” as described in Box 35.1.
BOX
35.1
ames of methods for uantifin benefits
ontinent aluation or illinness to ay
The contingent valuation (CV) method, using sample evidence from questionnaires and surveys,
estimates how much people would be willing to pay for specific environmental or social benefits.
In some cases, people are asked for the amount of compensation they would be willing to accept
to give up specific benefits. The term contingent valuation reflects that people are asked to
state their willingness to pay, contingent on a specific hypothetical scenario and description of the
environmental service. Water service providers in England use such methods to determine customer
priorities for asset investments in their five-year plans.
Benefit transfer
To carry out a CV study requires a significant investment in time and resources. Sometimes this is
not feasible or not considered the best use of resources. An increasing number of studies carried
out in the UK (eg to value water quality improvements, the benefits of reduced air pollution and the
value of ecologically important species) make use of other CV studies using a benefit transfer (or
value transfer) approach. This adjusts the values found from other studies by taking into account the
characteristics of the study area, and can be a good indication of the range of possible values that
might be expected from a full CV study.
Shamier (201) provides guidance on this for river basin management planning, which can also be
applied to SuDS. The UK Government also has guidelines for valuing environmental impacts using
value transfer in appraisals (Eftec, 2010).
Hedonic pricing
Hedonic pricing is a method used in a number of benefit valuations. It relies on indirect information,
such as that provided by households when they make their property purchase location decisions.
Higher housing prices and lower wages reveal how much people are willing to pay for the amenities
in desirable locations and the added value that SuDS provide is reflected in this.
In one USA study (Johnstone et al, 2006) the improvements to water quality due to SuDS was
estimated by hedonic pricing as adding some 5 to the value of undeveloped riverside properties
and some 1015 for developed riverside residential properties. A study in Denmark (hou et al,
201) estimated by hedonic pricing that property values reduced by 1.7 for every 1 increase in
distance to local lakes (whether or not these were integrated into a green area).
onuantifiabe benefits
Where benefits cannot be quantified in monetary terms, these can still be assessed in a qualitative way.
The extent to which this is necessary (ie would consideration of these benefits influence the decision
making) and how this is done needs to be agreed by the partners involved in making the decision. Often
this is by negotiation, as various criteria (or benefits) may be of a greater or lesser importance to the
various parties involved.
As many of the benefits will be provided to the local community, community engagement exercises can
provide useful information for a qualitative assessment. For example, the community could be asked
questions such as “How much more outdoor activity do you think you would do if you had more public
green space?”
Chapter 5 Costs and benefits
749
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
At its simplest level, a qualitative assessment can compare the relative scale of benefits, such as
1 no added benefit
2 some benefit
medium benefit
significant benefit.
Qualitative assessments like this need to be considered separately in the decision-making process from
the quantitative outcomes described above.
However, in cases where some (but not all) of the benefits can be directly monetised, a qualitative
assessment can act as the starting point for quantifying the remaining benefits by providing switching or
implied monetary values. This becomes a worthwhile exercise where the non-monetised benefits have
a score of 3 or 4 based on the scale given above.
For example, where the monetised benefits amount to say, 9 m for a scheme costing 10 m, the non-
monetised benefits would need to have an implied value of at least 1 m to have a positive benefitcost
ratio (Section 35.5.2).
Alternatively, the monetised benefits can be used as a benchmark for benefits that are not directly
quantifiable. For example, stakeholder engagement can be used to score and weight non-monetised
benefits against benefits that have been monetised and provide an estimated implied monetary value
(Section 35.5.1). This process should include sensitivity analysis to check the relative significance of
the results from the scoring and weighting exercise, and any other assumptions used. An appropriate
uncertainty range can then be applied to the resultant estimations.
This process is most worthwhile if the non-monetised benefits are likely to have a significant effect on the
determination of the preferred option. Depending on the information readily available for quantifying some
benefits, it can also be a less costly alternative to using contingent valuation, benefit transfer etc methods
(Box 35.2) or can be used to validate the results from these methods (Penning-Rowsell et al, 201).
Some benefits are sometimes deemed as inappropriate to monetise, depending on the purpose of the
analysis and with whom it will be communicated, in which case a cost-effectiveness analysis approach
can be adopted (Section 35.5.3).
enefit attribution
Although there are many potential benefits provided by SuDS, these do not necessarily only come about
by delivering a SuDS scheme. For example, green areas alone can provide a number of the benefits, even
where SuDS are not included in these areas, such as recreational space and urban heat island mitigation.
It is therefore important that benefits are attributed correctly and only to where they are provided by SuDS
components alone, especially if comparing development options with and without SuDS.
35.4.5 Double counting
There are two main potential sources of double counting when estimating benefits
1 overlap between benefit categories (ale ) and/or using the same population for different
benefit categories, such as for both recreation and health and wellbeing
2 using benefit transfer values or similar (Box 35.2) that include more than just the specific benefit
being valued
These need to be taken into consideration when identifying which benefits are going to be assessed and
the best estimation method to adopt. All assumptions should be made clear, along with the implications of
these assumptions.
750 Part E: Supporting guidance
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
imin and sain benefits
The timing and physical scale of SuDS use is important in assessing relative benefits. The benefits
provided by an individual component, such as a tree pit, cannot be assumed to be linearly scalable
upward where larger or multiple components are being used. This is especially true where biodiversity
is considered, as interconnectedness of green spaces is a major determining factor in supporting
ecosystems. Therefore, where there is a gradual implementation of green SuDS over time and space,
there may be a step change in benefits when these reach a particular level of interconnectedness.
Also, the future is unknown and, therefore, the future benefits that are realised may not be as anticipated.
In other words, in the future, one or more of the expected benefits considered valuable today may
become less or more important in response to changes in circumstances (whether economic, social or
environmental). The most flexible option is the option that can still provide benefit value even under
future changes.
Guidance on how to include timescales and flexibility in benefit assessment is included in Digman et al (2015).
35.4.7 Tools and further guidance
Royal Haskoning (2012) provides a literature review of costs and benefits of SuDS in the UK (including
available case study evidence), but information on the monetary value of benefits is limited.
A detailed description of the multiple benefits of SuDS is provided in Digman et al (2015), together with
recommendations for considering temporal and spatial scales and uncertainties.
Digman et al (2015) provides a freely available spreadsheet tool designed for those interested in
assessing SuDS benefits. This tool, together with its accompanying guidance, enables a wide range of
financial, social and environmental benefits of SuDS to be captured and included in decision-making
for drainage infrastructure investments. The tool provides a practical means of assessing and, where
feasible, monetising the multiple benefits of SuDS schemes (from small to large schemes). The tool
enables alternative SuDS designs to be compared with each other or to a conventional drainage design
or any base case.
The tool includes 20 benefit categories, of which the monetary value can be assessed for 1 of these.
A database of monetary values is included, although locally derived values should be used as far as
practicable.
Jayasooriya and Ng (201) provide an international review of other available tools for assessing costs and
benefits related to SuDS.
35.5 COMPARING COSTS AND BENEFITS
In order to carry out an assessment that compares costs and benefits, it is important to consider whole-
life costs (Section 35.2.1) based on appropriate discounting (Section 35.2.2), and it is also important to
consider the benefits alongside costs in a way that they can be readily compared (economic or multi-
criteria analysis).
Each of the partners in a scheme may take a different approach to economic analysis (in some cases
due to regulatory regime requirements) and it is therefore important to establish from the outset how the
economic assessment will be carried out. There are no regulatory standards for economic analysis for
SuDS, rather there are standards set out for the various interested parties (eg the Environment Agency
for river basin management planning or water service providers for asset management), each of which
will need to be satisfied if their organisation is to be a partner in a particular scheme.
Some of the most common methods are described below. These are often used in combination in
scheme appraisals.

Yorkshire Water investigated the potential of different options to reduce CSO spills in Roundhay Park
in Leeds, as part of the Periodic Review 1 planning work. This included assessing the benefits of the
options using an ecosystem services approach. See Digman et al (2015).
Four options were considered, using a range of conventional drainage and SuDS approaches.
ale summarises the options and the range of expected benefits associated with each.
Option 1: a conventional solution to store water in tanks at CSOs to limit the volume spilling
Option 2: a conventional option that also solves predicted flooding in the catchment (giving
similar hydraulic performance in the combined sewer network as in options 3 and 4)
Option 3: a SuDS approach in public areas to disconnect surface water from the combined
system and pass it through the conveyance and storage SuDS
Option 4: as option 3 with measures added in residential private locations

indicates a negative impact, indicates a positive impact.
A comparison of the costs and benefits (Figure 35.6) shows how the different options are associated
with a big range in net present value. Option 1 reduced the CSO spills but offered no other benefits.
Option 2 provided similar levels of drainage performance in the sewer network to Options 3 and 4, but
created less benefit having underground infrastructure, and was also less resilient to climate change.
Options 3 and 4 included distributed SuDS features across the catchment, creating a second drainage
network to manage surface water, in turn creating wider benefits to the community and environment with
similar costs and benefits. Overall, the public SuDS option generated a positive NPV (benefits greater
than costs).

Figure 5.6 Comparison of options costs vs benefits
et resent aue
The net present value (NPV) of a scheme (ie calculating the total value of the scheme in terms of costs
and benefits over its lifetime Box 35.1) can be used as a means to compare the overall value of a SuDS
design compared with a conventional piped drainage scheme or to identify which SuDS design offers the
best value for money.
The process for determining the NPV of a scheme is illustrated in Figure 35.7 . Where all benefits can be
monetised (Section 35.4.2), this is a relatively straightforward process (Figure 35.7a).
Where some benefits cannot be monetised, these can be implied by assessing their likely value
compared to the benefits that can be directly monetised (Setion an iure ).
Care also needs to be taken to ensure that when options are being compared that appropriate
consideration is given to:
benefit attribution (Section 35.4.4) and the fact that different options will have different groups of benefits
timing and scaling of benefits (Section 35.4.6).

enefitost ratio
The benefitcost ratio (BCR) is the ratio between the benefits and costs for a scheme can be used to
determine whether it is value for money. This type of analysis does require all costs and benefits to be
quantified (whether directly or implied), as per the NPV analysis.
The benefits included in the assessment need to be agreed and applied consistently, if different schemes
are being compared, but importantly they can be multiple in nature. For example, a benefit to cost ratio
(BCR) of 1 has been applied to flood defence related decision-making in England for a number of years.
In this instance, benefits include wider considerations, including cultural services as part of ecosystem
services valuation (ie it is not just about flood defence see Eftec, 2010).
osteffetieness anasis
Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) is a form of economic analysis that compares the relative cost to
benefit, sometimes described as the change in outcome for a unit of investment. For example, What is
the reduction in flooding as a result of a unit increase in storage volume This is typically used where
there is only a single criterion (or benefit) being measured.
This type of analysis may be particularly helpful when considering the incremental increase in benefit
value over time, for example, the impact of street tree growth on the gradual improvement in air quality.
35.5.4 Multi-criteria analysis
Multi-criteria analysis (MCA) is an umbrella term used for applying non-quantitative assessment
techniques (alongside quantitative results where available), where stakeholders believe that there are
significant benefits beyond those that can be monetised, and these should be included in the decision-
making process.
MCA provides an open and explicit way of presenting monetised and non-monetised impacts of a scheme
(ie costs and benefits) to decision-makers, which has a number of advantages over informal judgement.
These include the provision of an audit trail, a useful means of communicating complex ideas, scores and
weights that can be compared with other studies (to improve confidence) and the possibility of applying
sensitivity testing.
35.5.5 Tools and further guidance
Many of the concepts introduced in this chapter are discussed in more detail in Penning-Rowsell et al
(201). This document (known as the Multi-Coloured Manual) presents a range of techniques and data
that can be used in a practical way to assess costs and benefits related to flood risk management and
coastal erosion. The techniques and much of the data is equally relevant to SuDS. The manual also
provides details of the derivation of the data presented and the limitations of benefitcost analysis.
Complementary to this manual is a handbook that provides a step-by-step guide to assessing benefits,
which is available online (Penning-Rowsell et al, 2015).
DCLG (2009) provides useful (relatively non-technical) guidance on BCR, CEA and MCA techniques, and
Maxwell et al (2011) provides guidance on MCA specifically focusing on social impacts and wellbeing.
Digman et al (2015) allows both financial (eg capital equipment, operating expenditure and opportunity
cost of providing land for SuDS) and other costs (eg social or environmental costs such as embodied
carbon in materials) for SuDS options to be compared with their benefits (see the case study above).

Health and safety
This chapter provides guidance on health and safety principles and
practices relevant to SuDS. The chapter is intended to provide guidance
to designers, drainage approval and adoption bodies, and the public on
health and safety aspects associated with SuDS, including:
• balancing the benefits of SuS with any potential health and safety riss
• good practice design approaches and principles to support the
appropriate management of ris to low levels
• bacground information to allow drainage approval bodies to be
confident that drainage assets will not pose a liability in either the
short or long term
• health and safety ris assessment of schemes inline with S E
31010:2010.
he guidance in this chapter is supported by the health and safety ris management
checlist included in Appendix
36.1 INTRODUCTION
36.1.1 Why should health and safety be considered?
The planning, design, construction and management of sustainable drainage systems
falls under the requirements of the Construction, Design and Management (CDM)
Regulations 2015. This and other relevant regulations and legislation are presented in
Section 36.5. This chapter can be used in helping to ensure that SuDS designs fulfil
regulatory and legal requirements, and SuDS health and safety risk assessments are in
line with BS EN 31010:2010.
This chapter only covers specific health and safety issues relating to the provision of
open water components (both permanent and temporary) as part of SuDS. It does not
cover general issues and regulation associated with standard health and safety at work
principles and conventional drainage design (eg confined spaces although these are
discussed briefly for completeness). Also, it does not cover issues such as highway
safety audits that may include some parts of a SuDS scheme (eg permeable pavements
or swales adjacent to highways).
36.1.2 When should health and safety be considered?
The SuDS designer has a responsibility to address health and safety under CDM 2015,
and must demonstrate this. Health and safety assessment will be a continuous process;
it does not just stop once the boxes are ticked. It should be discussed, and principles
agreed, at conceptual and outline design stages as part of the CDM designer’s risk
assessment process. The risk assessment should then be developed and reviewed at
all stages of design, construction and maintenance.
A health and safety assessment should be undertaken by the organisation approving
the drainage (drainage approving body) when assessing the design of a SuDS scheme.
It should also be reviewed following construction and also on a regular basis during
operation. The review should consider any changes that have been made to the
approved design during construction or operation (see HSE, 2015).

CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
36.2 SUDS HEALTH AND SAFETY: THE CONTEXT
SuDS aim to manage the runoff from development sites, following rainfall, in a way that:
mimics natural drainage processes
minimises negative impacts on the natural environment
reduces the risks of flooding both on site and downstream
supports the adaptability of the development to the negative effects of climate change
provides amenity, biodiversity and educational value for the site.
Well-designed SuDS components include features that are no more hazardous than those found in the
existing urban landscape, for example ponds in parks. Where communities understand and support the
above principles and values, then it is reasonable to expect them to embrace the improved landscape and
respond to such hazards in a positive, reasonable and responsible manner.
aanin riss and benefits
It is important to recognise the inherent tension between the individual leisure user and the various
permission givers, regulators and duty holders. Leisure, by definition, is to be free from drudgery, to enjoy
freedoms, to play and relax. Consumed (ie paid for) leisure can trigger regulations, imposing qualified
duties to manage risk.
An undesirable result can be the duty holder adopting an overly paternalistic approach, resulting from
a complex mix of misunderstanding, fear of prosecution or liability to negligence, or as a proxy for other
concerns such as a lack of resources and desire for privacy.
Counter-intuitively, the key to challenging risk aversion is the application of balanced risk assessment.
There is a need to accept that uncertainty is inherent in adventure and this contains the possibility of
adverse outcomes. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) sums up this approach as
follows: “We must try to make life as safe as necessary, not as safe as possible.”
When dealing with the design of public amenity space, it is important to weigh up the risk of harm against
the benefits of provision, that is with the objective of balancing positive attributes against the inevitable risk
of injury which any public activity generates (Ball and Ball-King, 2011). Publicly accessible green and blue
infrastructure (including SuDS) supports important societal benefits including health and wellbeing benefits
relating to improved quality of life, and recreational and educational benefits for children and adults.
As a society, we are prepared to broadly tolerate the risks posed by our road network, because of the
benefits and support it provides to our daily lifestyle. SuDS components that are on the surface (eg
ponds, basins, swales), if managed correctly and if the public are made aware of the risks, should come
to be accepted as important, necessary and beneficial ways of managing our societal impacts.
The benefits of providing a well-designed SuDS scheme are local and regional. The risks that need to
be considered should look at the local and regional situation and expectations, and balance these risks
appropriately.
36.2.2 Managing and informing public perception
The perception of SuDS, and in particular components that comprise bodies of open water, is important
as a driver for setting appropriate risk management principles.
A survey of residents living in areas with SuDS ponds was undertaken in 2002/ (HR Wallingford, 200).
The study confirmed the following
The level of education about sustainable water management, and SuDS in particular, was an
important factor to the perceived level of risk posed by the drainage system. Informed residents
760 Part E: Supporting guidance
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
tended to be much more positive than residents whose knowledge about the function of their local
SuDS scheme was non-existent or poor.
Natural aesthetics were shown to play an extremely important role in formulating public attitudes.
The more aesthetically pleasing the SuDS pond and the more natural it looked, the more it tended to
be welcomed by a community and the lower the importance attached to health and safety risks.
The effectiveness of the maintenance schedule (in particular relating to litter, pollution and silt
accumulation) was crucial in determining the community view of the system.
In general, the community valued SuDS ponds and felt that they added value to the area and to
their homes. The majority of those interviewed would prefer the pond to remain, irrespective of any
concerns they might have.
The main concerns about SuDS ponds were related to health and safety risks, and this outcome was
confirmed by a more recent study (Bastien et al, 2011).
Both studies confirmed that public education and good design and maintenance are crucial in managing
and addressing perceived risks. Education strategies should cover:
the functionality of the surface water management system where the water flows, where and why it
is stored, where it is released to, what would happen if it wasn’t there, how it will operate and how it
is likely to look in different seasons
the benefits afforded to the local community and wider society by the SuDS scheme, including
children’s education opportunities
the design measures in place to mitigate health and safety risks
how and when the system is maintained
the actions that the local community and amenity users should take to further minimise health and
safety risks (including effective litter control)
contact information if a health and safety or maintenance concern is identified.
Also, to allay concerns about open water, it should be clear to those using the surrounding amenity
space why it is important to manage and treat the runoff from our development areas and how it is
collected and stored. All flow and volume control components should be designed and operate in a
predictable and safe manner.
36.3 EFFECTIVE HEALTH AND SAFETY RISK MANAGEMENT
36.3.1 The principles
Competent, best practice SuDS design should mean that health and safety risks are considered throughout
the design process. The results should be that risks are reduced to acceptable levels by designing out
hazards. The following sections summarise the key best practice SuDS design principles that support
the appropriate management and mitigation of risk. They are part of the standard SuDS design practice
recommended in the individual technical component chapters and are provided here for completeness. The
sections relate to the mitigation of risk related to specific potential haards. All the recommendations in this
chapter should be confirmed as appropriate through site-specific risk assessment.
36.3.2 Drowning risk management
Drowning can occur in permanent bodies of water or in normally dry areas when they contain water
temporarily during and after rainfall events. Drowning more frequently occurs from accidentally falling
in rather than by deliberately accessing a body of water and then getting into difficulty. The risk may
be increased during the hours of darkness and when there is unsupervised access to open water,
particularly by younger children or those under the influence of alcohol or drugs.
Chapter 36: Health and safety
761
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
The risk of drowning is also exacerbated when features such as steep banks, deep bankside or water-
edge silt and/or overhanging branches are present. Fast flowing water or areas that become inundated
very quickly with a rapid rise in water level may also increase the risk of drowning. Such hazards should
always be avoided in SuDS designs.
In 2011, there were 407 reported cases of drowning. Of these deaths, 22 were recorded as occurring
in ponds or ditches/burns. The best available information suggests that three hospitalisations occur for
every death.
Drowning of very young children is obviously a significant concern. The latest statistics for drowning in the
UK show that, of the 0-year-old children drowned, the majority were walking or running next to water,
rather than being involved in a water-based activity (NWSF, 2012).
In practice, a variety of risk controls will likely be implemented. The exact controls will, of course, be site
specific. In many cases simple controls will ensure that the haards are easy to recognise, avoid and do
not pose a significant risk.
Fencing
It is not reasonable, practical or desirable to attempt to prevent drowning by denying access to every
piece of water across the UK. Fencing may be an effective but comparatively expensive option which
does not remove all the risks arising from water.
The early response to water features in the landscape was to deny access through metal fencing, hedging
and planting barriers. However, although physical barriers might be suitable where the risks are high, the
provision of pedestrian fencing is frequently challenged by designers, health and safety experts and often
by the local community itself. Barriers can prevent or obstruct visual observance of the water body, and the
provision of help in an emergency.
Where the water is accessible, the edge gradient above and below the water line, and the depth profile of
the water are of critical importance (see Access to the water).
If the risk is high, either due to the required nature of the edge, the hinterland activity or a combination of
the two then fencing may be deemed necessary. The height and nature of the fence along with location in
relation to the water feature are important considerations. At lower risk sites the function of a barrier may
be merely to deflect the public from the water’s edge. At particularly sensitive locations, such as pinch
points or where water is deeper, more substantial fencing may be required.
Where it is considered likely that unsupervised young children could gain access to the water, then a
toddler-proof fence 600750 mm high should be provided to prevent toddlers getting to the water but
allow adult entry to step across when necessary. The fence should be a vertical pale type rather than
horizontal rail construction which could be used as a climbing frame.
Where fences are provided, full responsibility for maintenance must be established to ensure that liability
risks are minimised.
If fencing is not appropriate, different types of planting at the margin can provide an element of physical
protection and create a clearly identifiable visual border. If it is not possible to provide a planted margin
then clear identification of the edge of the water can be beneficial.
Siting
Careful consideration as to the positioning and design of a SuDS pond is important in terms of minimising
misuse and vandalism, and increasing natural surveillance.
An open and accessible situation with local roads, footpaths and houses providing a high degree of
natural surveillance from surrounding properties and residents will serve to reduce risks and maximise
potential amenity benefits.
762 Part E: Supporting guidance
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Access to the water
Where the water is accessible, the edge gradient above and below the water line and the depth profile of
the water are important. In many situations, paddling in the water would be considered acceptable and
safe. However, swimming in SuDS components should be actively discouraged. A safe approach is to
design the edge of the permanent or temporary body of water with:
1 a “dry bench” before the component to provide a level surface for an individual to assess the
surroundings; this could be designed with a reverse slope to stop anyone slipping or riding
unhindered into the water
2 all slopes (where people have direct access) not greater than 1 in 3, to allow unaided movement in
either direction for able-bodied visitors or maintenance personnel to mow and clear vegetation
3 a level “wet bench” at or just below the normal water surface level which will be both clearly wet
and uncomfortable underfoot for anyone who has accessed the water body; this may dry out
occasionally in exceptionally dry periods but by and large will remain boggy; the appropriate width of
this bench will be dependent on the size of the water body, but a reasonable minimum is considered
to be 1.5 m
clear identification of the water edge, for example using planting or soft or hard edging (where appropriate).
Access to the water can be discouraged where appropriate through the use of
shallow, muddy margins
reeds and shrubs that do not obstruct visibility, but provide a safe deterrent and barrier to paddling
and swimming.
It is important that barrier planting does not obstruct visibility of the water from the surrounding area.
An appropriate maintenance strategy for the bank edges of the water body should be established to
ensure long-term public safety.
Consideration should be given to the structure’s intended use, the local profile and the needs of
residents in terms of things like lighting, disabled access, visibility of waterside edges, changes in
levels, as is appropriate for the location and the requirements of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995
and associated duties.
Water bod and ood eeedane storae or oneane desin
Most SuDS designs should not be using components close to houses or other buildings where normal still
water depths are greater than 600 mm, or normal velocities are greater than 0.5 m/s.
Where deeper and larger components are required, such as regional water features in recreational
areas or parks, it is recommended that a level bench should be provided at a depth of 0.6 m before
descent to a maximum depth of 1.5 m, at a maximum gradient of 1 in 2.5. It is considered that a
reasonable minimum width is 1.5 m. Where practicable, shallower gradients should be considered to
suit the surface area of the pond.
Water velocities in SuDS should not be high if an efficient drainage scheme using source control in sub-
catchments is provided. The maximum water velocity in an open component should be low enough so that if
anyone inadvertently enters the water’s edge they can remain standing. The same principle should be applied
to flood flows for events up to the 1100 year (1 annual probability of occurrence) or 1200 year event (0.5
annual probability of occurrence), where floodwater may be conveyed and stored in exceedance ones.
Table 36.1 gives an interpretation of the guidance provided by Defra (2006) for SuDS application.

Note that this applies to accessible SuDS or the edges of regional ponds. Large regional ponds may have
water depths greater than 1.5 m.
Infants, small children and frail/elderly persons are considered unsafe in any flow without adult support.
In cases where they are expected to be present without supervision, careful siting, design and fencing
should be used to manage the risk appropriately.
Other adverse conditions that can affect the level of risk and should be taken into account are:
bottom conditions uneven, slippery, obstacles
flow conditions low temperature, poor visibility, unsteady flow and flow aeration which affects
visibility of the bottom
strong wind
poor lighting.
If any of these adverse conditions are present and cannot be designed out, then lower water depths and
velocities should be considered.
ifesain euiment
Life rings and other pieces of public rescue equipment (PRE) have often been provided unnecessarily in the
past. Thought should be given to the type of PRE needed (eg life ring or throw bags), if the water conditions
and location suggest that one is needed (should anyone enter the water). For PRE to be effective, the person
in the water needs to be noticed when in trouble, which is affected by the siting of a pond.
PRE is frequently abused and its presence can provide a false sense of security for those thinking
of entering the water. Where they are provided, they should be regularly inspected, maintained and
immediately replaced if used or missing.
Signs
In a public area, signs may be the only way of educating users about health and safety risks or how to
use the rainwater runoff play system or feature. This can support local water safety or safety awareness
activities, such as school based or community water safety training.
Signs may be used to educate the public. If deep water or other significant haards exist (which are not
recommended for SuDS design), the logical place for the display of safety signs is at all access points
to sites, where all visitors will view the information. Therefore signs should be put in places such as
entrances and visitors’ car parks.
The following information should be included on the board (if appropriate):
site name
764 Part E: Supporting guidance
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
emergency instruction: “Dial 999 in an emergency”
main hazard and prohibition symbols and supplementary text
details of site supervision services and contact details
location and postcode (needs to be understood by local emergency services)
site map showing, rescue equipment, first aid and supervisory help, telephones
organisational logos.
Signs and information are commonly provided with any PRE that is provided to form a “safety point” or
“safety station”.
As well as the information provided at access points, provision should be made to repeat the message
along routes adjacent to the water’s edge, where specific higher risk situations exist. These are known
as “nag signs”, and are repeat messages, small reinforcement messages of key hazard or prohibition
messages given previously on the primary or secondary signs. They should relate directly to the hazard
that they are in close proximity to and should be predominantly symbol-based messages with reinforcing
text. They are normally located next to the hazard, at places where visitors are most likely to access the
water. These could be (for example):
pinch points on walkways or paths
jetties or platforms
locations where entry might be expected
viewing platforms
other key hazards determined on site.
There will be many locations on site where nag signs can be placed. However, it is crucial, that only the
key locations are signed; using too many nag signs will have a detrimental effect on the overall message.
Where the system includes significant areas of open water, the site will require monitoring for ice
formation, and appropriate temporary warning signs will be needed (RoSPA should be approached for
advice in such scenarios).
36.3.3 Slip and fall risk management
Physical injuries, such as falls, slips, trips and entrapment, should be no more prevalent at SuDS
components than at any other natural or amenity feature, provided that good design principles have
been followed and that consideration has been given to the potentially increased likelihood of wet and
slippery conditions.
Of the 07 reported cases of drowning in 2011 (NWSF, 2012), 7 resulted from walking or running next to
water. The steepness of the bank, freeboard, condition of the pathways and additional hazards should all
be given significant consideration to ensure that a trip or stumble does not result in a fall into deep or fast
flowing water. This includes consideration of the perception and abilities of the very young, very old and
people with disabilities, as much as lighting and the expected site activities.
Accessible surfaces that convey runoff, or through which runoff is designed to pass, may be more
vulnerable to a deterioration in structural integrity or build-up of algae that can cause the surface to
become slippery, and potentially result in ice formation during winter months.
Structural integrity
All SuDS components should be structurally sound for use, taking into account the likelihood of vandalism
or misuse, the durability of materials and the planned maintenance regime.
Chapter 36: Health and safety
765
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Any structural surfaces designed for accessibility should be suitably slip resistant, particularly those
where surface water flow can be expected. The risks associated with ice formation should also be
considered and managed appropriately, but the same considerations as for general water safety will
apply shallow water features are preferred.
Vertical drops and steep-sided structures
Good SuDS design should avoid the need for high vertical drops or deep steep-sided structures. In
many cases, such haards can be avoided by sensible profiling slopes of headwalls, or risks reduced by
locating such structures away from open water. High headwalls should not be necessary in an efficient
drainage design where flows are managed in sub-catchments.
If steep slopes and high vertical drops cannot be removed from the design, consideration should be
given to how the risk is managed effectively and to access arrangements for maintenance (this is a
CDM requirement). Vehicle movements should also be given careful consideration where SuDS are
close to roadways.
ee hanes
Unexpected changes in level, particularly if not immediately visible, should be avoided. Slopes should be
gentle, at 1 in 3 or less, where accessible, and other changes in level visible and expected.
Inlets, outlets and safety grilles
Safety grilles are only required on pipes of 50 mm diameter (WRc, 2012). An efficient SuDS design
should not require large pipes in most cases. Where grilles are provided, they should follow the guidance
in WRc (2012).
36.3.4 Ill health from untreated or polluted water risk management
Rainwater runoff in SuDS components is no different from the water that runs across roads and car parks
and stands as puddles for lengthy periods after rainfall. Many existing water features in parks and public
open spaces already take highway runoff. Indeed, with good SuDS design and effective source control,
accessible SuDS components should contain “treated” runoff, and therefore any pollution levels should
be very low.
However, as with any natural water bodies, water in SuDS could potentially contain toxins that could
potentially cause ill health, and there are management principles that should be followed to minimise
potential risks.
Blue-green algae, leptospirosis, cryptosporidium and E. coli are examples of possible toxins. However, as
with pollutants, the risks associated with the presence of these in SuDS components should be, at worst,
no greater than in, for example, recreational ponds in parks, and it should be lower in a well-designed
SuDS Management Train that removes pollution at source. Robust routine inspection and operation and
maintenance practices should deal with the low risks associated with these hazards.
Weil’s disease and blue-green algae
Weil’s disease is a form of bacterial infection also known as leptospirosis which is carried by animals,
most commonly in rats and cattle. It can be caught by humans through contact with rat or cattle urine,
present in contaminated fresh water, including ponds, lakes, rivers and canals. Infection of humans
usually occurs where open wounds are immersed in contaminated water.
Employees who work near water should be provided with a workers’ card that can be presented to their
doctor if symptoms appear. This means that they can be diagnosed and treated quickly, reducing the
likelihood of severe infection.
766 Part E: Supporting guidance
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Blue-green algae tends to occur in warm water bodies with high nutrient content. “Stagnant” water is
polluted water with a high nutrient content.
Water in SuDS should not be stagnant, but have low nutrient levels and be relatively clean. Nutrient
removal upstream of pond systems should be considered in the design.
Disease-carrying and/or nuisance insects
There are a number of nuisance insects that use temporary water to lay eggs with the characteristic
comma-shaped larvae changing into adults in 2 weeks in summer. Mosquitos are one of these insects,
but the high-risk diseases that they are known to carry (eg malaria, West Nile virus) are not found in the
UK, and mosquitos here are not currently implicated in the transmission of any diseases. Mosquitos are
a natural part of the ecosystem, and many species such as bats, birds, invertebrates and amphibians,
plus dragon fly nymphs predate on them. The most likely habitat for mosquitoes will be features such as
water butts, which should therefore be covered at all times, blocked roof drainage gullies or other small
stagnant water-containing features occurring in or around gardens.
There are measures that can reduce the nuisance of breeding insects. Their larvae are often predated
by other living things within a balanced pond habitat and this should be the objective of any permanent or
temporary water body design.
astrointestina disorders resutin from touhin and subseuent aidenta inestion of
roofharested rainater
Theoretically, such disorders could result from children playing with rainwater harvested from roofs,
where the roof is contaminated by bird and/or animal faeces. However, a literature review of potential
health risks from roof harvested rainwater suggests that the hazard is likely to be very low.
In summary:
faecal contamination indicators for roof runoff have been found to be insignificant or very low
faecal coliform counts from roofs have been found to be significantly lower than for streets and
driveways
the risk associated with the use of harvested runoff for showering and/or hosing gardens has been
gauged to be well below acceptable levels (and therefore even lower for SuDS where the pathogens
are not aerosolised)
the health risk associated with direct ingestion of a harvested supply due to cross-connections
associated with a rainwater harvesting system has been gauged to be lower than the risk of being
struck by lightning.
Safe working practices
The risk of contaminated, stagnant water occurring in well-designed SuDS components/schemes is very
low, and the subsequent risk of a resultant adverse health issue is even lower. Those most likely to be at
risk will be maintenance staff, and safe systems of work should be observed to mitigate any remaining
risk. Checking for open cuts, and the use of nitrile gloves, waterproof plasters or other skin coverings
should be considered wherever working in or near any open water body, including SuDS.
For maintenance operatives, employers have a duty to employees to inform them about the risks of their
work environment and to decrease the risk as far as is reasonably practicable. This includes personal
protective equipment (PPE) provision and policy implementation based on risk assessment. Employees
who work near water should be provided with a workers’ card that can be presented to their doctor if
symptoms that relate to water body exposure appear. This means that they can be diagnosed and treated
quickly, reducing the likelihood of severity of infection.
Chapter 36: Health and safety
767
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Litter management
A robust litter management strategy should be implemented for all sites, as part of good landscape
maintenance practice, through the provision of litter bins and regular litter collection and site litter picks. This
will reduce the risks of rats frequenting the area looking for food. The importance of litter removal and the
potential risks associated with waterborne diseases should be addressed as part of public education material.
Water uait manaement
Where water bodies are accessible amenity features, the upstream SuDS Management Train should
have removed the majority of contaminants, delivering a relatively clean flow of freshwater to the pond or
wetland component.
Where rainwater is captured in amenity play features, this water is likely to contain contaminants, and
therefore drinking by children should be actively discouraged. However, roof water is relatively clean,
and contact should not normally be a problem, although it is recommended that measures are taken
to discourage the use of large roofs by large colonies of flocking birds or rodents where the runoff is to
be harvested for use. If the design of the SuDS uses the conveyance or storage of rainwater to provide
further intermittent play opportunities for slightly longer periods of time after it has rained, the water
should be treated at least once, if it is not roof water, using SuDS treatment measures such as gravel
filters or vegetation filters. If runoff is captured from busy roads, it should go through at least two cleaning
stages before it is suitable for play.
ainater harestin sstem desin
RWHs should be designed to BS 5152009A1200 so that the collection and storage facility is fit
for purpose and includes all appropriate features to guard against undue risk. Any mains water supply
that may be installed for example to ensure continuity of supply in dry spells, must be configured with
backflow protection in accordance with the Water Supply (Water Fittings) Regulations 1999. The stored
water is certain to contain some foreign material from the catchment surfaces and this could include
guano, plant and animal remains, and legionella has also been identified in harvested rainwater. It is
therefore a requirement of the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations 2002 to carry out
a suitable and sufficient assessment of the risks constituted by any potentially pathogenic microbes in the
context of the installation, its mode of operation and the proposed use of the water.
36.3.5 Aircraft safety risk management
Arrangements for airport safeguarding are explained in ODPM (200), which includes the text of the Town
and Country Planning (Safeguarded Aerodromes, Technical Sites and Military Explosives Storage Areas)
Direction 2002. Consultation is required within a 13 km zone around an aerodrome where a proposed
development is likely to attract birds. Note that the term aerodrome is defined in the Civil Aviation Act
192 and is essentially an area of land or water set aside for aircraft to land or take off. Airport is defined
in the Airports Act 196, and is the aerodrome plus all the buildings and facilities.
Generally, decisions concerning local land use and planning issues, including cases where local
aerodromes may be affected, are the responsibility of the local planning authorities. The Civil Aviation
Authority (CAA) is not routinely a statutory consultee for planning applications. The CAA does have a role
in providing relevant aviation safety advice upon request.
In all cases, aerodrome safeguarding responsibility rests with the aerodrome licence holder/operator
(not the CAA). Therefore, any local planning authority enquiry concerning a specific development that
might have aerodrome safeguarding implications should be forwarded directly to the relevant aerodrome
licence holder/operator.
The CAA has identified SuDS components, in particular ponds, wetlands and green roofs, as a potential
haard to aircraft. Although the main concern is wildfowl including flocks of ducks, geese and swans,
there is also concern about other flocking species such as rooks, starlings and gulls. Further advice is
provided in AOA and GAAC (2006).
768 Part E: Supporting guidance
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
The risk to aircraft can be mitigated by good ecological design including:
long grass rather than the short grass preferred by geese
small pools and ponds with edges accessible by predators such as foxes
planting design to reduce the risk of roosting by birds in large numbers.
The use of certain SuDS components near to aerodromes will also depend on the site-specific
circumstances such as location relative to the aerodrome and location of other features in the area that
are attractive to birds.
This is a complex subject, and specialists in bird strike prevention and safeguarding aerodromes should
be consulted. Smaller open SuDS components, such as small swales and small shallow ponds, and
associated features, such as rills and small canals or channels, are not likely to attract birds any more
than a garden pond or lawn.
36.4 HEALTH AND SAFETY RISK ASSESSMENT REQUIREMENTS
36.4.1 Background
Good SuDS design and risk management processes during design (following the guidance and principles
set out earlier in this chapter) should deliver drainage systems that are safe. The requirements of the
CDM hierarchy should be adopted: identify, eliminate, reduce, control.
There will, however, remain a need for designers of drainage systems to check (and also demonstrate
and record) that health and safety risks have been considered and suitably mitigated by the design.
Those bodies approving and adopting SuDS will also require a health and safety check so that the long-
term safety of the local community, those visiting the site and operation and maintenance operatives are
not compromised. Such records are essential to minimise the risk of being held liable for any future health
and safety incident that occurred on a site.
The following section sets out a proposed approach to consistent health and safety risk assessment
for SuDS, in-line with the principles set out in BS EN 31010:2010. The guidance and principles set out
in Section 6 should be referred to when assessing the level of risk for any particular item. Legislation
relevant to health and safety risk management for SuDS is summarised in Section 36.5, for context and
ease of reference.
36.4.2 Risk assessment
There is a need to be able to determine the following issues with respect to risk at any particular drainage site:
Which site/system characteristics potentially represent haards
When might these haards represent a risk (either independently or together)
To what extent might the local/visiting population be vulnerable to the haard
What is the likelihood of a consequence occurring
At what level is the risk, and how acceptable is it, taking the local cultural context into account
Would mitigation of the risk reduce the societal benefit derived from the SuDS
Are the risks small enough to be acceptable
Risk assessment involves systematically identifying hazards (ie anything that has the potential to cause
harm), the evaluation of the risks related to those hazards and the establishment of control measures in
order to reduce the risk to as low as is necessary or appropriate.
Chapter 36: Health and safety
769
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Riskbenefit assessment starts with (a) identifying the benefits (eg visual amenity, recreational,
biodiversity or use of pond for educational purposes), (b) considering the potential risks; (c) reviewing the
possible responses to these risks before making a judgement on measures. All elements should be fully
recorded in order to provide an audit trail (Gill, 2010).
The following process (and the checklist provided in Appendix B) is based on principles that are widely
used in other risk assessment fields, including CDM risk assessments.
A risk assessment process is shown in Figure 36.1.
A risk assessment should be carried out as part of the design of SuDS. It should be evaluated by
the drainage approving body, revisited at construction inspection and adoption approval stages and
monitored and reviewed as part of the site maintenance procedures.
Figure 6.1 Risk assessment process
Risk is a combination of the likelihood of something occurring and the consequences if it does occur. A
common method of assessing risk in many other fields is to use a risk matrix such as the one provided in
Table 36.2. The greater the consequences the lower the probability of occurrence has to be for the risk to
be acceptable. For example, drowning to children is a rare but socially unacceptable event.

36.5 HEALTH AND SAFETY LEGISLATION
The UK health and safety laws are designed to ensure that those in control of premises do what is
reasonably practicable to ensure the safety of employees, contractors and the public.
The following statutory instruments impose obligations and duties to ensure that staff and members of the
public are not exposed to risks to their health and safety:
The Health and Safety at Work etc Act 197
The Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999
The Occupier’s Liability Acts of 1957 and 19
The Public Health Act 196.
Health and safety of structures, including SuDS, starts with design, and all SuDS designers must
be familiar with and follow the specific requirements of CDM 2015. CDM 2015 is aimed at improving
the overall management and co-ordination of health, safety and welfare throughout all stages of a
construction project and the Regulations place duties on all those who can contribute to the health and
safety of a structure. Risk assessments at the design stage are an important step and should include the
identification of any haards in the design, suitable actions to eliminate or reduce the risks to builders,
maintainers and users of the structure (eg the public) and the information required regarding residual
risks in order that they may be effectively controlled on site. Early design decisions and assumptions
affect health and safety because they influence the choice of materials, construction methods and
the build programme, as well as design characteristics and SuDS locations. In addition to the CDM
Regulations, designers should consider the implications of the Building Regulations in terms of access
and protection from falls and any additional requirements that may be relevant to meet the requirements
of the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999. The Workplace (Health, Safety and
Welfare) Regulations 1992 will also apply as the SuDS scheme will become a workplace from time to time
during maintenance.
Consideration needs to be given to the whole SuDS scheme and not just any ponds that may be created.
For example
Will roof maintenance be needed on a green roof. If so, how will this be conducted safely For
example, will harness eye bolts be needed
Will permeable paving become uneven quickly How will this be inspected and managed
Will rills be used for paddling How will this be encouraged safely
The asset owner or occupier is ultimately responsible for conducting a suitable and sufficient assessment
of the SuDS for the use, inspection and maintenance of the system. However, the owner will need
sufficient information from the designer and developer to conduct this assessment and to be confident
that the system meets the required standards prior to adoption.
Under common law, the SuDS owner or occupier has a duty to potential visitors “to take reasonable care
to avoid acts or omissions which you can reasonably foresee would be likely to injure your neighbour”.
Reasonable care is defined as what a reasonable person would have foreseen as being necessary
and acknowledges that a certain level of risk is acceptable and it is expected that appropriate safety
measures will be applied in each circumstance. Each location and SuDS scheme will be different and
therefore blanket designs, features and characteristics will not necessarily be effective or appropriate.
The Occupiers’ Liability Acts (OLA) of 1957 and 19 govern to what extent landowners are responsible
for the health and safety of visitors and trespasses to their premises. Case law should be referenced to
clarify the specific implications of each of the Acts for SuDS owners and operators.

Appendix
BChecklists
This appendix provides a series of checklists that can be used by
designers or drainage system approving bodies to ensure that all
relevant design, construction and maintenance considerations have been
taken into account and documented in a consistent way.
B.1 SUDS DESIGN AND LAND USE PLANNING SUBMISSIONS
The SuDS design process is set out in Chapter 7 , including the integration and links
with the (land use) planning process.
Each stage of the planning process will require a different level of submission detail
in terms of the design of the surface water management system, but the issues are
relevant for all scales of development. The following three subsections include guidance
and checklists relevant to each of the key stages that could be used by the planning
authority or the organisation responsible for drainage approval and adoption in their
consultation and planning process.
The scale of the submissions will be dependent on the scale of the development site and
the level of potential environmental risk posed by the surface water management system.
The proposed checklists will ensure that all issues have been considered at the correct
stage of planning. However, for small sites, many of the items may not be relevant, or
may only require cursory consideration. As indicated in Chapter 7, Figure 7.2, the outline
planning stage may not be required for small sites, and for many sites the Flood Risk
Assessment may include the conceptual drainage design strategy.
Where earlier stages are omitted, the submission requirements for that stage should be
included for consideration at subsequent stages to ensure that the planning process for
the system has taken all aspects into consideration.
B.1.1 Pre-application
Developers should engage in pre-application discussions with the drainage system
approving body, either directly or as part of a multi-disciplinary team involved with the
planning application to the local planning authority. Effective pre-application discussions
and master planning should ensure a robust, viable and cost-effective scheme from
the outset, where the development objectives are informed by the surface water
management strategy, and vice versa
For larger sites or multi-plot developments, where the land is subdivided into separate
plots owned by different landowners, or where there is an intention to develop the land
in phases, the specification for a drainage master plan should be agreed at this stage.
The master plan should be designed to ensure effective communication between all
developers and identified stakeholders in establishing the selection, implementation
and phasing of source control, site and regional SuDS components. It should also set
out the responsibilities for, delivery of and maintenance of temporary site drainage
measures required during the construction process.
Table B.1 provides a checklist of information that should be provided and agreed
between all parties at the pre-application stage.

Suggested pre-application discussion material
Ref Requirements Details (or reference
documentation)
Accepted?
(a)
Any planning and environmental objectives for the site that should influence the
surface water management strategy these objectives can be put forward by both the
developer and the approving body/LPA and should be agreed by all parties
(b)
The likely environmental or technical constraints to SuDS design for the site these
should be agreed by all parties
(c)
The requirements of the local SuDS approval and adoption processes. These should be
provided to the developer by the drainage approving body
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
(d) The suite of design criteria to be applied to the SuDS scheme (taking account of (a) to (c))
(e)
Evidence that the initial development design proposals have considered the integration
and linkage of the surface water management with street layouts, architectural and
landscape proposals
(f)
An assessment of strategic opportunities for the surface water management system
to deliver multiple benefits for the site this should be provided by the developer and
should include the strategic use of public open space for SuDS
(h)
The statutory and recommended non-statutory consultees for the design proposals
this should be provided by the approval body or LPA
(i) The likely land and infrastructure ownership for drainage routes and points of discharge
(including sewerage assets)
(j) An assessment of statutory consultee responsibilities and requirements, including
timescales for any likely required approvals/consents
(k)
Any potential local community impacts, health and safety issues or specific local
community concerns and drainage approving body requirements that should be
addressed by the detailed design
(m) An assessment of cost implications of stakeholder obligations
(n) An agreed approach to the design and maintenance of the surface water management
for the proposed site
Note
All of the above should be agreed (where relevant) with the LPA, internal drainage board, environmental regulator, water companies and sewerage undertakers. The SuDS planning process should be
closely linked to the development planning process, and the drainage design should be integrated where possible within the design of the development as a whole.
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
B.1.2 Outline planning
If an outline planning application is to be submitted to the local planning authority, the developer should
include a conceptual suds design strategy which can be reviewed by the drainage approving body and
their consultees, or others affected by the proposals (eg the local planning authority, environmental
regulator and the water and sewerage company). For some developments, this conceptual strategy may
form part of the FRA/FCA for the site.
Where a drainage master plan (or site surface water drainage strategy) is required or conditioned, at this
stage (for larger sites) this should also include:
details of the proposed phasing of the SuDS system
individual plot discharges and storages
definition of responsibilities for construction, maintenance and adoption of each element of the scheme.
Table B.2 provides a checklist that can be used to document and verify that the relevant information has
been provided. Note that if a pre-application consultation has been undertaken, much of the material
should have been agreed at that stage.
This information is required to be provided in the form of a report, together with appropriate plans.

B.2 SCHEME DESIGN CHECKLIST
Table B.4 provides a checklist that should be used when assessing the design of a proposed SuDS
scheme for approval. It encourages a consistent assessment of the scheme against the criteria and
standards set out in this manual.
This checklist will need to be supported by:
a scheme health and safety risk assessment (Section B.3)
detailed infiltration assessment (if infiltration components form part of the scheme) (Section B.4)
detailed design checks for the proposed SuDS components (Section B.5)
a construction method statement for the scheme (Section B.6)
a Maintenance Plan for the scheme (Section B.8).
Table B.4 could be used as a checklist by organisations responsible for the approval and adoption of
SuDS to support their assessment of schemes, or it could be used as part of the required submissions
from the developer.

B.4 INFILTRATION ASSESSMENT
he benefits and suitabiit of infitration
The use of infiltration to dispose of surface water runoff has a number of important benefits
It can reduce the volume of runoff and the storage required to control peak rates of runoff discharged
from the site (and thus help deliver important flood risk management criteria).
It can help replenish aquifers local to the site through deep infiltration, and/or act to support local
river base flows and wetland systems via shallow infiltration processes.
It can help support local soil moisture levels and vegetation.
These benefits mean that infiltration is advocated as the first route of disposal of surface water runoff
to be considered when developing runoff management options by many national guidance documents,
including this manual and HM Government (2010). Detailed guidance on infiltration testing and infiltration
system design can be found in Chapter 25.
Infiltration can be used in the following ways
As a destination for the disposal of surface water runoff for design events
Limited infiltration capacity may mean that infiltration is used for small and/or medium events and
then may work in combination with discharge to surface waters for more extreme events.
To help provide Interception for a sustainable drainage system with an outfall to a watercourse
or sewer
Interception is concerned with preventing runoff from the site for the first 5 mm (or other specified
depth) of rainfall for most events (note it is not expected that Interception will necessarily be
delivered for all events, eg when soils are saturated following prolonged heavy rainfall). The delivery
of Interception ensures that the runoff frequency from the site more closely mimics greenfield
characteristics, and constrains the number of potentially polluting discharge events. Interception
does not necessarily need a specific infiltration capacity, but most soils (even capping layer soils on
contaminated sites) should provide some Interception if covered with a layer of topsoil. To deliver
Interception, it should be demonstrated that the system can remove the specified Interception rainfall
depth within hours through the use of evaporation, evapotranspiration and infiltration processes.
There are, however, a number of scenarios where infiltration may not be possible or cannot be relied on
as a complete discharge route for all sies (return periods) of event. These caveats are important and
it should not therefore be interpreted that infiltration must be used at all cost and rather, that infiltration
should be used where conditions allow and where it is safe.
The following considerations should be fully evaluated before determining the extent to which infiltration
can be used on a site:
the infiltration capacity of the soil
the risk of ground instability or subsidence due to infiltration
the risk of slope instability or solifluction as a results of infiltration
the risk of pollution from mobilising existing contaminants on the site
the risk of pollution from infiltrating polluted surface water runoff from the site
the risk of groundwater flooding due to infiltration
the risk of groundwater leakage into the combined sewer owing to promoting infiltration on the site.
Infiltration may be at or near the surface and spread over a wide area (eg basin), or it could be a point
location such as a normal soakaway. Many sites will use normal small soakaways for roof water where
822 Appendix B
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
possible. The issues listed above become more of a risk the more any water is concentrated into a
point discharge. Thus, large-volume deep soakaways pose more of a risk than small shallow basins, for
example.
Preliminary information on whether a site may be suitable for infiltration, or to identify issues that should
be considered, can be obtained from the British Geological Survey (BGS) Infiltration SuDS Map. This
map allows users to determine the:
likely presence of constraints that ought to be considered when planning infiltration SuDS
likely potential for the ground to accept infiltration
likely potential for ground instability when water is infiltrated
likely issues around groundwater quality protection.
The acceptability of infiltration with respect to groundwater protection and system design methods is
presented in Chapters 4 and 26.
B.4.2 The objectives of the checklist
This infiltration assessment checklist is intended to be used by organisations approving the drainage
scheme (drainage approving bodies) to help assess submissions for drainage approval that include
infiltration systems. As discussed above there may be scenarios that preclude infiltration as the main
outfall for surface water. If it can be shown that infiltration is not suitable for the main destination for
surface water from a site (eg because of the presence of contamination that could be mobilised and
could pose a risk to groundwater or other receptors) then completing this checklist is not necessary and
infiltration tests will not be required. On marginal sites where it is not clear whether infiltration is possible
or not, infiltration tests may be necessary to show that infiltration cannot be relied upon as the main outfall
for surface water.
It is intended to facilitate a consistent assessment process and to ensure that designs meet the key
design requirements set out in this manual.
It is also intended to help designers ensure that they have provided all relevant information to the
drainage approving body in their submissions for approval.
The use of infiltration should be approved by a geotechnical engineer or engineering geologist (eg a
registered ground engineer adviser or similar)
on larger sites or sub-catchments ( 1000 m2 draining to an infiltration device)
in areas where there are likely to be issues with the use of infiltration (eg due to potential
solution features)
where the consequences of failure are significant (eg damage to buildings).
This requirement is particularly important where infiltration tests have not been undertaken by a specialist
site investigation company. Normally, a company carrying out site investigations and infiltration tests will
include a geotechnical engineer or engineering geologist, and they can advise of any potential significant
issues and advise on the suitability of infiltration and any constraints that should be applied to a site. This
can be included in the report provided by the specialist company for very little cost.
If infiltration is proposed at conceptual design stage and there are no infiltration test results available,
alternative proposals for discharge should be provided so that in the event that infiltration tests show that
infiltration is not possible, the site can still be effectively drained.
The infiltration checklist can be applied to all sites. However, for lower risk situations, approving
authorities may wish to reduce the extent of the checklist. This will be a decision made by individual
authorities based on their knowledge of local conditions. Such cases could include the following, subject
Appendix B: Checklists
823
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
to there being no significant geotechnical, contamination or groundwater flooding issues in the area in
which the site is located:
less than ten properties with individual soakaways for roof drainage with each soakaway draining
less than 100 m2 of roof area
small car parks or similar areas less than 1000 m2
.
This checklist is designed to be used for sites where infiltration is a significant destination for surface
water. It is not intended to be used for sites where infiltration will only be used to help provide Interception
(eg water leaking from the base of swales or basins). Some of the items discussed may need to be
considered when deciding if any infiltration is acceptable (eg where there are risks of mobilising
contamination in the subsoils).

B.5.9 Ponds and wetlands
This checklist can be used by the organisation approving the drainage scheme (drainage approving body)
to help assess submissions for drainage approval.
This checklist is aimed at providing a consistent assessment process and ensuring that designs meet the
key design requirements set out in Chapter 23. The design guidance in the manual provides details that
support the implementation of this checklist so that designs and compliance assessment can be delivered
effectively. Appropriate section references from the manual are provided in the checklist.
This checklist should form part of a suite of documents required for a submission for drainage approval,
including (but not limited to):
a scheme design assessment
detailed infiltration assessment (where infiltration components are proposed)
a scheme health and safety risk assessment (if required)
a scheme construction method statement
a scheme Maintenance Plan.
It can be used as a checklist by organisations responsible for the approval and adoption of SuDS to
support their assessment of schemes, or it can be used as part of the required submissions from the
developer. It can also help designers ensure that they have provided all relevant information to the
drainage approving body in their submissions for approval.
Minimum design requirements are provided in Table B.20. Where there are variations from these,
justification should be provided and evidence set out that risks relating to safety and/or performance have
been managed appropriately.
The checklist can be used for a single pond/wetlands or groups of similar features with the same characteristics.

B.6 CONSTRUCTION METHOD STATEMENTS AND ASSESSMENT CHECKLISTS
B.6.1 Guidance on construction method statements
Why is a construction method statement such an important part of the drainage submission process?
The purpose of a construction method statement is to:
formalise who is responsible for completing the work
set out the approach, processes and programme proposed for constructing and stabilising the SuDS
(so that those with delivery responsibility understand what is to be done, how and why)
identify any unusual items or methods of working that are required.
Contractors and developers are familiar with preparing construction method statements for a wide variety
of purposes, not least to manage health and safety and contractual risks on construction sites.
In terms of health and safety, the method statement should detail a safe system of work. It should identify
the hazards that may arise during construction and the measures that should be taken to ensure that the
hazards do not pose an unacceptable risk to workers and the public.
Method statements for SuDS are necessary because many people in the construction industry are not
familiar with the specific requirements for constructing SuDS, and some of the requirements are contrary
to accepted practice in some fields (for example, the requirement for a drop from hard surfaces to
grassed areas where water is flowing off an edge is the opposite to normal landscape practice, which is
to raise the turf level above the hard surface).
It is also important to understand the impact of other construction activities on the SuDS (for example,
once permeable sub-base is laid, it cannot be used as a construction route or platform unless it is
protected from siltation and loading damage).
The construction method statement can be used by the drainage adoption body to assess the
constructability of the proposed design, to evaluate the construction implications and to plan the
appropriate construction inspection regime that will enable an assessment that the system has been
constructed in accordance with the design.
What needs to be included?
Every job is different and every method statement should be site specific. Most of the information
included in standard method statements for health and safety and general management of the
construction process will be acceptable, with the addition of information specific to the SuDS. This means
that there will be negligible extra work required to prepare the SuDS construction method statement.
The main requirements for a construction method statement are:
details of the nature of the work to be completed
site plans and full scheme drawings, where these are required to support the method of approach
consents and reinstatement requirements
access points and details
any site-specific ecological issues or features that require protection and/or consideration
any likely water quality issues resulting from the SuDS construction
the proposed strategy for sediment control and site drainage during the construction of the
development, where this impacts on the SuDS proposed for the site it should identify any potential
impacts on the final performance of the drainage system and any necessary protection measures (or
remedial works such as silt removal at the end of construction of the development)
854 Appendix B
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
a detailed programme for construction of the drainage works (including stabilisation and planting of
exposed surfaces); the programme should highlight key points at which inspection is recommended
specific details where the proposed construction processes are unusual, unique or required by a
specific product manufacturer
what plant is required and how it will be used
simple illustrations, where necessary, to aid understanding of what is required
full contact information for:
site manager
the name of the person on site (usually a foreman) who will be responsible for the work
other relevant professional contacts, eg archaeologist, ecologist, drainage approving body,
environmental regulator
emergency contact details.
The contractor or developer should provide the method statement to the drainage approving body
before starting the drainage construction, and the statement should be discussed and agreed
with the contractor at a pre-contract meeting. The information in the method statement should be
communicated to site staff via a toolbox talk which would routinely be required as part of the health
and safety requirements for a site.
There may be a general high-level method statement that deals with, for example, phasing of different
parts of the SuDS. Several more detailed statements that relate to specific work items may also be
provided. Generic method statements should be avoided they should be written for the site in question.
Where to find more information?
Detailed information on the requirements for SuDS construction and method statements is provided in
Chapter 31 and in Woods Ballard et al (2007).
Also, there are numerous method statements on the internet, and the best approach is to read a few of
those to gain an idea of what information is provided, then apply that knowledge to the SuDS method
statement for the particular site.
B.6.2 Construction inspection and assessment
Objectives
The objective of a construction assessment is to verify that the drainage system is constructed in
accordance with the approved design and specification. Verification can be undertaken by the drainage
approving body, by independent consultants employed by the drainage approving body or developer, or
a combination of these. If the verification visits and report are undertaken by a consultant employed by
the developer, there should be a contractual link to the drainage approving body via a warranty from the
consultant, or some other mechanism.
Conflicts of interest should be avoided in the verification process. A contractor, supplier (eg permeable
pavements) or developer certifying their own work or product is considered to be a conflict of interest and
is not good practice. Verification also requires a full understanding of the drainage system for the site,
how it fits in with the overall flood risk strategy and the philosophy underpinning the design. A contractor
employed to install drainage or a supplier of materials or components is not likely to have this level of
understanding of the site. Self-certification of construction is not acceptable.
It is intended that the suggested checklist provided here gives a broad outline of the items that will require
checking. The precise details will vary from scheme to scheme, and the list should be adapted to suit
each site. This will require the removal or addition of items as necessary.
Appendix B: Checklists
855
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Programme and method of approach
Work should not start on site until the drainage approving body has formally approved the drainage
design plans, method statement and specification in writing. Further to this approval being given, the
drainage approving body should then be given at least two weeks’ notice of the proposed start of
construction of the development and for larger sites should be provided with a programme of works.
For smaller sites hours’ notice of any works requiring inspection should be sufficient. The drainage
approving body should be notified immediately, and with sufficient notice, of any significant changes to
the programme. This is to allow the drainage approving body sufficient opportunity to inspect the works.
The construction method statement should detail the specific SuDS construction methods and processes, and
the construction programme, including key points at which inspection is recommended (eg when subsequent
coverage of elements would mean inspection could not then be undertaken without removal of material).
Changes to design during construction
It is inevitable that there will be changes to the design during construction. This is a normal part of
construction. However, it is important that changes are not made without reference to the drainage
approving body/owner and/or the designer. Major changes should be agreed with both the approving
body and the designer before implementing them (major changes are things that can have a significant
impact on the overall operation and maintenance of the SuDS, eg changing a pond to a basin). Minor
changes should be agreed with the designer, and the changes and agreement recorded for inclusion in
the verification report (see below).
erifiation reort
A verification report should be prepared at the end of construction by the party who has carried out the
inspection visits. This should confirm if the drainage system has been constructed in accordance with
the approved design. It should identify any changes that have been made to the design and the reasons
for those changes, together with confirmation of any likely impact on the performance of the system (if
an adverse impact is expected then necessary remedial works should be specified). Evidence of the
agreement of the drainage approving body and/or designer to the changes should be included.
The verification visit reports should indicate any defects in construction and follow up on any remedial
works that are necessary to confirm that they have been completed.
The format of the report will be site specific, but as a minimum it will be expected to include the following
photographs of excavations, confirmation of soil conditions, confirmation of levels, profiles and
General earthworks
photographs and full manufacturers’ details (if appropriate) of inlets, outlets and any control
structures associated with any feature to be adopted
confirmation of topsoil sources with appropriate certificates
full planting lists and confirmation of plant sources, planting method statement and initial
maintenance regime
confirmation of subsoil and topsoil depths
confirmation of gravel fill/sub-base specification and sources, installation method statement of filter
drains/permeable pavements
confirmation of source and test certificates for membrane liners if used (Membranes shall have
welded joints and shall be inspected and the joints tested after installation. Records of the tests shall
be provided. Integrity tests may be necessary if the membrane performance is critical.)
photographs of the feature before and after planting
full as-constructed drawings and a topographical survey of the as-constructed system
confirmation of initial maintenance regimes.

B.7 CONSTRUCTION SPECIFICATION
The common construction specifications are
Civil Engineering Specification for the Water Industry (CESWI) (WRc, 2011)
National Building Specification (NBS)
Specification for Highway Works (SHW) (HA, 2005)
None of these currently include specific clauses for SuDS construction. However, they do contain clauses
for most of the common construction activities and materials used in SuDS, or provision for including them.
The different items will be found in different parts of each of the standard specifications, but this is not
unusual for any item of construction (eg a car park surface and associated drainage would call upon HA
(2009b, 2009c, 2009d).
Table B.23 summarises some of the features of the different specifications.

Tolerances
The sides slopes of the swale should have a longitudinal and transverse tolerance of 10 mm in m
to promote sheet flow from the drained surface down the slope to prevent erosion occurring.
Contractor design elements
The wet well pumping station at end of swale is to be designed by the contractor in accordance with
WRc (2011) including chamber, inlet and outlet, pumps and controls. The pumps provided are to
provide a capacity of at least 9 l/s with a duty and standby pump provided.
Provision is to be made in the pumping station to add lime dosing equipment at a later date if
required.
The wet well should be designed so that it traps and prevents floating debris (sawdust and
woodchip) from entering the pumps and a means of removing the debris provided.
B.8 MAINTENANCE PLAN AND CHECKLIST
B.8.1 Why is a Maintenance Plan needed?
The purpose of a Maintenance Plan is to ensure that all those involved in the maintenance and operation
of the SuDS system understand its functionality and maintenance requirements in terms of supporting
long-term performance to the design criteria to which it was designed.
A Maintenance Plan delivered as part of a drainage submission
confirms that the designer has taken maintenance into account within the design
demonstrates the competence of the designer
provides a guide to the adoption team as to what the maintenance requirements of the system are
and how they can be met most efficiently
provides a basis for costing long-term maintenance budgets (and commuted sums, if required)
provides a working document for use on site
details procedures for dealing with emergency spillages, vandalism etc it should include the local
environmental regulator telephone number, which should be called in case of spillages or other
pollution incidents.
The Maintenance Plan for the drainage system should be designed in co-operation with the adopting
organisation, and the information therein should be presented and discussed verbally with all those
involved in inspecting and maintaining the drainage systems.
B.8.2 What should a Maintenance Plan include?
The SuDS Maintenance Plan should cover and clarify the following issues
a description of the site – concentrating on describing how the drainage system works in practice
and what it is trying to achieve. This is likely to include flow routes, sub-catchments, SuDS
components, flow control features and outfall arrangements. It should also explain the visual
and biodiversity aspects of a scheme, as these can easily be compromised by inappropriate
maintenance.
a plan of the site that identifies runoff sub-catchments, SuDS components, critical water levels,
control structures, flow routes (including exceedance routing) and outfalls
Appendix B: Checklists
865
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
a plan clearly showing the extent of the adopted area along with easements and rights of way for
access to carry out maintenance. If other parties are responsible for different parts of a scheme, this
should be clearly shown on the plan.
the access that is required to each surface water management component for maintenance
purposes and a plan for the safe and sustainable removal and disposal of waste periodically arising
from the drainage system
a review of the work to be undertaken, based on regular day-to-day maintenance, occasional tasks
and remedial work. Details of the likely maintenance requirements for each SuDS element are
provided in this Manual. Maintenance requirements for proprietary systems should be provided by
the manufacturer or supplier.
the maintenance specification detailing the materials to be used and the standard of work required.
A specification should describe how the work should be carried out and should contain clauses
giving general instructions to the maintenance contractor.
the maintenance schedule of work – itemising the tasks to be undertaken and the frequency at
which they should be performed so that an acceptable long-term performance standard is secured.
This schedule can then be priced and checked on site, and it can form the basis of an inspection
log where appropriate. The schedule should be a living document because it may change, where
inspections advise changes to the scheme maintenance requirements.
contact sheet and any extra guidance notes – eg action plan for dealing with accidental spillages
photographic records of the inspections. This can pick up long-term changes that might not be
apparent on a single visit, especially where inspections are carried out by different members of staff.
Note: An example of a Maintenance Plan is available in Box B.2.
B.8.3 Maintenance inspection checklist
This checklist is a generic list that can be added to, or have items removed from it, to suit a particular site.
The exact content of the checklist will depend on the combination of different SuDS components used in
a scheme. Checklists should be selected based on the combination of elements in the drainage system to
provide a bespoke inspection report.
The objective of this checklist is to
confirm that appropriate routine maintenance of the system is being undertaken
confirm that the system is continuing to operate effectively
identify any remedial works required
provide a consistent record of the condition and performance of the system.
It is not a checklist of maintenance items, which is covered in Chapters 11 to 23 of this manual
(Table B.24). It is a checklist to facilitate consistent inspection of the condition of the system. It can
be used by any organisation responsible for the long-term maintenance of the SuDS system as a
recording process, or by a subcontracted organisation as part of their client reporting procedures.
Inspections should comply with all relevant health and safety legislation (The Management of Health and
Safety at Work Regulations 1999) including the development of risk assessments for working close to or
in water.
Inspections should ideally be carried out monthly (and no less than three-monthly), at the same time as
other routine maintenance activities.

Example SuDS Maintenance Plan for Robinswood Primary School
An introduction to sustainable drainage systems or SuDS
SuDS are a new environmentally friendly approach to managing rainfall that uses landscape
features to deal with surface water. SuDS aim to:
control the flow, volume and frequency of water leaving a development area
prevent pollution by intercepting silt and cleaning runoff from hard surfaces
provide attractive surroundings for the community
create opportunities for wildlife.
SuDS at Robinswood Primary School and Matson Park
The SuDS are designed to prevent flooding of Robinswood Primary School and to control the flow of
water from springs in Matson Park using attractive landscape features.
A low bank has been constructed in the park as a dam when water flows down the route of an
old ditch during heavy rain.
The everyday flow from springs above the path in the park has been directed along a new
stream in the park, which keeps a new wildlife pond full of water but also allows it to soak into
the ground or flow onward to a controlled outfall into the school grounds.
The controlled outfall into the school grounds allows heavy rainfall to leave the park slowly and
make its way through green space above the school playing field.
Exceptional storms or prolonged heavy rain can overflow from the park across a grass weir
on the bank into the environment space at the top of the playing field retained by a low bank
running along the contour to the old oak tree.
The school wildlife pond, with a toddler fence around it, gives children in the school an
opportunity to learn about animals and plants that live in water and to understand how the SuDS
control system works.
Water will slowly soak into the ground as it travels along the SuDS system, but in exceptional
storms some water may overflow down the side of the playing field towards the road as it did in
the past but without going through the school first.
Managing the SuDS
The SuDS at Robinswood Primary School have been designed for easy maintenance to comprise
regular day-to-day care litter collection, grass cutting and checking the inlets and outlets
where water enters or leaves a SuDS feature
occasional tasks managing pond vegetation and removing any silt that builds up in the
SuDS features
remedial work – repairing damage where necessary.

Matson Park SuDS management
The SuDS sequence begins where the springs emerge above the path, near the park entrance from
Underhill Road, and take a changed route under a new bridge to form a stream in the park.
Action:
Strim or mow grass where the springs emerge and allow vegetation to grow to at least 100 mm
or to full height annually in the low flow channel or stream bed.
The new stream carries water to the first wildlife pond (Pond 1 see site plan).
Action:
Mow the path verge and grass up to the stream as current practice by GCC.
Cut stream vegetation annually in SeptemberNovember, removing cuttings to a wildlife pile or
from site.
Allow grass beyond the stream to develop as meadow and cut at 100 mm September
November removing cuttings to a wildlife pile or from site.
The wildlife pond will develop wetland vegetation round the edge with reasonably short grass
towards the park side to allow people to look at the water.
Longer meadow grass on the far side of the pond and beyond the stream will provide a home for
wildlife and an opportunity for creative play.
Action:
Mow the path verge and grass up to the stream and pond edge from park side as current
practice by GCC.
Cut meadow grass beyond stream at 100 mm SeptemberNovember removing cuttings to a
wildlife pile or from site.

Monitor how the pond edge develops, and cut 0 of vegetation at 100 mm each year during
SeptemberNovember, if required, removing cuttings to wildlife piles or from site.
Occasionally remove pond vegetation, if it spreads across the pond, by hand clearing, raking or
machine clearance, using a 1 tonne tracked vehicle, with cuttings removed to wildlife piles or
from site.
Check the outlet from the pond and the inlet on the other side of the bank are clear.
The stream flows onward from the pond through grass to a micropool, before it leaves the park
through a final outlet into the school grounds environment space at the top of the playing field.
There is a grass overflow weir over the bank down to the school fence which should be cut annually
to ensure that erosion does not occur. Brambles should be allowed to re-colonise the base of the
bank on the school side for security reasons.
Action:
Mow path verge and grass to the stream from the park side as current practice by GCC.
Cut meadow grass beyond stream at 100 mm SeptemberNovember removing cuttings to a
wildlife pile or from site.
Cut micropool vegetation annually SeptemberNovember, if required, removing cuttings to a
wildlife pile or from site.
Cut overflow weir as meadow grass at 100 mm SeptemberNovember removing cuttings to a
wildlife pile or from site.
Robinswood Primary School SuDS management
Water from the Matson Park flows slowly through the bank, or overflows over a grass weir in
exceptional rainfall. The water arrives on the school site through the fence onto a stone-filled basket
channel flowing along a grass swale to the second wildlife pond and environment space (Pond 2
see site plan).
Action:
Strim or mow grass around stone-filled basket channel and along the swale to the pond at 100
mm with grass at maximum height 150 mm.
The school wildlife pond will develop a wetland edge along the 1 m wide wet ledge before rising up
to a flat dry ledge (or bench) provided for safety.
Action:
Allow grass beyond the pond and away from the school side to develop as meadow and cut at
100 mm in SeptemberNovember removing cuttings to a wildlife pile on site.
On the school side, cut the grass regularly at 100 mm with grass at maximum height 150 mm for
access.
Monitor pond vegetation and cut 0 of edge at 100 mm each year, if necessary, during
SeptemberNovember, removing cuttings to wildlife piles.
Occasionally remove pond vegetation if it spreads across the pond by hand clearing or raking
being careful not to damage the pond liner.
The water leaves the pond under a small bridge into a swale mae flowing to a flat activity area.
Water leaves the southern end of the environment space through an outlet in the bank with a
micropool in front of it.

SuDS scheme checklist
SuDS schemes include landscape features and control structures to manage runoff as it flows to site
outfalls. The following lists the SuDS components and extra features which may be found on a site.
Filter strips are grass verges that allow runoff to flow through vegetation to a swale, wetland,
infiltration area or other SuDS component.
Swales are linear, flat-bottomed grassed or vegetated channels that convey water from one
place to another. They can also store water and allow it to soak into the ground.
Underdrained swales are stone-filled trenches with a perforated pipe in the bottom covered by
engineered sandy soil and turf. These intercept dirty water and allow it to soak into the ground
or lead it to a water storage feature.
Filter drains clean, store and convey water to another feature or allow it to soak into the ground.
They are stone-filled trenches, sometimes with a perforated pipe in the bottom. These may be
enlarged to treat dirty water, as treatment trenches, or increase soakage into the ground, as
infiltration trenches.
Permeable surfaces are permeable block paving, porous asphalt, gravel or free-draining soils
that allow rain to percolate through the surface into underlying drainage layers. They should be
protected from silt, sand, compost, mulch etc.
Infiltration asins trenes soaaays and most of the preceding SuDS features allow
water to soak into the ground.
Basins, ponds and wetlands are depressions in the ground where water is stored and treated.
Water levels rise after rain and then drop to the normal level as the excess soaks into the
ground or is released slowly to a watercourse or drain. Some water may be held back as a pond
for final treatment, amenity or wildlife interest.
Bioretention areas are planted areas with engineered topsoil over drainage layers that allow
water to soak into the ground.

Example SuDS Maintenance Plan for Robinswood Primary School
Green roofs are planted with sedum or other plant material. They clean and absorb water
allowing it to evaporate. Excess water is drained from the roof to other SuDS features.
Inlet and outlets structures are often conveyance pipes protected with mesh guards. They
should be free from obstruction at all times to allow free flow through the SuDS.
SuDS o ontrol strutures are usually small orifices in control chamber, slots or V-notches
in weirs. They are usually near the surface, so are accessible and easy to maintain. They may
be in baskets, in small chambers or in the open.
Inspection chambers and rodding eyes are used on bends or where pipes come together.
They allow cleaning of the system if necessary.
eros can be below ground through gratings and chambers or over grass weirs in the
open. They should be kept clear at all times to protect areas from flooding.
Flood routes (exceedance routes) allow water volumes exceeding the capacity of the SuDS
system to escape from the site without causing damage to property. This route should be clear
of obstructions at all times.
SuDS design usually avoids use of below-ground structures such as gully pots, oil separators and
other sumps, which are a wildlife haard, often ineffective and expensive to maintain. SuDS design
also reduces pipework, manholes and interceptors. However, water may be conveyed in surface
features such as rills and channels, with changes in level managed in spouts or cascades. These
hard landscape features require standard landscape maintenance.

Flood routes (exceedance routes) allow water volumes that exceed the capacity of the SuDS
system to pass through or round the site without causing damage to property. These routes
should be clear of obstructions at all times.

Spillage – emergency action
Most spillages on development sites are of compounds that do not pose a serious risk to the environment
if they enter the drainage in a slow and controlled manner with
time available for natural breakdown in a treatment system.
Therefore, small spillages of oil, milk or other known organic
substances should be removed where possible using soak mats
as recommended by the Environment Agency, with residual
spillage allowed to bioremediate in the drainage system.
In the event of a serious spillage, either by volume or of
unknown or toxic compounds, then isolate the spillage with
soil, turf or fabric and block outlet pipes from chamber(s)
downstream of the spillage with a bung(s). (A bung for
blocking pipes may be made by wrapping soil or turf in a
plastic sheet or closely woven fabric.)

B.9 ADOPTION HANDOVER CHECKLIST
The objective of this checklist is to ensure that
the organisation approving the drainage scheme (drainage approving body) has all the necessary
design and other information to allow it to effectively manage the SuDS component or scheme
the SuDS component or scheme is in an acceptable condition for adoption and will not pose a
maintenance or other liability due to poor quality construction or unauthorised changes to the design.
At adoption handover stage, the design should already be approved, and functionality of the SuDS
components should not be called into question unless it is the direct result of poor construction or
unauthorised changes to the design. The system should have been constructed to the tolerances
stated in the approved design and specification (or to accepted industry tolerances such as those
stated in the SHW (HA, 2005) in relation to earthworks and road pavement construction or BS 75-
2005A12009 for block paving construction). If the
system is constructed outside the specified tolerances
it may require an assessment of the as-constructed
tolerances to determine whether or not it will perform
as required.
The adoption handover inspection should be carried
out at the end of the 12 month defects liability period
(or other specified period). It should supplement the
final construction inspection and is not a replacement
for the construction inspections. The process should
be as shown in Figure B.2.
It is likely that phased completion of parts of a SuDS
scheme will be necessary on larger systems. The
complete scheme may not be delivered until the total
build-out is completed (this could take 10 years in
some cases). However, portions of the scheme for
specific sub-catchments will be delivered and will be
self-sustaining in their own right. Adopting bodies
should adapt the checklist and have procedures in
place to allow for this scenario. Figure B.2 Adoption process

Design example:
Rosetree Estate
This design example is based on a hypothetical site, developed to
demonstrate:
1 the design process (Chapter 7)
2 the detailed hydraulic and treatment design of individual components
(Chapters 11–23).
It does not cover landscape works, amenity or biodiversity design,
construction programming and processes costs and benefits
or operation and maintenance requirements, health and safety,
community engagement etc. It does not include appraisal of different
design options or the evaluation of alternative SuDS components in
delivering the required design criteria. The site layout and features have
been developed specifically to allow the incorporation of a range of
preselected SuDS components and it does not purport to be a realistic
development layout.
The example works through the conceptual design of the scheme to
meet the design criteria, as presented in this manual, and sizing of a
number of representative SuDS components. It does not cover detailed
scheme design or component detailing.
C.1 SITE DESCRIPTION
Rosetree Estate is a hypothetical 1 ha greenfield development site in central England,
with proposals agreed for mixed use development, including
A medium-density residential development
B shopping area including a civic street
C large supermarket site
D light industrial area including a factory and a lorry park
E further development area for which there are no current development proposals.
The site will be developed in phases with surface water managed at the sub-catchment level
as far as possible. A strategic site drainage system will collect runoff from sub-catchments and
local surfaces, and convey it to the River Springbourne to the south of the site.
This design example follows the process set out in Chapter 7.
C.2 STAGE 1: STRATEGIC SURFACE WATER MANAGEMENT
OBJECTIVES
Pre-application discussions have occurred between the developer and the local planning
authority, and an Environmental Impact Assessment and Flood Risk Assessment (FRA)
have been undertaken for the development as a whole. Together with initial consultations
with the environmental regulator and local community associations, the strategic site
surface water management objectives listed in Table C.1 have been agreed.
Appendix C: Design example
889
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
TABLE
C.1
Strategic surface water management objectives
Delivery area Strategic objective
Water resource
There are insufficient drivers for residential rainwater harvesting systems. The site is not
in an area of water stress and there are good infiltration opportunities for much of the site,
which provides a more cost-effective means of managing runoff volumes.
The supermarket chain with the right to development on this site has a policy of using rainwater
harvesting for all stores and is keen to use the system to manage surface water from the roof to
the maximum extent possible.
Flood risk
Rates and volumes of surface water discharge from the site to be controlled to greenfield
values, as per the water quantity design standards set out in Section 3.3.
The FRA requires that there is no encroachment of the development into the existing one
river floodplain. Roads and the surface water management system are acceptable within
Flood one 2. The discharge from the SuDS to the River Springbourne will, of necessity,
have to be constructed within the one floodplain.
Water quality The River Springbourne at the site is a sensitive water body due to a downstream drinking
water abstraction point. Appropriate treatment of surface water discharges will be required.
Amenity
For providing appropriate amenity value in the SuDS design, opportunities include
a “green” civic street – where planting is a feature of the community space and retail
environment and can be incorporated in the SuDS design
a landscaped parkland area that offers amenity and recreational value, where water is
a feature and again can be incorporated in the SuDS design.
Habitat and
biodiversity
The local biodiversity strategy has identified the need for
more trees to support specified bird species
wetland areas to replace previous local wetland areas that have been lost, and to
enhance and protect amphibian populations.
There are habitat corridors that link to the site to the north, and the provision of a habitat link
from north to south across the site is important. All of these objectives can be incorporated
into the SuDS design.
Climate resilience
The development is in a low density suburban environment. Urban cooling is not, therefore
a key driver. However, strategic objectives for water resources, flood risk, habitat and
biodiversity will all contribute to climate resilience.
Approval and
adoption
The local planning authority will be the approving body for the surface water management
system, and will approve the scheme against a set of locally agreed standards (that match
those set out in this manual).
The local sewerage undertaker has agreed to adopt and maintain the strategic drainage
components that lie within public open space, including both surface components and
subsurface pipework. The drainage within the commercial and industrial plots will be owned
and maintained by the relevant site owners. The soakaways in private gardens will be the
responsibility of the property owner.
C.3 STAGE 2: CONCEPTUAL DESIGN
Step 1 Site and development characterisation
Following the guidance set out in Section 7.5.1, the characteristics set out in Tables C.2 and C.3 relating
to surface water management were established for the site and the development respectively. The layout
of the site and development are illustrated in Figures C.1 and C.2 respectively.
890 Appendix C
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
TABLE
C.2
Site characterisation outcomes
Site topography The area comprises gently sloping terrain towards the south-east of the site.
istin o
routes and
discharge points
The site has not been previously developed, so the only unnatural preferential flow routes
are those formed by farming patterns.
There was, historically, a small ditch running centrally through the site from north to south.
Potential for
infiltration
The east of the site overlies low permeability clay soils where maximum groundwater levels
are within 1 m of the ground surface. Infiltration will be limited in this area.
The soils to the west of the site are sandier and more permeable and groundwater levels are
lower. There are opportunities for infiltration in this area.
The ground to the north of the site is on the edge of a water supply borehole source
protection one (SP1) which is a separate groundwater body. Groundwater in this area
lies approximately 3 m from the surface and is overlain by relatively low permeability silty
clayey sand.
The site is greenfield and there is no known contamination of the underlying soils in or
adjacent to this area.
Potential for
surfae ater
discharge
The river supports medium/good water quality. It is classed as sensitive at this location,
because of a water supply abstraction point 250 m downstream. Surface water can be
discharged to the river providing it has been adequately treated.
Site oo riss
There is an area of floodplain adjacent to the river that encroaches on the development site.
Water levels during periods of flooding could pose a risk to the free discharge from the
drainage system. This would need to be allowed for in the detailed design of the system.
There are no known existing groundwater, coastal or pluvial flood risks on or adjacent to the site.
Existing site land
use The only use of the site before the proposed development was agricultural.
Existing site
infrastructure There are no existing services or other surface or buried infrastructure on the site.
Existing soils The existing topsoil and subsoil are suitable for use in the SuDS components.
Local habitats
and biodiversity
The local biodiversity strategy has identified that the site forms part of a habitat corridor
running northsouth and that, in general, this region has suffered from a loss of tree
species and wetland areas, which has been damaging from an ecosystem/habitat
perspective.
Local landscape
an tonsae
The area is a small agricultural plot within a principally suburban zone. The level of
urbanisation intensifies downstream of this site. The local townscape character is mixed but
primarily contemporary.

roads. There is likely to be some reprofiling of the site slopes to facilitate construction of the
supermarket and industrial areas. The residential and civic street areas will be designed on
a gentle slope. The natural drainage patterns on the site have influenced the sub-catchment
definition, allowing storage to be provided along the contours to make maximum use of the
storage availability across the site.
The five sub-catchments reflect different land uses, facilitating the clustering of land use
types for pollution management purposes.
The residential area will include houses at densities of 30–40 houses per hectare with
shared parking areas.
The civic street will be lined with shops with flats above. Open space will be provided at
street level for amenity and retail purposes.
To the south-west of the development, closer to the river, the land has been designated as
an area of public open space.

ris manaement
strategy
SuDS components can lie within Flood one 2, but the combined probability of fluvial and
site flooding events will need consideration when checking the impact of flooding on the
functionality of the system. SuDS components that are conveying water to the river for
discharge can lie in Flood one .
Proposed site
infrastructure
The surface water management system will need to be integrated with the network of
proposed services and planned road infrastructure.
Proposed
building use,
style an form
The civic street requires amenity and biodiversity enhancement with vegetated features
and trees.
Amenity sports pitches could be used to store volumes of floodwater during extreme events.
A green corridor northsouth through the site could add significant amenity and biodiversity
value and should be used to convey surface water where possible.

Step 2 Establish SuDS design criteria
A suite of design criteria have been established for the scheme in Table C.4 that take account of:
the design criteria described in Chapters 3–6 of this manual
the strategic surface water management objectives (Table C.1)
the opportunities, constraints and challenges identified by the site and development characterisation
process (Tables C.2 and C.3)
the guidance set out in Chapters 8–10 of this manual.
894 Appendix C
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
TABLE
C.4
SuDS design criteria for the site
Delivery of design criteria
Water quantity
1 Use rainwater harvesting systems where suitable drivers exist (likely to be for the
supermarket development only).
2 Control peak runoff rates from the site for the critical 1:100 year event (to meet water
quantity standard 2b) using appropriate sub-catchment and strategic system flow
controls.
3 Control runoff volumes from the site for an appropriate 1:100 year event (to meet water
quantity standard 1b) using rainwater harvesting, infiltration and Long-Term Storage in
amenity sports pitch areas.
Discharge to groundwater and surface waters, not sewers.
4 Control peak runoff rates from the site for the critical 1:1 year return period event (to
meet water quantity standard 2a) from strategic amenity pond discharge to river.
5 Deliver Interception for all hard surfaces on the site (to meet water quantity standard 1a).
6 Recreate the ditch running from north to south through the site as a green corridor for
the management of surface water.
7 Ensure that the selected SuDS components drain sufficiently quickly so that the system
is prepared for managing further rainfall.
8 Ensure that all surface water is retained within the SuDS components for events up to
the critical 1:30 year event and contained within appropriate exceedance routes and
storage areas up to the critical 1100 year event, with 00 mm freeboard to points of
potential entry to buildings (to meet water quantity standards a and b), and to include
relevant climate change and urban creep allowances.
Water quality
1 Ensure industrial areas have appropriate pollution control operational processes in
place to minimise the risk of serious pollution events occurring.
2 Provide treatment of surface water runoff to meet the requirements of water quality
standard 2.
3 Ensure that the impact of periodic extended wet and dry periods (potentially more likely
under climate change scenarios) would not invalidate treatment performance. Use
drought tolerant grasses and shrubs for filter strips, swales, bioretention areas. Ensure
suitable supply of water for tree pits. Check treatment if wetland and pond dry out.
menity
1 Integrate car parking, recreational and amenity space, identified green corridors and
public open space areas with the surface water management system.
2 Use water to support vegetation to enhance civic space, the road environment and
public open space.
3 Keep side slopes to accessible water features, swales and detention basins shallow,
easily accessible and easy to maintain.
4 Use trees to provide shade in civic street.
5 Keep water on or at the surface where practical.
6 Incorporate rain play features into playground and use wetlands as educational wildlife
resource.
Biodiversity
1 Recreate historic ditch and wetland systems.
2 Enhance tree numbers.
3 Contribute to habitat connectivity through green north–south corridor and link to river
floodplain.
4 Use a range of wet or ephemeral (temporarily wet and dry) SuDS components to
encourage more diverse and resilient ecosystems.
Appendix C: Design example
895
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Step 3 Identify feasible points of discharge
Northern and eastern parts of the site are unlikely to be suitable for infiltration of significant volumes
of runoff due to the constraints set out in Table C.2. The western areas are potentially suitable for
infiltration, so discharge to groundwater would be the preferred destination for runoff in this area. There
are no nearby surface water sewers.
Following the discharge prioritisation described in Section 3.2.3, the point of discharge of all runoff
that cannot be infiltrated will be to the adjacent watercourse (the River Springbourne), provided the
appropriate controls and treatment are put in place before discharge.
Ste Define surfae ater subathments and o routes
The surface water sub-catchments are based around the different land use areas, separated by
distributor roads. The flow routes follow the natural drainage paths on the site, re-creating the north
south ditch through the middle of the site and keeping the main eastwest flow routes along the road
networks (Figure C.3). This allows storage to be provided along the contours to make maximum use of
the storage availability across the site.
Figure C. Main flow routes and discharge points
Step 5 Select SuDS components for the Management Train
The strategic site SuDS components (the central swale conveyance route and the pond/wetland
attenuation feature just outside the floodplain of the River Springbourne) should be constructed in
advance of any development on the site. Any sub-catchment detention basins should be implemented
as part of the site construction surface water management system – managing construction runoff and
trapping sediment loads and associated pollution.

SuDS component selection for sub-catchment areas AD are described below, taking representative
areas of each to demonstrate the proposed solutions, that are then sied in Section C.4.2.
Residential development (A)
This development area lies over soils suitable for infiltration. It is, therefore, proposed to drain roof areas
to individual property soakaways and parking and road areas to concrete block permeable pavement
(from which sub-base infiltration is allowed).

Civic street (B)
This development area lies over soils suitable for infiltration, though the proximity of buildings, street
infrastructure and underlying services means that careful design is required to minimise any risk of
adverse effects on the ground below nearby structures. It is proposed to drain roofs and pavement areas
to linked tree pits (the trees providing shade and structure to the street), and the roads to bioretention
areas (providing zones of enhanced amenity value within the urban space). The bioretention areas will
need to be divided with check dams, owing to the slope, and will be used to delineate parking spaces and
pedestrian crossing points.

Supermarket (C)
This supermarket development area lies over soils suitable for infiltration, though partly on a one
identified as a source protection one (SP1). There are only small areas of landscaping because
maximum allocations of roof and car parking are required by the supermarket.
898 Appendix C
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
The drainage system for the site will need to manage the runoff from the following areas:
the large roof
an extensive car park
a delivery area where lorries park while unloading
an access road within the parking area
The supermarket has a rainwater harvesting policy, so all roof water is, where practicable, to be drained
to a rainwater harvesting system, and the operators are keen to add extra storage to this system to
provide surface water management benefits. Any overflow from the rainwater harvesting system can be
discharged to the ground as the risk is very low and sediment removal will already have occurred. (This
was agreed with the environmental regulator as part of the design process.)
The car park could be drained using surface channel systems to bioretention areas and landscaped
swales at the edge of the site, with attenuation storage provided in geocellular tanks. An alternative
option is to use a permeable pavement system with underlying storage. In this case, permeable paving
was the preferred option owing to the need to maximise car parking space. However, the delivery area
will drain to a lined detention basin on the perimeter of the site via a proprietary treatment system. (There
was not sufficient space to include a vegetated, surface treatment system here, but an extra component
was required to remove excess sediments and hydrocarbons to ensure that the quality of water in the
basin was appropriate for an amenity feature for the store). The road areas will drain onto the permeable
pavement surface.
Due to the underlying SP1, infiltration of the car park runoff was not considered to be acceptable without
an extra treatment component before discharge. Therefore a liner is proposed and assessments of risks
to groundwater are not required.

Industrial area (D)
This area lies over low permeability soils (infiltration rate of the order of 1 106 m/s), so infiltration is not
viable as a disposal method.
Amenity is not a key driver for this sub-catchment, but vegetated areas will add economic value to the
site, and contribute to biodiversity, while delivering water quantity and water quality criteria.
The large roof area will require significant attenuation, which can be provided cost-effectively in
attenuation tanks that lie beneath the car park area.
The hard external surface for the factory will require surface treatment components, so that spills or other
unexpectedly high pollutant loads can be identified and cleaned up easily. An underdrained swale against
the boundary of the site will provide treatment, conveyance and some storage, followed by a small
wetland zone.
The adjacent lorry park will also require surface-based treatment, but safety concerns over lorry
turning and open channels in this area means that a filter strip and filter drain around the edges are the
preferred options.

Step 6 Optimise the Management Train
The scheme is reviewed against the design criteria, and notes added for use in detailed design to
ensure that benefits are maximised and suitable calculations and checks are undertaken, including
an assessment that the space required for the proposed components is available on the site, and that
components are located at a suitable distance from building footprints.
902 Appendix C
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Step 7 The conceptual design
Figure C.4 shows the conceptual SuDS design for the site.
Figure C. Overview of proposed SuDS components and Management Train
C.4 STAGE 3: OUTLINE DESIGN
C.4.1 Size SuDS components at site scale
Step 1 Estimate allowable peak site discharge rates
Rosetree Estate is a 1 ha greenfield development site. The standard that is set for the site is that peak flow
rates for the 11 year and 1100 year events should be controlled to the equivalent for the greenfield site.
The hydrological characteristics of the region are:
SAAR (mm) 556
SOIL factor 0.37
Hydrometric area 5
Guidance set out in Chapter 24 should be followed for runoff rate estimation. Greenfield runoff rates can
be estimated using FEH methods (Section 24.3.1). However, for simplicity, they are estimated here using
the IH12 equation (Section 24.3.2) as follows:
Appendix C: Design example
903
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
As shown in Equation 24.3 (Section 24.3.2), since the site is less than 50 ha, the formula should be
applied for 50 ha and the result factored based on the ratio of areas.
= 0.11 m3/s
= 110 l/s for 50 ha site
= 110/50
= 2.2 l/s/ha
Although the whole site measures 1.1 ha, there is 2. ha of land adjacent to the floodplain which will be
parkland and will drain directly to the river at greenfield rates without the need for storage. Therefore the
area to be considered in these calculations is 31.1 ha – 2.4 ha = 28.7 ha.
The total allowable QBAR from the site is therefore: 2.2 × 28.7 = 63 l/s.
To get the 11 and 1100 year allowable peak flow rates, the growth curve factors from Table 24.2 are used:
1 year factor = 0.87
30 year factor = 2.55
100 year factor = 3.56
Greenfield limiting discharge rates for the site are therefore as given in Table C.9.

1 year 55 0.00019
30 year 161 0.00056
100 year 224 0.00078
These discharge limits will be required at detailed design stage, to sie the flow control components for
each sub-catchment and from the amenity attenuation pond.
Step 2 Estimate whole site attenuation storage volumes
There are two methods of undertaking preliminary assessments of the attenuation storage volumes
required for a site (Section 24.9.4). For simplicity, the Kellagher (201) approximate approach is used here.

Using the catchment characteristics and design assumptions stated in Table C.10, this outputs the

This includes a climate change allowance.

CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Assuming sub-catchments A, B and roof of C do not require volume control as sufficient volume control is
delivered via infiltration and rainwater harvesting, the area requiring volume control is reduced by 11.9 ha
(6.5 ha area A + 4.5 ha area B and 0.9 ha roof area C) to 16.8 ha.
Therefore the remaining LTS required 5569 x 16. / 2.7 260 m3
Remove Interception for all of the remaining impervious areas for which volume control is not provided, ie
area C (excluding roof area) + area D + area E + roads = 12.4 ha
Interception volume = 5 mm x 12.4 ha = 620 m3
Therefore required LTS 260 620 260 m3
= 8800 m2 @ 0.3 m depth
(Note a football pitch is approximately the same area, so this could be used to store the extra volume.)
There is no need for a climate change allowance when comparing runoff volumes.

The same approach as Step 1 is undertaken for each of the sub-catchments to estimate peak greenfield
runoff rates from each of the areas, in order that sub-catchment attenuation can be implemented where
possible (Table C.11). This ensures that the space on the site is used most effectively.

Note
Greenfield runoff rates could be evaluated using individual sub-catchment hydrological
characteristics (where there are significant differences in levels of permeability across
the site) to optimise the design at detailed design stage, but unit site rates are more likely
to be adopted at conceptual design stage.
Ste Subathment storae oume estimates
An estimate of the attenuation storage likely to be required for each sub-catchment (provided either within
that sub-catchment or in downstream components) is undertaken by factoring the site attenuation storage
estimate by the sub-catchment areas (Table C.12).
It is estimated that these storage volumes can be provided within the proposed components, within the
space available for the development.
Any storage not provided at sub-catchment level will need to be incorporated into the downstream
amenity pond.

Initial assessments of flow control points and exceedance flow routes are undertaken for the purposes of
initial detailed design calculations (Figure C.5). These will require confirmation during design optimisation
(normally done using a hydraulic simulation model for a development of this sie and complexity), which is
not detailed here.

C.5 STAGE 4: DETAILED DESIGN
The critical duration is the length of rainfall event that results in the greatest flow rate, flood volume or
flood level (depending on the purpose of the analysis) at a particular location. The critical duration will
probably be different at different points in the drainage system, with different SuDS components having
different critical durations. The complexity of the site means that it would require detailed modelling to
find the critical duration rainfall event for each of the components. Rainwater harvesting systems and
infiltration systems will have very different critical duration events from swales or detention basins, and
this cannot be easily established using simple hand calculations.
Some representative flow rates and volumes have therefore been assumed in order to demonstrate the
technical design of each of the components.
C.5.1 Residential development (A)
A1 Residential soakaway
This example follows the design method for infiltration systems that is described in Chapter 25.
A geocellular soakaway system is proposed for the individual house soakaways that allows infiltration
from both the vertical sides and the base. Therefore the procedure in Equation 25.5 for 3D systems
is used (Section 25.6.2). The design could also be undertaken using commercially available drainage
design software. The design is for a 110 year rainfall event. Each soakaway will be required to drain a
roof area of 150 m2 (ie the roof of a single house).
Ste stimate infitration rate
A site investigation was carried out across the residential development area in Area A to confirm
the conceptual design assumption that there were silty sands beneath the area that would be
suitable for infiltration.
The investigation included infiltration tests that followed the guidance in BRE (1991) (Section 25.3). The
tests were spread evenly over the residential area and were carried out at a depth and with a head of
water similar to the anticipated design layout of the soakaway. All the tests were repeated three times at
each location.
The results of the testing are summarised in Table C.13.

There are insufficient tests to allow statistical analysis so a precautionary approach was taken and the
lowest measured value of infiltration rate of 7. 106 m/s was used for the design. This design value for
the infiltration rate was approved by an experienced ground engineering professional.
A factor of safety was then applied to the infiltration rate to account for possible long-term reductions in
performance. Table 25.2 (Section 25.6) indicates that a factor of safety (FOS) of 1.5 is appropriate for a
drained area of 150 m2 and minor inconvenience or damage if the capacity of the soakaway is exceeded
(exceedance routes from the area drained by soakaways have been considered in the site layout).
The factored design infiltration coefficient (q) is 7. 106 m/s ÷ 1.5 = 4.9 × 106 m/s.
= 0.018 m/h
Step 2 Estimate suitable soakaway dimensions
Rectangular geocellular systems are proposed for the design with a porosity (n) of 0.95. The invert level of the
incoming downpipes will be 0.8 m below ground level. The soakaway dimensions will be 2 m × 2 m × 2 m.
Step 3 Check the maximum likely depth of water in the soakaway for the design rainfall
event, for the proposed soakaway dimensions
(i) Calculate the base area, Ab, and the perimeter, P, from the proposed dimensions
Ab = 4 m2
P = 8 m
(ii) Calculate b
where:
(Equation 25.4, Section 25.6.2)
n = porosity = 0.95
q assumed infiltration rate 0.01 m/h
b = (8 × 0.018)/(4 × 0.95) = 0.038 h1
(iii) Select a range of storm durations and determine corresponding rainfall intensity and hmax
h
max is calculated for a range of durations from 5 minutes up 24 hours.

Therefore the critical duration event, for which the depth of water is greatest, is approximately 6 hours.
Step 4 Check viability of soakaway dimensions
The largest value of hmax is 1.26 m, the depth of soakaway required is therefore 1. m. Assuming the
incoming pipe is 0. m below ground level, then the soakaway will need to be 2.1 m deep. Because the
minimum depth to the maximum groundwater levels over Area A is at least .1 m, this is acceptable. This
provides an unsaturated soil depth below the soakaway of 1.0 m with a freeboard between the maximum
water level in the soakaway and the ground surface of 0.8 m.

Step 5 Check half emptying time
The time taken for this soakaway to drain down to half full may be found in Equation 25.6 for a 3D system.
Time to half empty, t1/2 =
Therefore t1/2 = 12 hours
This is less than 24 hours and is therefore acceptable.

A2 INFILTRATING PERVIOUS PAVEMENT
A concrete block permeable paving system is proposed for the car parks in the residential development
which allows infiltration from the base of the pavement construction into the ground below. This example
follows the design method for planar infiltration systems that is described in Chapters 20 and 25. The
parking areas will be a maximum of 12.5 m by 16 m. Note that the calculations would be similar for other
types of surfacing material (porous asphalt or concrete) with the exception that Step 3 below would refer
to the relevant table for the surfacing material in Chapter 20.
Structural design
Step 1 Estimate subgrade strength
The ground conditions at formation level (ie immediately beneath the base of the pavement) comprise silty
sandy gravels. Laboratory testing has determined that it is non-plastic. From Table 20.4 (Section 20.9.3),
the guideline equilibrium CBR value for the pavement is 7. The actual subgrade CBR value will require
confirmation by site testing when the subgrade is exposed during construction (Section 20.9.3).
Step 2 Determine loading category
The pavement design is for small residential car parks that will be trafficked by cars or light commercial
vehicles. There may be very occasional HGVs that end up turning or parking in the car park, but there will not
be any regular HGV traffic. The site is therefore classified as Site Category (Table 20.5, Section 20.9.4).
Step 3 Determine construction thickness
The construction thickness requirements are taken from Table 20.10 (Section 20.9.6) for traffic category ,
as follows:
80 mm concrete permeable pavers
50 mm bedding layer 2/6.3 aggregate
00 mm sub-base coarse-graded aggregate (CGA), which acts as the water storage layer.
The CBR is greater than 5 and therefore subgrade improvement is not required.
Hydraulic design
The system allows infiltration from the base of the pavement. Infiltration from the sides is negligible as the
depth is so shallow. Therefore the infiltration design procedure described in Equation 25.2 (Section 25.6.1)
for plane systems is used. The design could also be undertaken using commercially available drainage
design software. The hydraulic design is for a 1:100 year rainfall event. Climate change allowance will be
managed by exceedance routing to the site pond.
The site is flat and the pervious pavement does not take runoff from any adjacent areas, so no adjustment
to the depth of the sub-base CGA will be required. The CGA sub-base will be constructed using /20
material which typically has a porosity (n) of 0.3.
Ste stimate ie infitration rate
This process is described in Section C.5.1 (A1 for residential soakaways). This gives a design infiltration
coefficient (q) of .9 106 m/s or 0.018 m/h.
Ste onfirm aement sstem te
The infiltration rate is greater than 1 106 m/s and therefore a system type A (total Infiltration) may be
used (Table 20.1, Section 20.3).
Appendix C: Design example

CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Step 6 Check the maximum likely depth of water in the pavement for the design rainfall
event, for the proposed soakaway dimensions
Select a range of storm durations and determine corresponding rainfall intensity and hmax.
h
max is calculated for a range of durations from 5 minutes up 24 hours
where (from Equation 25.1, Section 25.6.1)
where the drainage ratio, R AD/Ab = 200/200 = 1

The largest value of hmax is 0.11 m which occurs during a 15, 0, 5 and 60 minute storms. The depth of
CGA sub-base of 00 mm required for the traffic loads is therefore sufficient for the hydraulic design.
Step 7 Check viability of pavement dimensions
As the minimum depth to annual maximum groundwater levels over area A is at least m, this is
acceptable. This provides an unsaturated soil depth below the soakaway of at least 1.0 m with a
freeboard between the maximum water level and the ground surface of 0.35 m (the total pavement
thickness is 430 mm).
912 Appendix C
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Figure C.7 Residential infiltration permeable block pavement
Step 8 Check half emptying time
The time taken for this soakaway to drain down to half full may be found in Equation 25.6 (Section 25.7)
for a plane system.
Time to half empty, t1/2 = (n × hmax)/2q
Therefore, t1/2 = 0.9 hours
This is less than 24 hours and is therefore acceptable.
C.5.2 Civic street (B)
B1 INFILTRATION TREE PITS
Tree pits are only able to drain small areas due to their limited sie, although they do require a certain
monthly volume of runoff to keep them alive and support growth.
A system of linked tree pits is proposed to drain the pedestrian areas of the civic street.
Each tree pit will be designed to drain a 10 m by 5 m area of pedestrian surface.
Each tree pit will be constructed using a suitable tree soil. The tree pits will be designed to infiltrate the
1:10 year event.
Step 1 Initial tree pit sizing and characteristics
Each rectangular pit will have a maximum depth to the base of 1 m. The surface area of each pit will be 2 m
by 6 m. This volume of soil has been determined by an arboriculturist to suit the needs of the proposed tree
species. An extra storage layer below the pit will be provided using 0.5 m thick open-graded aggregate such
as Type 4/20 material.
Appendix C: Design example
913
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Ste Water o into it and throuh the tree soi
Tree pit soil specification in Box 19.3 gives limits on the permeability of the soil between 25 mm/h and
115 mm/h.
Each pit will have a surface depression where water will be temporarily stored before if flows down
through the tree pit soil. This depression will be sied to hold the excess water from a 11 year, critical
duration event (assumed here to be a 15 minute event) for water quality treatment. Events greater than
this can flow directly to the drainage layer via an overflow.
The rainfall intensity for the 11 year, 15 min event is 20 mm/h.
Volume of runoff entering the pit (assuming a runoff factor of 0.9) over 15 minutes:
= 0.9 × 50 × (20/1000) × 15/60
= 0.225 m3
Volume of water soaking into the tree soil over 15 minutes assuming permeability of tree pit soil is 25 mm/h:
= 12 × 0.025 × 15/60
= 0.075 m3
Therefore, the storage depth required on the surface of the pit (0.225 0.075)/12 0.012 m
Provide a 100 mm deep depression to store water on surface of pit.
Ste stimate ie infitration rate
Ground conditions in the civic street area are slightly different from the adjacent residential development
area and comprise a mantle of head deposits (about 2 m thick) overlying chalk marl. The head deposits
comprise clayey (sometimes very clayey) slightly silty sand. The chalk marl comprises silty clay. This
was proven to a depth of 3.85 m below ground level by the site investigation. During this investigation no
groundwater was encountered.
Three infiltration tests were undertaken in the area where the tree pits are proposed. Two tests were
in the shallow head deposits and one in the underlying chalk marl. The results of the testing are
summarised in Table C.16.

Test #1
Consideration of the ground conditions and the tests indicates that there is a shallow layer beneath the
development that is suitable for some infiltration. However, the full lateral extent is not known and it is
underlain by clay that is not suitable for infiltration. There is only 1 m of the sand between the base of the
1 m deep pit plus 0.5 m deep drainage layer and the chalk marl. This will limit the volume of water that the
head deposits can accept.
Therefore the tree pits will be designed as an infiltration system, but with an overflow system to collect
and convey the runoff for exceedance events greater than a 1:10 year event to downstream components.
Table C.16 shows that for the second and third tests, the infiltration reduced each time. Using the lowest
value from the test in SA01 gives a site infiltration rate of 1.0 106 m/s.
A factor of safety was then applied to the infiltration rate to account for possible long-term reductions in
performance. Table 25.2 indicates that a FOS of 1.5 is appropriate for a drained area of 50 m2 and minor
inconvenience or damage if the capacity of the tree pit is exceeded (exceedance routes from the area
drained by the tree pits have been considered in the site layout).
The design infiltration coefficient (q) is therefore 1.0 106 m/s ÷ 1.5 = 7 .2 × 107 m/s
= 0.0026 m/h
Step 4 Estimate suitable tree pit dimensions
Rectangular pits are proposed for the design 2 m × 6 m × 1.5 m deep. The aggregate drainage layer will
have a porosity of 0.3.

Therefore the critical duration event, for which the depth of water is greatest, is approximately 6 hours.
Step 6 Check viability of soakaway dimensions
The largest value of hmax is 0. m, which occurs during a 6 hour storm. The depth of water is less than
the depth of the proposed drainage layer and therefore below the level of the tree soil which will minimise
the risks of the soil becoming saturated. An overflow pipe that discharges to a system of underdrains will
be provided above the level of the drainage layer.

CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015

Step 7 Check half emptying time
The time taken for the proposed tree pits to drain down to half full may be found from in Equation 25.6
for a 3D system.
Time to half empty, t1/2 =
Therefore t1/2 = 19 hours
This is less than 2 hours and is therefore acceptable. However, if the time to drain exceeded 2 hours
this may still be acceptable as it would provide more water to be available for the tree which would be
removed by evapotranspiration at some times of the year. The decision to use longer drain down times
would have to be made in conjunction with an arboroculturist.
nfitration bioretention sstem
Bioretention systems are proposed for drainage of the trafficked areas of the street in the civic street area.
Step 1 Estimate suitable bioretention dimensions and characteristics
It is proposed that the bioretention components are designed using a raised outlet. When full, they will
discharge to downstream SuDS components, although normal operation is to dispose of the water via
infiltration and evapotranspiration.
The bioretention system will drain a 500 m2 area of road (which is less than the recommended maximum
of 0.8 ha – see Section 18.2) and needs to provide treatment for the 11 year, critical duration rainfall
event (assumed to be 15 minutes).
Appendix C: Design example
917
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
The proposed surface area of each component is 20 m2 (which, as a percentage of drained area,
20/500 . This is within the recommended range of 2 to ).
The proposed characteristics of the system are summarised in Table C.18.

Step 2 Hydraulic design

The proposed inlet to the bioretention components is a 1 m wide dropped kerb. Assuming a runoff factor
of 0.9, the maximum inflow rate for the 11 year, 15 minute duration event (which has a rainfall intensity of
20 mm/h) will be:
Qin = 500 × 0.9 × 20 × 10 ÷ 3600 = 0.0025 m3/s
Using Manning’s equation (Equation 24.12, Section 24.11.1), assuming a hydraulic roughness coefficient
of 0.0, and a slope of 1/60 gives the following depth velocity flow relationship

(ii) Check surface area of filter bed and time to drain down
Using Equation 18.1 (Section 18.4.1) with a rainfall intensity of 20 mm/h.
Assuming 90 runoff, the volume of water requiring treatment is calculated as follows
Vt = 500 × (20/1000) × 0.9 × 15/60 = 2.25 m3
The required filter surface area is calculated as follows
918 Appendix C
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
where:
Af surface area of filter bed (m2)
Vt volume of water requiring treatment (m3) = 2.25 m3
L filter bed depth (m) 0. m
k coefficient of permeability of filter medium for water (m/s) 0.1 / 600
h average height of water above filter bed (half maximum height) (m) 0.1 m
t time required for water quality treatment volume to percolate through filter bed (s) 600
Therefore:
The bioretention provided has an area of 20 m2 and is therefore acceptable. A smaller area should not be
used as it will increase the risk of the surface clogging.
Step 3 proposed dimensions
Check the maximum likely depth of water for the design rainfall event, for the
A check is undertaken using the same procedure as outlined for the infiltrating tree pits, which confirms
that the drainage layer has sufficient storage for the 110 year event.
Figure C.9 Civic street infiltration bioretention systems
Step 4 Undertake forebay design
To protect the long-term performance of the bioretention system, a small forebay area is proposed
immediately downstream of the dropped kerb inlets.
Appendix C: Design example
919
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
Using Equation 18.2 (Section 18.8.1), the volume of the forebay is determined using the following equation

Therefore, volume of forebay 0.05 0. .1 5 0.6 m3

where:

Af
= 1 m2 (assume a 1 m2 area is provided as a forebay)
n = 0.5
Proportion of sediment captured
R = 0.87 which is greater than target value of 0.8
Therefore, a small 1 m2 forebay is sufficient.
However, for a forebay of these dimensions with the sediment loading rate above, the sediment depth
accumulated in the component = 0.6 m3/1 m2 = 0.6 m which is too deep.
To limit to 200 mm depth, the forebay area must be increased to m2 or the contributing area reduced (ie
a greater number of systems provided).
Ste he aait of the underdrains is suffiient
The underdrains should then be designed using standard pipe design methods (not covered here). The
flow capacity along the pipes should be checked, as well as the flow capacity into the perforations (taking
account of the permeability of any geotextile surround).
Step 6 Landscape and biodiversity design
Once the basic layout and dimensions are achieved, the planting and specific detailed layout and
materials would be designed by the landscape architect or planner to fit the overall streetscape.

C.5.3 Supermarket (C)
C1 Rainwater harvesting system
The supermarket is keen to use harvested rainwater for non-potable uses on the site and to size the
rainwater harvesting system to manage surface water runoff from the roof as far as possible.
Roof runoff poses a very low risk to groundwater, and the excess runoff that cannot be harvested will spill
to a separate tank for infiltration.
Designing the rainwater harvesting system to manage surface runoff follows the guidance in Chapter 11,

The roof area is split naturally into two independent sections, one of which has an area of 1900 m2

Therefore, this smaller area is drained to the rainwater harvesting system, and the remaining roof area is
drained to a separate soakaway tank (not designed here).
Step 2 Estimate the rainwater harvesting storage tank capacity required to deliver both

Figure C.10 Supermarket roof rainwater harvesting systems
C3 Lined pervious pavement
The pervious pavement serves the car park to the supermarket. The surface will be concrete block
permeable paving in the car parking bays with an aggregate sub-base for surface water storage. The
running aisles will be impermeable asphalt surfacing with normal road pavement construction below (ie
no storage of water).
The car park is on a 1:200 slope in many places.
Structural design
Step 1 Estimate subgrade strength
The ground conditions at formation level comprise a clay material. Laboratory testing has determined
that it has a plasticity index (PI) of 2. From Table 20.4 (Section 20.9.3) the guideline equilibrium CBR
value for pervious surfaces is (a plasticity index of 2 lies between two values so use the CBR
for a PI of 0). The subgrade CBR value will require confirmation by site testing when the subgrade is
exposed during construction.
Step 2 Determine loading category
The site is a large car park that is trafficked mainly by cars or light commercial vehicles. There may be
HGVs that end up turning or parking in the car park. The site is therefore classified as site category 5
(Table 20.5, Section 20.9.4).
Step 3 Determine construction thickness
The construction thickness requirements are taken from Table 20.10 (Section 20.9.6) for traffic category 5,
as follows:
80 mm concrete permeable pavers
50 mm bedding layer 2/6.3 aggregate
100 mm hydraulically bound coarse-graded aggregate or 70 mm AC32 asphalt concrete
150 mm sub-base CGA, which will also act as the water storage layer in the hydraulic design below.
Appendix C: Design example
923
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
The CBR is and therefore subgrade improvement is required that is 225 mm thick. In this case,
the improvement layer will be provided using an additional depth of CGA material to provide extra
storage capacity.
Alternative surfacing materials in the parking bays could comprise:
porous asphalt (Table 20.8, Section 20.9.6) which would mean a requirement for
160 mm porous asphalt
150 mm sub-base CGA
225 mm subgrade improvement layer (use CGA)
porous concrete (Table 20.9, Section 20.9.6) which would mean a requirement for
150 mm plain porous concrete
00 mm sub-base CGA
225 mm subgrade improvement layer (use CGA).
Step 4 Hydraulic design
The pavement needs to be designed to store the 1100 year event. The car park covers an area of 5,000 m2
and the aisles (ie impermeable areas) comprise 0 of the total parking area.
The estimated total storage for the whole development site is 16,000 m3 (Section C.4.1, Step 2).
The total impermeable area is 22 ha (Table C.10).
Therefore the storage required is 16,000 (.5/22) 255 m3
The porosity of the sub-base is assumed to be 0.(Section 20.11.4).
 for materials meeting the specification in Table 20.14
The aisles will drain onto the parking bays as far as possible, and at 0 of the overall area, this meets
the limiting ratio of 2:1 impermeable to permeable.
Depth of sub-base volume of storage required/(area of parking bays porosity of sub-base)
Depth of sub-base 255/(0.6 5,000 0.) 0.05 m or 05 mm.
As long as the subgrade improvement layer is provided using CGA material, the depth of the storage
within the CGA will be sufficient. For block paving, the sub-base and subgrade improvement layer is a
total of 75 mm thick and this will require increasing to 10 mm to meet the hydraulic requirements.
However, the site is on a 1200 slope. The water will run to one end unless check dams or terracing are
provided. The detailed design of this would depend on the detailed layout of the car park (Section 20.5)
and is not covered here.
C4 Proprietary treatment system
The lorry parking and service area of the retail store site will drain to the detention basin. However, this
basin is a surface component and part of the amenity space, so although the runoff will pass through
several subsequent treatment components before discharge, it should not have visible pollution as this
could damage the appearance of the detention basin. As a minimum therefore, the system should be
designed to trap sediments and hydrocarbons.

C4 Detention basin
The detention basin provides Interception and attenuation storage for the retail lorry service area
behind the store, which has an area of 1.65 ha. It will be lined at a depth of 1.0 m to provide protection to
underlying groundwater. The estimated design characteristics are:
100 year storage volume = 0.056 m3/m2 1.65 10,000 92 m3
.
Use initial estimate of 1200 m3 to account for high impermeability of service area relative to rest of site.
100 year greenfield runoff rate 1.65 10,000 0.0007 l/s/m2 = 13 l/s (see Table C.9)
Step 1 Check the dimensions of the basin
If the area available for the basin is 1200 m2 (width 20 m, length 60 m), with side slopes of 1, then

Therefore, the 100 year volume would be stored at a depth of approximately 1 m, which is acceptable.

h = 1.0 m
g = 9.81 m/s2
Diameter of orifice to restrict the flow to the 1100 year greenfield flow (1 l/s) is approximately 0 mm.
Step 3 Check maximum velocities and residence times for treatment
For a 20 mm/h 11 year, 15 minute rainfall event and a runoff factor of 0.9, the rate of runoff is 2.5 l/s.
Assuming this event is distributed over the base width of the detention basin:
Assume 11 m width – from calculated dimensions at 1.5 m depth below ground surface = 1.0 m plus a 0.5 m
freeboard plus landscaping allowance. (Note this could be reduced to 0. m in final design).
Assume slope of basin from inlet to outlet is 1100, ie 0.01.
Assume Manning’s roughness coefficient from below grass flow is 0.5, then using Manning’s equation
(Equation 24.12, Section 24.11.1):
TABLE

80 0.053 55.169
100 0.062 80.022
120 0.070 108.437
Therefore, at a flow rate of 2.5 l/s, the depth of flow will be approximately 100 mm and the velocity will be
approximately 0.06 m/s which is acceptable (Section 17.4.1 for conveyance swale treatment design).
Assuming the flow path length at a depth of just over 1 m, is approximately 5 m (Table C.20), and the
flow velocity is approximately 0.06 m/s, then the residence time 5/0.06 15 minutes (which is greater
than 9 minutes, therefore sufficient).

Step 4 Landscape design
Once the volume and general water depths have been determined, the precise landscape form and
926 Appendix C

planting in the basin will be developed by the landscape architect and ecologists to meet the amenity and
biodiversity objectives. The planting could include trees and shrubs to support specific bird species.
C.5.4 Industrial area (D)
D1 Filter strip
The filter strip provides the first level of treatment for the runoff from the lorry park, and operates as
pre-treatment for the filter drain. It is lined at a depth of 1 m to ensure adequate groundwater protection.
Chapter 15 gives details for designing filter strips. The filter strip enables pollutants (particularly oils and
heavy metals) to be easily seen and trapped early in the treatment train. There is space available for a 5 m
wide strip on one side of the lorry park where the levels on the surface fall towards the area proposed for
the filter strip. A schematic of the proposed filter strip is shown in Figure C.13 and design details are given
in Table C.22.
Figure C.1 Filter strip (and downstream filter drain) serving the lorry park
Assuming a time of concentration (critical event duration) of 15 minutes, the rainfall intensity for the 11
year event is 20 mm/hr. A runoff factor of 0.9 is also assumed.

30 0.028 290 0.290
35 0.031 374 0.374
This demonstrates that the 11 year treatment event will flow at a depth of 15 mm (ie below the height
of the vegetation), with a velocity of less than 0. m. This means that design criteria for the treatment
event are met.
Step 2 Check residence time for 1:1 year event
The flow velocity is approximately 0.01 m/s, therefore the time to travel 5 m filter strip is just over
minutes. This is just acceptable, but if there is scope to increase the width of strip that would be better.
Ste he o eoities for more etreme eents
A check is required that velocities remain below 1.5 m/s for extreme flows to prevent erosion.
Assuming a rainfall intensity of 150 mm/hr for the 1:100 year event:
Q = 0.150/3600 × 0.85 × 104 × 0.9 ×1000 = 323 l/s which meets the design criteria of < 1.5 m/s for the
extreme event.
D2 Filter drain
The proposed filter drain is 1 m wide and 2 m deep, as shown in Figure C.14.
The ground profile adjacent to the filter drain will be such as to direct flows in excess of the 110 year
storm towards downstream components. This will also act as a failsafe mechanism should lack of
maintenance result in the drain becoming blocked.
The sand/pea gravel layer above the filter material will also act as treatment in preventing ingress of
fine material from the car park. This layer can be removed and replaced together with the underlying
geotextile, if required.

Where:

Perforation area

Number of perforations 40 per m length of pipe
Total number of perforations 50 0 1,000
Q per perforation 1.6509 105 m3/s
Q total 0.23 m3/s
This flow rate exceeds the rate of flow through the filter aggregate, therefore the design is acceptable.
Standard design tables can then be used to check the capacity of the 100 mm diameter perforated pipe
to carry the design flows.
D3 Underdrained swale
The swale is draining the car park and delivery area for the industrial unit, together with the external
service areas for the industrial site.
An underdrained swale has been agreed as an appropriate precautionary approach, as it means that
there is a low risk of silts being transferred downstream and it delivers a high level of treatment.
The swale drains an area of 4.1 ha. The swale lies adjacent to the road and will be inaccessible from that
side. Therefore a vertical roadside edge is acceptable, with a 1 slope on the industrial site side.
The swale is 600 m long, m wide and has a longitudinal slope of 1100 (0.01).
930 Appendix C
CIRIA SuDS Manual 2015
An underdrained swale (without lining) can be assumed to deliver Interception for 25x its area which is .1 ha.

The 1100 year flow rate has a velocity below 1.5 m/s, which is acceptable.
The runoff rates and depths would need confirmation via modelling at detailed design stage.
D4 Wetland area
A small wetland area is required to provide additional treatment of the industrial area runoff before
discharge to the amenity pond. A rough rule of thumb for sizing a pond/wetland for treatment is to make
sure that the volume of permanent water is equal to the volume of water that requires treatment (known
as the treatment volume).
Area available for the wetland = 800 m2
Assume runoff factor = 0.8
Combined lorry park and factory hard standing area = 4.95 ha (this is 0.85 lorry park area plus 4.1 factory
hard standing area)
Volume of water requiring treatment (known as the treatment volume) .95 104 × 15 × 10-3 × 0.8 = 600 m3
(where 15 mm is the upper limit rainfall depth recommended in Section 23.5)
Average depth of permanent pool 600/00 0.75 m, which is acceptable.
In order to protect wetland planting, the attenuation storage depth (above the permanent water level) was
limited to 0. m, which provides a maximum attenuation storage volume of 20 m3 for the component.

C.5.5 Strategic site SuDS components
S1 Strategic conveyance swale running north–south through the site
This swale drains excess flows from the residential one, the civic street one and the supermarket
together with all the runoff from the roads.
Assume:
residential area infiltrates to 110 year
civic street area infiltrates to 110 year
supermarket area managed to 1100 year greenfield
roads: unmanaged
For 10 year event
(Note that these are relatively crude conservative estimates for initial design purposes.)
For residential and civic street areas (ie areas A and B)
rainfall intensity = 100 mm/h
runoff factor = 0.8
Q = 100 x 10-3 × 0.8 × (6.5 + 4.5) × 104/3600 = 2.44 m3/s
For supermarket area (area C)
Runoff controlled to greenfield runoff rates (see Table C.11) = 0.033 m3/s
For roads
rainfall intensity = 100 mm/h
runoff factor = 0.9
Q = 100 × 10-3 × 0.9 × 1.5 × 104/3600 = 0.375 m3/s
Estimated total flow to swale for 10 year event 2. 0.0 0.75 2.5 m3/s
This would need confirmation via modelling at detailed design stage.
A 3 m width of swale over 1000 m = 3000 m2. Average slope = 0.01
Interception delivery = 3000 × 25 × 10-4 = 7.5 ha
This is acceptable for retail service area (1.65 ha) and impermeable areas draining to permeable
pavement (1.4 ha).
Step 1 Check capacity of the swale for the 30 year event
Assume average Manning’s n 0.15 for high flows
Assume average flow width 6 m
(This takes account of flow across the side slopes. At a 1 m depth of flow, with side slopes of 1, the
effective width would be (2 1) 9 m, which gives an average width of ( 9)/2 6 m)

Therefore, the depth of flow for the 10 year event would be approximately 50 mm, at a velocity of 0.6 m/s,
which meets the design criteria

This gives a flow depth of approximately 95 mm at a velocity of 0. m/s, which meets the design criteria.
The swale length is over 1000 m, therefore the residence time will be substantially greater than 1 minutes
(1000 m / 0.06 m/s 200 minutes), and is therefore acceptable.

This provides final stage polishing and the remaining attenuation storage, and also high value amenity
and biodiversity benefits. The need for the pond base to be made suitably impermeable to retain
permanent water levels and to prevent groundwater from reducing the available attenuation storage in the
pond should be given full consideration as part of the detailed design.
Step 1 Estimate the required attenuation storage
A rough estimate is made of the remaining storage likely to be required in the pond. This would need
confirmation via modelling at detailed design stage.

Total attenuation storage required in the pond 19 16 0 1510 172 6 710 m3
Section 24.9.4 suggests that an additional 25 should be added to initial storage volume estimates to
allow for lack of inclusion of head discharge relationships.
Therefore total attenuation storage required in the pond 5 m3
For a uniform pond area of about 5000 m2, this would mean 1. m depth. Based on a bank slope of 1 in 5,
however, the actual depth will be around 1.5 m.
This is indicated as acceptable for this scale of event by the site health and safety risk assessment.
Step 2 Calculate treatment volume
A rough rule of thumb for sizing a pond for treatment is to make sure the volume of permanent water in
the pond is equal to the volume of water that requires treatment (known as the treatment volume).
For a 11 year return period (required for treatment) areas A, B and the supermarket roof would not be
contributing. Therefore:
Total area = 31.1 – (6.5 + 4.5 + 0.9) = 19.2 ha
If assume
rainfall depth that requires treatment is 15 mm (based on maximum recommended treatment
volume, Section 23.5)
average runoff factor = 0.5
Treatment volume = 19.2 × 104 × 15 × 10-3 × 0.5 = 1440 m3
Based on a pond area of about 5000 m2, the average depth would be approximately 0. m (see Figure C.11).
Ste onfirm si ees to onerm Storae
To adequately control the volumes of runoff from the site, a spill will be required into a Long-Term Storage
area (probably the adjacent sports pitches), or else the runoff rate will need constraining further and the
attenuation storage volume increased.
A detailed model will be required to determine which option would be preferable with respect to the
performance of the system.
The depth of inundation of the estimated 2640 m3 of Long-Term Storage (see Section C.4.1, Step 3)
would be 0.2 m, if spread over 2 7000 m2 football pitches.

C.5.6 Detailed system sizing
A detailed model of the contributing catchment and drainage system is required in order to check that
all criteria have been achieved. The calculations above provide initial siing information and allow a first
estimate to be modelled, which can then be refined to achieve the required results. The particular checks
that should now be made with the detailed model are as follows:
greenfield discharge rates achieved for 11, 110 and 1100 year
no unplanned flooding on the site for the 10 year critical site event (short duration, high intensity event)
no flooding of property from the site drainage system for the 1100 year critical site event (short
duration, high intensity event)
no flooding of property for key blockage scenarios
the possible impact and performance of the pond for the maximum 1:100 year river level for a range
of return period events (a joint probability analysis may be required depending on this assessment).
