Foreword
Now more than ever we need to place Nature at the heart of making
and regenerating attractive, investable places that are good for
people, climate, and the economy. Good design that integrates
green infrastructure from the outset is essential if we are to deliver
the Nature recovery, climate change adaptation, net zero targets,
health and wellbeing benefits and the economic prosperity that we
need. Examples of green infrastructure design features include
pocket parks, green roofs, street trees and ‘rain gardens’, which can
all play a role in supporting and enhancing Nature in urban areas,
as well as delivering benefits for people.
For me the greenspace close to where I live is a vitally important
place that contributes hugely to quality of life, through being an
attractive place for exercise, a daily dose of green and casual
encounters with Nature, such as the mature deciduous trees that
chart the changing seasons, the summer visiting common terns
flying along the river, small tortoiseshell caterpillars growing bigger
by the day on the nettles in the un-mowed areas or simply having
enough open space to create a horizon that reveals the sight of
dramatic clouds and the ever changing sky. Even though we live in
the centre of the city of Cambridge, having that daily connection
with Nature and its cycles is an essential part of what makes our
neighbourhood so liveable and popular.
People often feel passionate about their local greenspace because
it’s a place where they experience and connect with Nature. Green
and blue spaces provide the places we meet, socialise, relax,
exercise, and connect with Nature on a day-to-day basis. They
provide an estimated £25.6bn of ‘recreational welfare value’ every
year and do so in a very cost effective manner, considering how
only a fraction of that value is needed to maintain them. The cost
effectiveness point is demonstrated in how for every £1 spent on
parks in England an estimated £7 in additional value for health and
wellbeing and the environment is generated. Green infrastructure
provides other important services for society, trees for example,
can help store carbon, provide valuable shade, and, when
positioned appropriately, help reduce flooding and buffer noise
and air pollution. Other green and blue spaces bring a range of
benefits including for food, biodiversity, and pollination.
However, inequalities in access to greenspace were brought into
sharp focus during the coronavirus pandemic. So, in this design
guide we set out how good planning and design can help to address
these inequalities by supporting the ambition that:
Everyone has access to and benefit from good quality green and
blue spaces within 15 minutes’ walk from home.
Good design can help to make towns and cities greener and more
beautiful, attracting inward investment, retaining skilled staff, and
increasing productivity. Greener high streets can encourage people
to visit them and stay longer, becoming more economically
successful and resilient. Green roofs and walls can insulate
buildings, helping to reduce energy use, whilst also generating
energy when designed as biosolar roofs. In this design guide we set
out how good design can:
Support an uplift in the greening of residential urban
neighbourhoods to at least 40% (or UGF 0.4) average green cover
(in areas that don’t meet this baseline) and support an uplift in
urban woodland canopy cover.

The Green Infrastructure Planning and Design Guide provides
evidence based practical guidance on how to plan and design good
green infrastructure. It complements the National Model Design
Code1 and National Design Guide1 and can be used to help planners
and designers develop local design guides and codes with
multifunctional green infrastructure at the heart. It will also be
useful to landscape architects, urban designers, parks and
greenspace managers and neighbourhood planning bodies.
Restoring Nature is one of the most important things we can do for
the long-term health and prosperity of people, wildlife, and our
economy. Using the Green Infrastructure Planning and Design
Guide can support Government’s 25 Year Environment Plan
commitment to leave the environment in a better state than it was
before and to making greener, healthier, climate resilient,
distinctive, and thriving places to live learn work and play.

Introduction
1.1 Purpose of the Design Guide
This guide aims to provide practical, evidence-based advice on how
to plan, design, deliver and manage good quality green
infrastructure that helps to create beautiful nature-rich places that
support people’s health and wellbeing, make places more resilient
to climate change, and create attractive investable places that are
good for the economy.
It is aimed primarily at local authorities, particularly those officers
within local authorities who are responsible for generating design
codes, but it is also intended to be of value to a wider readership
that includes planners, developers, urban designers, engineers,
landscape architects, ecologists, and neighbourhood planning
bodies, as well as anyone responsible for the development and
management of accessible natural green space and other green
infrastructure. It also aims to help other sectors, including health,
transport, energy, education, heritage, and regeneration, to identify
opportunities to deliver their policies. The aim is to integrate and
mainstream good green infrastructure solutions.
2 Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, 2021 (Department
for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities)
The guide is part of Natural England’s National Green
Infrastructure Framework (see Chapter 2) and complements the
National Model Design Code and National Design Guide2 (see
Chapter 3).
The guide advises on:
• How to apply the National Green Infrastructure Framework,
including Principles and Standards to good design.
• How to design green infrastructure features as the building
blocks of a larger interconnected network.
• How to combine green infrastructure features within
different area types to create multifunctional and connected
networks at different scales.
• How to design green infrastructure to meet identified needs;
in particular - nature, health, wellbeing, climate change
adaptation and mitigation, water management, and
economic prosperity.
• How to develop landscape led green infrastructure with a
focus on landscape character and local distinctiveness.
• The application of tools and strategies such as Biodiversity
Net Gain, Urban Greening Factors and Local Nature Recovery
Strategies, in the context of green infrastructure design.

sources of further information.
1.2 What is Green Infrastructure?
The National Planning Policy Framework 2021 defines green
infrastructure ‘as a network of multifunctional green and blue
spaces and other natural features, urban and rural, which is capable
of delivering a wide range of environmental, economic, health and
wellbeing benefits for nature, climate, local and wider communities
and prosperity.’
A green infrastructure network includes street trees, green roofs,
green walls, parks, private gardens, allotments, sustainable
drainage systems, through to wildlife areas, woodlands, rock
outcrops, wetlands, and natural flood management functioning at
local and landscape scale. Linear green infrastructure includes
roadside verges, green bridges, field margins, rights of way, access
routes, and canals and rivers.
Green infrastructure is also described by the JNCC as blue green
infrastructure. Blue Infrastructure is the term used to refer to the
water elements of green infrastructure, including watercourses,
waterbodies, and wetlands. Nature-based Solutions (N-bS) is a term
used to describe many of the elements of green infrastructure. The
IUCN uses the term Nature-based Solutions to describe ‘natural and
modified ecosystems that address societal challenges effectively
and adaptively, simultaneously providing human well-being and
biodiversity benefits.’
Good quality green infrastructure is a vital component of both
urban and rural environments. Well-designed and managed green
infrastructure generates multiple benefits for people and nature; it
creates greener, healthier, more climate resilient and more
equitable places to live that in turn support a more productive and
sustainable economy.
Green infrastructure plays a big role in climate change mitigation
by sequestering carbon and to climate change adaptation through
urban cooling and reducing flood risk.
Improvements to green infrastructure can be delivered as part of
new development through the planning process, better
management and upgrading of existing green infrastructure, and
retrofitting of new green infrastructure, wherever opportunities
arise, but particularly in areas where provision is poor.

2.1 Green Infrastructure Framework
The Green Infrastructure Framework: Principles and Standards for
England is a commitment to the Government’s 25 Year Environment
Plan. The aim is to green our towns and cities and improve existing
green infrastructure. The components of the Green Infrastructure
Framework are set out in Figure 1.
Further Information on the Framework, including the green
infrastructure mapping database can be found here. Of particular
importance for the planning, design and nurture of green
infrastructure are the Green Infrastructure Principles, which set
out:
• Why green infrastructure is important for nature, physical
and mental health and wellbeing, prosperity, water, and
climate.
• What good green infrastructure looks like - multi-functional
and varied, connected, accessible and responsive to
landscape (including historic) character.
• How to plan, design and nurture green infrastructure,

2.2 Green Infrastructure Principles
When designing green infrastructure, it is important to consider
how it is planned and designed strategically from the outset, the
key characteristics or attributes of a green infrastructure network
and the outcomes required. Thinking about these principles from
the outset can inform good design. A summary of the Green
Infrastructure Principles is given below. More detailed guidance on
the Green Infrastructure Principles can be found on the Natural
England Green Infrastructure website.
Providing multi-functionality and designing with management and
maintenance in mind can be particularly problematic, because of
divisions in responsibility, which means that special consideration
should be given to these principles.
WHY Green Infrastructure is important (its benefits/
outcomes)
Why 1: Nature-Rich Beautiful Places - Green infrastructure supports
nature to recover and thrive everywhere, in towns, cities and
countryside, conserving and enhancing natural beauty, wildlife
and habitats, geology and soils, and our cultural and personal
connections with nature.
Why 2: Active and Healthy Places - Green neighbourhoods,
green/blue spaces and green routes support active lifestyles, sense
of place, community cohesion and nature connections that benefit
physical and mental health, wellbeing, and quality of life. Green
infrastructure also helps to mitigate health risk factors such as
urban heat stress, noise pollution, flooding, and poor air quality.
Why 3: Thriving and Prosperous Communities - GI helps to create
and support prospering communities that benefit everyone and
adds value by creating high quality environments which are
attractive to businesses and investors, create green jobs, support
retail and high streets, and help support the local economy and
regeneration.
Why 4: Improved Water Management - Green infrastructure
reduces flood risk, improves water quality and natural filtration,
helps maintain the natural water cycle and sustainable drainage at
local and catchment scales, reducing pressures on the water
environment and infrastructure, bringing amenity, biodiversity,
economic and other benefits.
Why 5: Resilient and Climate Positive Places - Green infrastructure
makes places more resilient and adaptive to climate change and
helps to meet zero carbon and air quality targets. Green
infrastructure itself should be designed to adapt to climate change
to ensure long term resilience.
WHAT good Green Infrastructure looks like (the
attributes of good green infrastructure)
What 1: Multifunctional - Green infrastructure should deliver a
range of functions and benefits for people, nature, and places, and
be designed to meet their needs. Multifunctionality (delivering
multiple functions from the same area of green infrastructure) is
especially important in areas where provision is scarce or of poor
quality.
What 2: Varied - Green infrastructure should comprise a variety of
types and sizes of green and blue spaces, green routes, and 
Page 13 of 138
environmental features (as part of a network) that can provide a
range of different functions, benefits, and solutions to address
specific issues and needs.
What 3: Connected - Green infrastructure should function and
connect as a living network for people and nature at all scales (e.g.,
within sites, across regions and at the national scale). It should
enhance ecological networks and support ecosystems services,
connecting provision of green infrastructure with those who need
its benefits.
What 4: Accessible - Green infrastructure should create and
maintain green liveable places that enable people to experience
and connect with nature, and that offer everyone, wherever they
live, access to good quality parks, green spaces, walking and cycling
routes that are inclusive, safe, welcoming, well-managed and
accessible for all.
What 5: Character - Green infrastructure should respond to an
area’s character so that it contributes to the conservation,
enhancement and/or restoration of landscapes; or, in degraded
areas, creates new high-quality landscapes to which local people
feel connected.
HOW to Plan, Design, and Nurture Green Infrastructure
How 1: Partnership and Vision - Work in partnership and
collaborate with stakeholders from the outset to identify
opportunities and constraints, co-plan, develop and deliver a vision
for green infrastructure in the area. Engage a diverse and inclusive
range of people and organisations including citizens, neighbouring
local authorities, developers, communities, landowners, green
space managers, environmental, health, climate, transport, and
business representatives.
How 2: Evidence - Use scientific evidence, and good land use
practices when planning and enhancing green and blue
infrastructure. Understand existing green infrastructure assets and
the environmental, social, and economic challenges and needs in
the area. Refer to good practice for caring for and enhancing green
infrastructure.
How 3: Plan Strategically - Plan strategically and secure green
infrastructure as a key asset in local strategy and policy, at all scales.
Fully integrate and mainstream green infrastructure into
environmental, social, health and economic policy. Create and
maintain sustainable places for current and future populations,
and address inequalities in green infrastructure provision and its
benefits.
How 4: Design – Understand an area’s landscape/townscape,
natural, historic and cultural character to create well-designed,
well-managed, beautiful, and distinctive places.
How 5: Managed, valued, monitored, and evaluated - Plan good
governance, funding, management, monitoring, and evaluation of
green infrastructure as a key asset from the outset and secure it for
the long-term. Make the business case for green infrastructure.
Engage communities in stewardship where appropriate. Celebrate
success and raise awareness of green infrastructure benefits.
Page 14 of 138
2.3 Green Infrastructure Standards
The Green Infrastructure Framework includes national Headline
Green Infrastructure Standards, which set out the ambition for
green infrastructure in terms of quantity, quality, and type to
enable everyone to benefit from good green infrastructure. These
standards will be voluntary and are referred to in the National
Model Design Guide. National standards can then be applied
through local strategies, plans and policies, engaging with
communities and stakeholders, so that they respond to local
context and needs. Green infrastructure delivery can be planned
through a series of local targets.
The Headline Green Infrastructure Standards, when used together
in a place will guide the quantity, accessibility/proximity, capacity,
function, and quality of the green infrastructure, to deliver the 5
‘What’ Principles for good green infrastructure, enabling the
resulting green infrastructure to deliver the main 5 ‘Why’ or
outcomes of green infrastructure. These Headline GI Standards will
in due course be supported by a wider Menu of GI Standards, with
a signposting table that allows users to identify the standards that
match their purpose, context, and outcomes, and shows which
3 Major development - For housing, development where 10 or more homes will
be provided, or the site has an area of 0.5 hectares or more. For non-residential
development it means additional floorspace of 1,000m2 or more, or a site of 1
standards help to deliver the Green Infrastructure Principles in
different contexts.
The Green Infrastructure Standards can help to support good
design. Local plan green infrastructure policies in development
plans and local design codes will set the context for development
and should be referred to for local development requirements.
The Headline Green Infrastructure Standards are set out below.
They distinguish the recommended levels of achievement for major
new developments3 and for area wide application.
Summary of Headline Green Infrastructure Standards
1. Green Infrastructure Strategy Standard
Area wide:
• Local authorities, working in partnership with stakeholders
including local communities, assess and strategically plan
their green infrastructure provision, for example as part of a
green infrastructure strategy. Plans set out how green
infrastructure will help to create greener, beautiful,
healthier, and more prosperous neighbourhoods, with a
hectare or more, or as otherwise provided in the Town and Country Planning
(Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015. 
Page 15 of 138
thriving nature network that can reduce air and water
pollution, support sustainable drainage, and help places
adapt to climate change.
In doing this, they apply the National Green Infrastructure
Standards locally (adapting them to local context where
appropriate) and set green infrastructure policies, proposals
and development requirements in development plans and
local design codes. Local authorities set SMART targets in a
Delivery Plan for achieving the national standards and local
policies over time, as well as arrangements for the long-term
management and maintenance of all green infrastructure.
• Plan and monitor and evaluate progress against delivery of
these local targets every five years.
Major development:
• Each major new development has a green infrastructure
plan (which may be part of a Design and Access Statement)
setting out how the development will deliver the local green
infrastructure policies, proposals and development
requirements in development plans and local design codes.
The green infrastructure delivered within (or associated
with) major new developments should be managed,
maintained, and monitored for a minimum of 30 years.
2. Accessible Greenspace Standards, including Quality Standards
Area wide:
• Accessible Greenspace Standards (AGS) – size and proximity
criteria: Everyone has access to good quality green and blue
spaces close to home for health and wellbeing and contact
with nature, to meet the Accessible Greenspace Standard
size and proximity criteria (see Figure 2), with an initial focus
on access to green and blue spaces within 15 minutes’ walk
from home.
• Accessible Greenspace Standards – capacity criteria: Local
authorities have at least 3 hectares of publicly accessible
greenspace per 1,000 population and there is no net loss or
reduction in capacity of accessible greenspace per 1,000
population. Local authorities specify capacity targets for all
major residential development informed by a local
accessible greenspace baseline, and considering local
needs, opportunities, and constraints.
• Accessible Greenspace Standards – quality criteria:
Accessible greenspace meets the Green Flag Award Criteria,
and best practice in accessibility for all at an area wide scale.
Major development:
• Accessible Greenspace Standards – size and proximity
criteria: For all major residential developments, the local
authority specifies to the developer the quantity, size, and
distance criteria (see Figure 2) for any accessible greenspace
to be provided within/ associated with the development,
based on the Accessible Greenspace Standards.
• Accessible Greenspace Standards – capacity criteria: All
major residential development is designed to meet capacity 
Page 16 of 138
targets (hectares of accessible greenspace per 1,000
population), specified by the local planning authority.
• Accessible Greenspace Standards – quality criteria:
Accessible greenspace meets the Green Flag Award Criteria,
and best practice in accessibility for all in major new
developments.
3. Urban Nature Recovery Standard
Area wide:
• In urban and urban fringe areas, the proportion of green
infrastructure that is designed and managed for nature
recovery is increased by an agreed percentage based on a
locally defined baseline and considering local needs,
opportunities, and constraints. This includes the creation
and restoration of wildlife rich habitats, which can
contribute to the delivery of local nature recovery
objectives.
• Local authorities in urban and urban fringe areas set targets
for nature recovery through provision and sustainable
management of Local Nature Reserves and Local Wildlife
Sites, to:
 Provide 1 hectare of Local Nature Reserve (LNR) per 1,000
population (for nature conservation and quiet
enjoyment).
 Enhance existing and identify new areas that qualify as
Local Wildlife Sites (for nature conservation).
Major Development:
• The developer identifies in the green infrastructure plan for
the development (and in the Design and Access Statement,
as appropriate), its contribution to nature recovery and the
creation and restoration of wildlife rich habitats, which can
contribute to the delivery of local nature recovery
objectives, including the potential for creation or
enhancement of Local Nature Reserves or Local Wildlife
Sites.
4. Urban Greening Factor Standard
Area wide:
• Urban greening is at least 40% average green cover in urban
residential neighbourhoods where they do not already meet
that standard. There is no net loss of green cover in urban
neighbourhoods.
Major Development:
• Major development meets National Urban Greening Factors
of at least 0.3 for commercial development, 0.4 for
residential development, (and, where appropriate, 0.5 for
residential greenfield development).
5. Urban Tree Canopy Cover Standard
Area wide:
Page 17 of 138
• Urban Tree Canopy Cover is increased by an agreed
percentage based on a locally defined baseline and
considering local needs, opportunities, and constraints.
Major Development:
• Major residential and commercial development is designed
to meet these targets.
• New and existing trees are incorporated into new
developments and new streets are tree lined (in line with
National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) requirements4).
Notes to accompany the Green Infrastructure Standards
• Long term management and maintenance underpins all the
standards as set out in the Green Infrastructure Strategy
Standard.
• Suitable Alternative Natural Greenspace (SANGS), which is
the name given to greenspace that is of a quality and type
suitable to provide alternative greenspace to divert visitors
from visiting sensitive sites such as Special Protection Areas
(SPAs). SANGS are intended to provide mitigation for the
potential impact of residential development on the SPA by
preventing an increase in visitor pressure on the SPA. To
achieve this, a higher standard than the Accessible
4 Paragraph 131
Greenspace Standards (above) is often set, i.e., a SANGs
Standard of 8 hectares per 1,000 head of new population.
The effectiveness of SANGS as mitigation will also depend
upon the location and design.
• The Accessible Greenspace Standards refer to Green Flag
Award criteria.
• The Accessible Greenspace Standards refer to best practice
in accessibility for all. This is set out in The Sensory Trust By
All Reasonable Mean: least restrictive access to the outdoors
Commissioned by Natural England in collaboration with
Natural Resources Wales, The Sensory Trust, Cornwall,
England.
Access to Greenspace Close to Home Target
Local Authorities are encouraged to adopt a local Greenspace Close
to Home Access target:
• Everyone has access to a variety of good quality green and
blue spaces within fifteen minutes’ walk of their home by
date x (local authorities to set date).
This could be defined in terms of the Accessible Greenspace
Standards, EITHER a Doorstep OR Local Accessible Greenspace:
Page 18 of 138
• A Doorstep Accessible Greenspace of at least 0.5ha within
200 metres.
• A Local Accessible Natural Greenspace of at least 2ha within
300 metres.
AND a Neighbourhood Accessible Natural Greenspace
• A medium sized Neighbourhood Accessible Natural
Greenspace (10ha) within 1km.
As a minimum, there should be an ambition for everyone to have
access to a variety of greenspace within 15 minutes’ walk from
home. This could be a stepping stone to achieving a fuller range of
size-proximity Accessible Greenspace Standards.
Natural England has done initial baseline analysis of the 15-minute
target in its Mapping Database, but further work is needed to refine
this further. This will be available in 2023.
2.4 Monitoring and evaluation
Natural England has developed an Evaluation Plan for the Green
Infrastructure Framework, to help monitor progress at a national
level. This proposes the indicators for green infrastructure which
relate to each of the Green Infrastructure Standards, to measure and
monitor their achievement.
These indicators will contribute to reporting on the 25 YEP Outcome
Indicator Framework, which includes an indicator (G3) for
enhancing Green and Blue Infrastructure. The G3 indicator is in
development for reporting in 2023, and will cover accessibility,
greenness, and perceptions of green infrastructure quality.
In addition, we will provide guidelines for local authorities to
undertake their own local monitoring against their locally set
targets.
Self-Assessment and Accreditation
Local authorities can self-assess their green infrastructure against
the emerging Green Infrastructure Standards. Further detailed
guidance on applying the Green Infrastructure Standards can be
found on the Green Infrastructure Framework website.
There are also several different accreditation systems that have a
role in providing routes for verification and drivers for good quality
green infrastructure. These mostly provide voluntary mechanisms
to improve the delivery of multifunctional green infrastructure at a
variety of scales. Examples include Green Flag Award; Country Park
accreditation scheme; Building Research Establishment
Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM); Building for Life 12;
Building with Nature Award; Arcadis Sustainable Cities Index.

Integrating Green Infrastructure
into Well-Designed Places
3.1 Ten Characteristics of Well-Designed
Places
The National Planning Policy Framework makes it clear that the
creation of high-quality buildings and places should be
fundamental to the planning and development process. The
National Design Guide, the National Model Design Code (NMDC)
and Guidance Notes for Design Codes, illustrate how places that are
beautiful, healthy, greener, more biodiverse, enduring, and
successful, can be designed.
The National Design Guide considers how we recognise welldesigned places, by outlining and illustrating the Government’s
priorities in the form of ten characteristics.
These characteristics combine to create physical Character. The ten
characteristics help to nurture and sustain a sense of Community.
Although there are trade-offs, the characteristics can also positively
address environmental issues affecting Climate. They contribute
towards the cross-cutting themes for good design set out in the
National Planning Policy Framework.
The ten characteristics of well-designed places are listed below
and illustrated in Figure 3:
1. Context – enhances the surroundings.
2. Identity – attractive and distinctive.
3. Built form – a coherent pattern of development.
4. Movement – accessible and easy to move around.
5. Nature – enhanced and optimised.
6. Public spaces – safe, social, and inclusive.
7. Uses – mixed and integrated.
8. Homes and buildings – functional, healthy, and sustainable.
9. Resources – efficient and resilient.
10. Lifespan – made to last.
Green infrastructure is essential and integral to well-designed
places and should not be regarded as an optional enhancement.
Green infrastructure and its ecosystem functions are essential for
successful urban, or rural environments.
Table 1 shows how green infrastructure can contribute to the 10
characteristics of a well-designed place through delivering 12
ecosystem services.

3.2 Using Green Infrastructure Principles
in developing Local Design Codes
The National Model Design Code (NMDC) sets out three steps for
developing local design codes. The Green Infrastructure Principles
can support these three steps as set out below.
NMDC Steps Green Infrastructure How
Principles
a) Analysis of scope and
baseline
How 2: Evidence
How 3: Strategically planned
b) Vision How 1: Partnership and Vision
c) Codes How 4: Design
How 5: Managed, valued,
monitored, and evaluated
Table 2: The three steps of the National Model Design Code
a) Analysis of Scope and Baseline
The baseline should consider topography, geology, soils, ecology,
river and waterways, flood risk, landscape character, including the
wider area, and local distinctiveness, soundscape character; open
space and green infrastructure, local character, heritage, and
cultural assets, including conservation areas and ancient and
veteran trees. It should understand the wider evidence base for the
benefits of green infrastructure assets; and data on environmental,
social, and economic challenges and needs in the area that green
infrastructure could help to address.
Relevant information to consider in this baseline is:
• Local plan evidence and policies, including Biodiversity Net
Gain and other green infrastructure policies
• Local Nature Recovery Strategies
• Green Infrastructure Strategies
• Tree and Woodland Strategies
• Surface Water Management Plans
• Local Resilience Forum Community Risk Registers
• Wildfire Management Plans
• Drainage and Wastewater Management Plans
• Flood Risk Management Plans
• National and local landscape characterisation studies
• Mapping of inequalities in green infrastructure provision
and its benefits
• Natural Capital Atlases
b) Vision
Work in partnership with stakeholders from the outset to co-plan
and develop a vision for green infrastructure in the area as a whole
and for different area types or for a masterplan. Engage a diverse
and inclusive range of people and organisations including citizens, 
Page 28 of 138
local authorities, developers, communities, landowners, green
space managers, environmental, health, climate, transport, and
business sector representatives.
The vision should consider the quantity and quality of
green
infrastructure, and how it will function as a key asset to meet needs
and to deliver local strategy and policy, at all scales. It should
consider how to address inequalities in
green infrastructure
provision and its benefits
.
c) Codes
To integrate
green infrastructure into individual development or
area
-wide design codes, refer to the following chapters:
• Information on the building blocks of
green infrastructure
(Chapter 4)
.
• Information on designing
green infrastructure to deliver
multiple functions (Chapter 5)
.
• Information on designing
green infrastructure in different
area types (Chapter 6)
.
Good governance, funding, management, monitoring, and
evaluation of
green infrastructure should be designed in from the
outset and should consider how communities can be engaged in
stewardship where appropriate.
More detailed guidance on how to take a strategic approach to
planning green infrastructure is set out in Natural England’s Process
Journey for Local Planning Authorities.

Chapter 4: The Building Blocks of
Green Infrastructure 
Page 30 of 138
The Building Blocks of Green
Infrastructure
4.1 Introduction
The Green Infrastructure Principles (See Chapter 2) state that good
green infrastructure should be multi-functional, varied, connected,
accessible where possible, and respond to local character.
This chapter describes the different green infrastructure ‘building
blocks’ that form part of a varied network, and the functions they
perform. It sets out the important factors to consider when
planning and designing each element.
Before looking in more detail at the building blocks of green
infrastructure it is important to consider the context for each one.
4.2 Responding to local character
The distinctive character of places helps people to recognise and
form meaningful and mutually beneficial connections with the
environment where they live and work. ‘Landscape character’
embraces topographic features, geodiversity, wildlife and habitats,
land use, sights, sounds, touch and smells, cultural associations,
history, and memories. Understanding how the landscape is
perceived, experienced, and valued by people is critical in planning
and designing new green infrastructure and integrating existing
green infrastructure assets like parks.
Before considering which building blocks of green infrastructure
are incorporated into a scheme, it is important to take steps, in
consultation with stakeholders, to identify valued elements in the
local landscapes, and how places have changed over time, to
ensure that new green infrastructure responds to a place
appropriately. This requires taking account of information about
local landscape and soundscape character and key characteristics,
which can be found, for example, in: national character area
profiles; local landscape character assessments, conservation area
appraisals; World Heritage Site inscriptions; archaeological
records; local listings and townscape character assessments;
historic townscape assessments; green infrastructure and green
space strategies; park management plans; socio-economic data;
geodiversity action plans; noise action plans and noise important
areas.
The green infrastructure approach to ‘conserving character’ is not
only concerned with preserving or maintaining character, but also
to manage change that brings about benefits that society and local
communities value. ‘Enhancement’ is about taking opportunities to
improve an area’s character by strengthening existing
characteristics or introducing appropriate new features. In World
Heritage Sites, National Parks, Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty
and along Heritage Coasts, additional character considerations may
apply.
In many cases, a mix of approaches will be appropriate. It is
important that the feasibility of each intervention is considered in
relation to the practical functions required of the landscape. There
should be discussions with stakeholders on constraints and, along
with what they currently value about the landscape, how it has
evolved over time and how it might change. For example, options 
Page 31 of 138
considered may focus on the creation of a new, high-quality
landscape in an area that has become degraded. In contrast, where
the sense of place has been weakened by the losses, including
characteristic features in the surrounding built environment, then
the objective may be the restoration of historic character. New
development should be responsive to local character and the
historic environment, historic built environment, archaeology,
ancient and veteran trees and landscape character.
4.3 Building Blocks
This section describes the different ‘Building Blocks’ of green
infrastructure including:
• sustainable drainage systems,
• green and blue roofs,
• green walls,
• rain gardens,
• swales,
• features for species,
• trees in hard landscapes,
• street furniture and utility structures,
• traffic-free routes,
• allotments,
• orchards,
• private domestic gardens,
• green spaces (including parks and burial grounds),
• more natural spaces (including woodlands, grassland,
scrub, and hedgerows),
• heritage features and the historic environment,
• blue spaces (including wetlands).
It’s important to note that green infrastructure may be required as a
statutory obligation to mitigate project impacts, to deliver
mandatory Biodiversity Net Gain or other national or local policy
requirements. In these circumstances, certain habitats, features or
functionality may be required.
All organisations involved in the planning, design and delivery of
green infrastructure must collaborate to identify the types of green
infrastructure that will best provide the required functions or
benefits, and to ensure that the building blocks work together to
form a multifunctional interconnected network. All Green
infrastructure features can form part of the national Nature
Recovery Network, which is part of the Government’s 25 Year
Environment Plan. See Chapter 5 for the different functions of green
infrastructure and Chapter 6 for how green infrastructure comes
together in different area types.
It is important to note that some of the interventions described may
be unsuitable in certain situations. Research may identify
constraints, and collaboration with specialists may be required. For
example, green roofs can only be retrofitted where an engineer has
confirmed that a building has sufficient structural capacity to take
the additional weight; green infrastructure has the potential to
impact on the character of historic buildings and specialist advice
should be sought; sustainable drainage and tree planting which 
Page 32 of 138
involves excavations may not be appropriate where below-ground
archaeology or utilities occur.
4.4 Sustainable drainage systems
Sustainable drainage systems (SuDS) can include green roofs, blue
roofs, rainwater harvesting systems, rain gardens, modified tree
pits, swales, basins, ponds, wetlands, and other features, modified
to store water and slow the flow. SuDS provide an alternative or
addition to conventional drainage systems that rely on pipes and
the rapid conveyance of rainwater to drains and watercourses.
SuDS originates from the Low Impact Development approach,
which began in the United States in the 1990s. In the UK, with
increasing interest in these practices, CIRIA published its first SuDS
Manual in 2007. The Flood and Water Management Act 2010 (as
amended) uses the term sustainable drainage and the National
Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) has a policy that major
developments should incorporate sustainable drainage systems
unless there is clear evidence that this would be inappropriate.
The SuDS philosophy (as set out in CIRIA’s SuDS Manual 2015) is to
consider the quantity of water, the quality of water, and
improvements to amenity and biodiversity, however there is a
tendency for some practitioners to prioritise the reduction of flood
risk, neglecting a comprehensive approach that delivers multiple
benefits. Considering volumes alone, results in an overreliance on
features that detain water (for example underground tanks or large
ponds or basins) and the omission of a dispersed array of sourcecontrol features, including, for example, green roofs or rain
gardens.
Another issue that will become increasingly important in urban
areas is the storage of water in soils that can continue to support
vegetation during drought, and which can provide evaporative
cooling during heatwaves (conditions that are predicted to be more
frequent with climate change). The objective of storing more water
in soils is compatible with the SuDS objectives of infiltrating
rainwater and slowing the flow of surface water.
Looking at the wider landscape and the integration of a catchmentbased approach, there will be an increasing effort in using SuDS to
reduce downstream flooding, strengthen Green infrastructure
networks and assist with the recovery of nature. This means that
interventions can work together and should also lead to landscapescale projects that require more coordination between authorities
and landowners.
The SuDS approach promotes a management train (or treatment
train) for surface water. This involves a succession of features and
connections (conveyances), taking surface water from source
control features (e.g., green roofs, rainwater harvesting tanks and
permeable paving) to site control features (e.g., rain gardens or
small ponds) to regional control features (e.g., large ponds,
wetlands, or detention basins), before sending water to
watercourses. The building blocks of green infrastructure,
described in the paragraphs that follow, include source control
features, which should all individually be designed for amenity and
biodiversity as well as their capacity to handle water. Source control
features should be prioritised over site or regional controls to
maximise overall effectiveness and minimise land take. The
enhancement of biodiversity should be considered in all projects.
Page 33 of 138
For example, green roofs (source control features), which tend to be
shallow and often have a low plant diversity, should, wherever
feasible, have a greater depth of substrate (to store more water) and
should support a wider range of plant species (to increase
biodiversity). Rain gardens should be as large as is practically
possible. Where space is available, trees planted in hard landscapes
can have larger pits than usual, designed to store, and clean surface
water. Green space can be re-configured to temporarily detain
water following exceptional rainstorms, thereby improving surface
water management as well as providing an opportunity to improve
the parks or grounds where these features are located.

4.5 Green roofs and blue roofs
Green roofs (also known as living roofs) are roofs, decks, balconies,
or terraces where vegetation or habitat is deliberately established.
The German Landscape Research, Development and Construction
Society (FLL), and the Green Roof Organisation (GRO) Code of
Practice 2021, divides green roofs into two major categories:
intensive and extensive. These terms refer to the intensity of
maintenance required.
Intensive green roofs
Intensive green roofs (commonly known as roof gardens) are
usually formal landscapes and are usually irrigated. They require
frequent maintenance. Soils on roofs (known as substrates) are
normally artificial, lightweight blends of material. Intensive green
roof substrates are relatively deep (typically greater than 200mm).
With intensive green roofs, the primary consideration in the
conventional approach is amenity, which means that the planted
area may not be as biodiverse as it could be. More attention can be
made towards adopting a wildlife gardening approach, with native
species and non-native species with a documented value for
wildlife. Also, the balance between areas of paving and planting,
with paving often the dominant surface, can result in the loss of
ecosystem services and a reduction in the Urban Greening Factor.
Where feasible, increasing substrate depth is good for absorbing
rainfall and providing evaporative cooling.


Plate 1: Intensive green roof (roof garden). Credit: Green
Infrastructure Consultancy
Extensive green roofs
Extensive green roofs are usually vegetated with low-growing,
drought-tolerant vegetation such as stonecrops (Sedum species)
and dry meadow vegetation. They have a relatively shallow buildup of substrate, and typically vary in depth between 40mm and
150mm (although, to comply with the GRO Code 2021, they should
have a substrate depth of not less than 80mm). They are low
maintenance and not usually irrigated (except, on occasion, during
establishment). With extensive green roofs, which are usually
designed to be lightweight and low maintenance, there can be
issues associated with insufficient depth of substrate (or in some
cases sedum mats with no substrate beneath). This limits the 
Page 36 of 138
capacity of the roof to absorb water and to provide evaporative
cooling. Sedum mats are also of limited value for biodiversity. An
extensive green roof vegetated with many species of wildflowers is
nearly always preferable to a sedum roof in terms of biodiversity
value.

Building, Cambridge. Credit: Green Infrastructure Consultancy

Biodiverse extensive green roofs
Biodiverse extensive green roofs are designed to provide a
particular native vegetation type or habitats for wildlife. These
green roofs typically have slightly deeper soils than stonecropbased extensive green roofs, may have varying substrate depth and
a higher diversity of plant species. They often include habitat
features, for example sand piles, stacks of dead wood or stones (see
BugLife: Creating green roofs for invertebrates 2012).
Brown roofs
Brown roofs are designed to replicate the open-mosaic
communities on brownfield sites and a typical approach to their
establishment is to allow natural colonisation on a range of
substrates. Experience has shown that slow colonisation, the use of
unsuitable substrates that dry out too quickly, the risk of using
recycled materials that are contaminated and colonisation by
invasive species, mean that this approach is no longer
recommended.
Biosolar roofs
A biosolar roof is an extensive green roof that is combined with
photovoltaic (PV) arrays. Ideally, the green roof substrate ballasts
the frames, to which the PVs are attached. Recent research shows
that the combination of green roofs and PVs results in greater
efficiency of the PVs. This is because the efficiency of the PVs falls
when they overheat, and this negative effect can be reduced by
evaporative cooling provided by the green roof. New
configurations of PVs and green roofs are being developed, which
means that this is a typology that is likely to change rapidly.

Designers should consider a range of options before choosing a
supplier.

Blue roofs
A blue roof is a roof that has been designed to attenuate and store
rainwater, thereby acting as a source-control feature in the
sustainable drainage management train. A blue roof can be
combined with a green roof (sitting below a green roof and
irrigating the substrate through capillary action). Another, less
common, approach to creating a blue roof, is to create an
ephemeral wetland on a green roof. Blue roofs are a relatively new
phenomenon and designers should follow the development of new
approaches. Products are on the market, with advice available on
design, and guidance is currently being prepared by CIRIA.
4.6 Green walls
Green walls can be divided into green façades (climbing plants) and
living walls (intensive green wall systems that are composed of
textiles, modules, pockets, or troughs). This is another fastdeveloping area, and new techniques and products are under
development. Note that it may not be appropriate to vegetate the
façades of historic buildings. Any attachments to external walls,
including green walls, should be considered as part of a fire risk
assessment and specialist advice on fire risk should be sought.

Page 38 of 138
Green façades
Green façades are the traditional green walls where climbing plants
are rooted into the ground or into planter boxes. Climbing plants
may be grown directly onto the building façade or be trained
against wires or trellises. Green façades may take some time to
mature. Irrigation may not be necessary where plants are rooted
into the ground. Maintenance requirements are low. It is important
to take account of aspect and shade when choosing plants.
Living walls
Living walls are proprietary systems, often installed and maintained
as a package. Textile, plastic, and metal modules are used to provide
pockets, boxes or troughs that support plants. Some systems are
substrate-based whilst others are hydroponic (without soil), with
water held in the living wall by fabrics, mineral wool, or foam. Living
walls are usually irrigated, normally with the use of pumps that are
activated by timers. There are also examples of passive living walls
(or vertical rain gardens) where water wicks into planters from tanks
that collect rainwater.
Living walls can work well where high visual impact or highly
diverse planting is sought, or where high evaporative cooling is an
objective. Maintaining intensive green walls can be expensive,
because several maintenance visits each year are recommended
and specialist access equipment may be required. Monitoring of
irrigation is advised, so that prompt action can be taken to rectify
faults or interruptions in water supply. Green façades that use
climbing plants may be more suitable if there are constraints on
resources or management regimes cannot be assured in the long
term.

Infrastructure Consultancy
4.7 Rain gardens
Rain gardens are relatively small, planted areas designed to receive
rainwater flowing from paved surfaces or from drainpipes. In its
simplest form, a rain garden is a shallow depression, partially filled
with absorbent, yet free draining soil (usually a mixture of coarse
sand, grit, and organic matter) and planted with vegetation that can
withstand temporary inundation. Rain gardens are designed to
intercept and slow the flow of water that might otherwise directly
enter conventional drains. The microbes in the soil break-down 
Page 39 of 138
pollutants. Water enters the rain garden and infiltrates into the soil,
to be taken up by plants and released back into the air through
evapo-transpiration. Depending on the permeability of the subsoil, and the underlying geology, a certain proportion of the water
entering a rain garden may percolate into the ground. Once full, and
depending on the topography, rain gardens may overflow into
other rain gardens, rills, channels, swales or into the conventional
drainage system.
When designing rain gardens, it is important to consider any
constraints such as below-ground utilities and archaeology, as well
as how water will drain away once storage capacity is exceeded.
Raised planters, planter boxes, stormwater planters, or SuDS
planters, which receive water directly from a downpipe are also
sometimes described as rain gardens. The inlet of a rain garden may
be armoured to prevent erosion. The most water-tolerant plants
should be located near the inlet or in the lowest part of the rain
garden and plants that can tolerate both wet and dry conditions
elsewhere. Planting a rain garden presents an opportunity to
increase biodiversity by using native species or non-native species
that attract pollinators. For suggestions on planting for rain
gardens, see the Rain Garden Guide.
Bio-retention strips or bioswales, designed to receive the polluted
run-off from roads, are also sometimes described as rain gardens.
These may include gravel layers, perforated under-drains and
overflow drains. For advice on the planning and detailed design of
these and other SuDS components see the CIRIA Susdrain website.

4.8 Swales
A swale, in the context of sustainable drainage, is a shallow channel
designed to store and convey surface water runoff. If the gradient
is suitable, swales may include stop logs or check-dams designed to
slow the flow. Inlets and outlets and other places that are subjected
to high flow rates, that could cause erosion, may need to be
armoured. On permeable ground, where the underlying geology is
suitable, water may also infiltrate. A swale can also remove
pollutants. This may be valuable where water is to be discharged
into a natural waterbody. Adequate space should be made available
to ensure that bioremediation objectives are met. Swales are often 
Page 40 of 138
damp, particularly in the lowest part, but have a range of soil
conditions, which mean that they can support a high diversity of
plants. The vegetation in a swale is often lightly managed, with
plants being allowed to grow tall and provide visual interest. Plants
should be selected that can withstand periods of drought. With
most low-maintenance swales, it is advisable to establish
vegetation by seeding with a variety of native species, including
wetland, wet grassland, and dry grassland mixtures, chosen
according to the local setting and conditions and predictions of
how often the swale will convey water. Plantlife provides advice on
selecting suppliers of native wildflower seed.

4.9 Features for species
It is now commonplace for landscapes to include features designed
to benefit certain species or groups, for example nesting boxes for
birds, roosting and hibernation boxes for bats, hibernacula for
reptiles and amphibians, and refuges or micro-habitats for
invertebrates. Passages, ducts, and structures that enable animals
to crossroads, fences and other barriers are also used, usually as
mitigation for impacts identified during the planning stage for
projects. In the freshwater aquatic environment and in coastal
locations, refuges and shelters for fish and aquatic invertebrates
are also being installed.
The loss of natural habitats results in the loss of places for species
to feed, shelter and reproduce. The loss of large trees, standing and
fallen dead wood and natural exposures of soil and rocks means
that hole-nesting or roosting species have suffered declines. The
provision of artificial refuges and nesting and roosting boxes can
mitigate for the losses of the natural features. It should be noted,
however, that it is always preferable, wherever possible, to retain
existing natural habitats and features.
The selection of features will depend on the location and setting,
species that occur in the area and species to be targeted. This will
range from common and widespread species to declining species
and groups like house sparrow, hedgehog, and mining bees. Which
species to target will be informed by the Local Nature Recovery
Strategy and action plans for species. For barriers that need to be
crossed, especially roads, affected species and suitable mitigation
measures will be identified through the ecological impact
assessment process or the mapping of opportunities to benefit 
Page 41 of 138
certain species. Note that features for species do not currently
contribute towards Biodiversity Net Gain, which is based on
habitats.
Plate 9: Invertebrate refugium. Credit: Green Infrastructure
Consultancy
There can be issues with the procurement, installation, and
monitoring of features for species. This includes a lack of
knowledge of the life cycle of the species targeted, which can mean
the selection of unsuitable boxes (e.g., with incorrect hole sizes for
the species targeted) or boxes or refuges installed in unsuitable
locations with too much or too little exposure to the elements). It is
important that advice is sought from suitably qualified and
experienced specialists about the species to be targeted, the best
choice of feature (including materials), where it should be installed
and what techniques, if any, are used to attract the target species to
the feature. Most installations will require maintenance and the
resources and responsibility for this will need to be considered,
along with means of safe access. Some features (including for
example boxes for hole-nesting birds) are well-proven, whilst some
refuges (including for invertebrates and aquatic life) are less well
studied, so the monitoring of effectiveness is valuable.
Bricks with a hole that do not conflict with building insulation
requirements, can be good for a range of species including house
sparrows, tree sparrows, swifts, starling, and bats. The selection and
installation of integral nest boxes for birds should follow BS42021
(Integral nest boxes). A ledge under the eaves, can provide nesting
space for species such as house martin. Recovering insect
populations will be important alongside such measures. Many
pollinating insects are vital to the provision of ecosystem services
and are important food sources for birds and bats.
Plate 8: Swift brick. Credit: Dick Newell, Action for Swifts
Page 42 of 138
Pollinators can be provided for in many ways, for example by
installing bee bricks on south-facing walls where there is a pollen
source nearby.
The field is changing rapidly, with new products and research,
therefore reference should be made to organisations providing
advice on each group, including for example the British Trust for
Ornithology, the Bat Conservation Trust, and Buglife, amongst
others. In addition, authoritative peer-reviewed evidence, is
available on artificial refuges and breeding sites for a range of
groups and species. See for example the journal Conservation
Evidence. Note that it may not be appropriate to add features for
species to historic buildings – permission may be required.
4.10 Trees in hard landscapes
Street trees and trees planted into paved areas are a mainstay and
key component of urban greening. The conventional approach has
been to plant trees for aesthetic reasons, and while that will
continue to be an important consideration, it is now widely
accepted that trees are important for a wide range of functions
including summer shade and cooling, sequestering carbon,
improving air quality, providing habitat for wildlife, and helping to
reduce flood risk.
The size, configuration and make-up of tree pits is an important
factor in helping trees to thrive, as well increasing their ability to
absorb and store surface water and therefore improve resilience to
drought. This can involve the use of amended and structural soils
(e.g., Stockholm method) and soil cells (products that maintain free
draining and well aerated soils). It is important that trees are planted
into the ground in generously sized pits and that tree plantings are
Plate 10: Street trees with planted surrounds. Credit: Green
Infrastructure Consultancy
Page 43 of 138
integrated into sustainable drainage systems wherever feasible. It is
recommended that the diversity of species planted is increased, to
increase biodiversity, reduce vulnerability to the risk of disease and
increase resilience in the face of climate change. Tree species
should be carefully selected to be responsive to landscape and
historic character and to suit the planting location (see Right Tree in
the Right Place for a Resilient Future by Forest Research).
Considerations include the eventual size of the tree, its attributes
and benefits and local conditions, both below and above ground.
For advice on how to plant and manage trees that are within the
curtilage of the highway, see Operations Note 051 provided by the
Forestry Commission.
It is important that adequate volumes of suitable soil are provided
for tree roots to grow into. This means that load-bearing substrates
or soil cells should be used (see illustrations), and pits should be
expanded in to trenches wherever possible. Space should be
allowed for future growth of roots and trunk and account should be
taken of the species used. Street trees often require protective
guards and need to be anchored or supported during
establishment. It is also vital that street trees are watered during hot
and dry weather, especially during the first two years following
planting. Making space for both trees and utilities is critical, with
advice provided by the National Joint Utilities Group.
When selecting locations for tree planting, careful consideration
should be given to how the street is used and to ensure that the
movement of people, including those in wheelchair and
pushchairs, is not obstructed. Surfacing schemes should allow for
changes in level around trees as they grow and the ground settles.
Unnecessary felling should be avoided, and the Forest Commission
provides advice on how to address this issue, through the
Figure 5: Engineered tree pits - Stockholm type
Figure 6: Engineered tree pits - soil cell
Page 44 of 138
Joint Mitigation Protocol. For further information on tree selection
and planting see Right Tree, Right Place, for information on planting
trees in hard landscapes see Forest Research, and the Trees and
Design Action Group guidance. Reference should also be made to
the Government’s Manual for Streets.
4.11 Building fabric, furniture, and utility
structures
The urban environment includes utilitarian structures associated
with provision of services or storage. Examples include bollards,
railings or security barriers protecting pedestrians or buildings
from vehicles, cycle and bin stores, bins, kiosks, cabinets, poles for
power and communications and seating. It is possible to vegetate
many of these features – examples include planted hostile vehicle
barriers, as well as bus stops, sub-stations, bin stores and cycle
stores. Biodiversity should be a consideration, with diverse planting
of drought-tolerant native species and other suitable non-native
species with a documented value for wildlife. Other examples
include streetlights and railings being used as supports for planters.
When vegetating street furniture and utility structures, it is
important that adequate growing media, light, water and is
provided, that the planting is suitable and that biodiversity is
considered, as well as aesthetics and maintenance. Techniques
used to vegetate walls and roofs will be applicable.
It may also be possible to include features for species, including
nest and roost boxes and refugia for invertebrates on suitable
locations (see section 6.5). Some structures may also have
associated parking spaces or driveways and it may be possible to
vegetate these whilst maintaining vehicular access, using for
example, permeable, durable and vegetated surfaces like Austrian
gravel lawns. The integration of vegetation and features for wildlife
onto street furniture and utility structures is a relatively new
phenomenon and new products and insights are likely to emerge.

Roof Shelters
Page 45 of 138
The fabric of buildings and street furniture often reflects local
geodiversity. Locally sourced stone can be used to reinforce
character and engage people with geology.
4.12 Traffic-free routes
Traffic-free routes include footpaths, cycle paths, and bridleways.
These are often shared surfaces. Although these routes tend to be
narrow (public footpaths are typically 1.5m and shared routes 3m
wide) they can be part of important connectors in the wider Green
infrastructure network, and being traffic-free, they can be
relatively tranquil. Although the paths themselves are usually
surfaced and unvegetated in urban settings, these routes often
have vegetated shoulders (typically 1m wide) which are
occasionally mown. There are sometimes opportunities to use
canals, redundant railway infrastructure or industrial sites to create
new traffic-free routes. There may be opportunities to bring
geodiversity and industrial heritage into the design by, for example,
revealing rock outcrops or including sculptures that use local
materials or by displaying redundant industrial equipment.
Traffic-free routes can often be enhanced through the planting of
trees, which provide habitat and create shade to encourage people
to use cycle paths during hot weather. Care should be taken to
provide adequate space for roots to spread without damaging
surfaces. There may also be opportunities to include sustainable
drainage features, that may also be valuable habitats (e.g., swales)
as well as pocket parks for rest and play. Verges can be enhanced
through changes in mowing regime or in some cases, re-seeding to
become wildflower meadows on verges.

4.13 Orchards
Orchards are places where trees or shrubs are planted and
maintained for food production. There is resurging interest in
planting community orchards, with hundreds established during
the last decade. Community orchards can be a way of bringing
people in the local community together and regenerating
underutilised spaces. Orchards help people to discover the
pleasures of growing and eating organic fruit (apple is the most
common fruit) and pressing fruit juice and cider. Orchards can be
pleasant places to meet and relax, acting as a local park.
Plate 13: Bridport Community Orchard. Credit: Green Infrastructure
Consultancy
The traditional orchard is a priority habitat and can be of historic
importance. Community orchards can also help safeguard rare
varieties of fruit tree. When planning a new orchard, it is important
to find a sheltered site with enough sunlight and sufficient depth of
soil. Sites with standing water or sites prone to frost should be
avoided. Gently sloping sites are favoured. For more information on
how to create and conserve community orchards see the
Government’s guide.
4.14 Allotments and urban food growing
Allotments are food growing sites where people rent a small plot,
usually from their local council or an association that manages the
site on behalf of the landowner. There are also examples of
privately rented plots. In some districts, there are long waiting lists
for people to rent a plot, so the provision of new sites would
normally be part of a local authority green infrastructure strategy.
Well-designed allotments provide people an opportunity to grow
some of their own food, however they also promote an active
lifestyle and facilitate interaction with nature and other gardeners,
which improves mental health and wellbeing. Allotments are
increasingly being used as venues for green social prescribing.
Although the emphasis is on food growing, allotment sites usually
include lightly managed boundary planting, which can include
hedges and trees, and these can be a valuable part of the wider
green infrastructure network. There may also be opportunities to
include features in communal areas, including ponds and orchards.
In urban areas, there is increasing interest from community groups
and businesses to use underused places to grow food. By using
planters and raised beds, even small places that would normally be 
Page 48 of 138
unvegetated, including places with hardstanding or even roofs or
podiums, can become places for communities to gather, interact
and grow food.
Plate 14: Allotment. Credit: Green Infrastructure Consultancy
4.15 Private domestic gardens
There are opportunities for gardens in new development to be
designed as wildlife gardens with a variety of planting, including
native species and non-native species with value for wildlife. This
can include wildflowers, ponds, log piles and features for species
such as hedgehog highways (see 4.9). Advice is available on how to
attract wildlife to gardens.
Although the management of private domestic gardens is usually
outside of the scope of the local planning system, these areas can
strengthen the green infrastructure network and bring most of the
benefits associated with green infrastructure close to home. Private
domestic gardens make up a significant proportion of urban Green
infrastructure , covering 30% of the total urban area in England.
Gardens often combine to provide valuable links between other
categories of green infrastructure. Gardens with sealed surfaces,
including paving and artificial lawns, can exacerbate surface water
flooding problems, therefore it is important that soil, water, and
vegetation continue to be the dominant features. Gardens may also
include trees of amenity value or old or interesting specimens. The
value of these may be recognised through Tree Preservation Orders.
4.16 Green space
(For more on parks and green space see Chapter 6). Conventional
green spaces are often designed for amenity purposes and support
a range of informal recreation or more formal sport and
recreational uses. They are places where people meet, socialise,
relax, exercise, play sport and connect with nature, often daily.
Evidence shows that green spaces play an important role in
supporting physical and mental health and wellbeing.
Green spaces should be designed to meet the needs of the
communities that they serve, taking account of the requirements of
different cultural and social groups, ages, genders, neurodivergent 
Page 49 of 138
and disability needs. In any given neighbourhood it is good to have
a variety of different sizes and types of parks and green space, for
example pocket parks, doorstep green spaces and natural green
space, connected physically or functionally with other green
infrastructure as part of a network. Natural England’s Accessible
Green Space Standards (see Chapter 2 - which summarises the
Green Infrastructure Framework) sets out different size/distance
criteria for accessible green space.
Plate 15: Elephant Park, London. Credit: Lendlease
Parks and green spaces are often comprised of amenity grassland,
with scattered native and non-native trees, with shrubberies and
ornamental planted beds. Evidence shows that the visits and value
of green space are greater where there is a diversity of vegetation
types, including amenity grass, meadow, parkland, and woodland.
This diversity will also provide more opportunities for wildlife.
New green space should be designed to deliver a range of functions
as set out in Chapter 5. For example, there is often space for
significant SuDS features, including swales and ponds.
Trees and other planting in new and existing parks should be
diverse to increase biodiversity and resilience, with more use of
native species and non-native species with documented value for
wildlife.
In existing places, where tree planting is dense, the amenity grass
beneath can be shaded and poor quality. This can present an
opportunity to underplant trees with shade-tolerant woodland
shrubs and ground flora, or woodland edge flora, which can
increase biodiversity, improve surface water management, and
reduce the requirement for mowing.
Mowing can be reduced and delayed, giving time and space for
wildflowers to thrive (for example: see Plantlife’s ‘No Mow May’
campaign). Where short grassland is required, this can be more
species-rich, with low-growing wildflowers incorporated into the
sward.
Green space is often shaped by geodiversity and can include former
quarries. Incorporating geodiversity into the way green space is
designed and presented adds to the diversity of the site and the
richness of experience.
Page 50 of 138
4.17 Natural green space
Natural green spaces are places where human control and activities
are not intensive and there is a feeling of naturalness. Natural (often
called semi-natural) green space exists as a distinct type of green
infrastructure, but also as discrete areas, within most other green
space types.
Semi-natural areas can be found in our towns, cities, and
countryside. They may be designated, mostly as non-statutory
wildlife sites (sites of County-wide or City-wide importance) or they
may have a statutory designation such as Local Nature Reserve,
National Nature Reserve or Site of Special Scientific Interest. Some
may even have designations showing they are of international
importance. Both statutory and non-statutory designations are
identified in Local Plans.
Many natural green spaces in conurbations are managed as nature
reserves. These sites are often encapsulated countryside – places
that have survived as urban development has spread around them,
or they can be previously-developed sites (brownfields) that have
been colonised by flora and fauna after being abandoned. They can
include remnants of their former use, including for example, the
exposed rock faces of abandoned quarries. Some brownfield sites
have their origins in the industrial revolution and can have
significant cultural links to local communities. Other semi-natural
sites are associated with past and current transportation
infrastructure, particularly canals, railways, and major roads (see
Chapter 6, which looks at various area types). Many conurbations
are on rivers or coastal sites that may also be designated (see 4.18
Blue Space). Natural green spaces are often of historic importance
and may include archaeological sites.
These natural green spaces form core sites for biodiversity and
geodiversity in the wider green infrastructure network, sites from
which wildlife can expand its range and recolonise. Core sites
should be protected from development as key components of the
Nature Recovery Network. They should also be expanded wherever
possible, to create buffers that improve their condition, but also to
improve their ecological value. Core sites should also be
interconnected, directly through the establishment of ground level
corridors, such as hedgerows, green access routes, street trees, but
also functionally through patches (stepping-stones) that could
include habitats on buildings. This process is supported at the local
level by Local Nature Recovery Strategies, Green infrastructure
strategies and other strategies that encompass everything from
doorstep spaces and private gardens, to the wider countryside.
Natural green space can be incorporated into new development as
a mosaic, with a range of features such as small patches of bare
ground, tall flower-rich vegetation, scattered trees, scrub,
woodland, or wetland to support a range of species and their life
cycles. Many existing natural green spaces will have developed
naturally and so designs should include opportunities for natural
re-colonisation. Design should reflect local biodiversity priorities as
identified in the Local Nature Recovery Strategy. Sites should be
integrated physically and functionally with wider ecological
networks.
Most existing urban wildlife and geological sites would benefit
from enhancements and improvements in management.
Engagement with communities and interpretation panels and 
Page 51 of 138
communications to explain the importance of interventions can be
helpful to allay concerns.
When planning the establishment of habitats, it is important to
understand the landscape context and special site characteristics.
There may be opportunities and constraints, including the historic
environment, rare or protected species and existing habitats of
importance (e.g., species-rich grasslands, heathland, or wetlands).
Easements or corridors which provide access to utilities and
underground utilities must be avoided. Information on existing
historic and protected sites, habitats and species are available from
local environmental record centres, MAGIC, and Natural England’s
Green Infrastructure mapping database. Working with the site
characteristics such as soil type, geology and drainage can reduce
costs and help with establishment. Plans must be in place for
nurture, especially during establishment and long-term
stewardship of sites.
The establishment of woodland can involve planting, seeding or
natural colonisation. The most common approach is to plant native
tree and shrub species in natural associations. The Government and
NGOs, including, the Woodland Trust provide guidance on
woodland creation. There is increasing interest in using the
Miyawaki method for creating woodland, which involves planting
seedlings of native species at very high densities. Advocates of
natural regeneration of woodland argue that it is cost-effective and
results in healthier and more diverse woodlands.
Scrub consists of native shrubs and patches of open grassland,
from scattered bushes to closed canopy stands which develop into
woodland. Scrub is a very important habitat for invertebrates,
reptiles, amphibians, small mammals, and breeding birds. Ideally,
scrub includes a variety of woody and grassland species, of varying
heights, age, and structure. Scrub is usually established alongside
existing woodlands or hedgerows or as a buffer for a water body or
watercourse. The preferred method of creating scrub is to allow it
to develop naturally, however in some situations planting and
seeding may be appropriate – detailed advice on creating and
managing scrub is available from the RSPB.
Native hedgerows mark site boundaries, provide screening, reduce
soil erosion and are valuable wildlife habitats. They are an
important part of our cultural heritage. Hedgerows should be
planted with species found in existing nearby hedgerows. Local
Landscape Character Assessments will provide information about
the contribution that hedgerows make to the character of a local
area. Ecologists or the county Wildlife Trust may be able to advise
on the species mix. Usually, a mixture of native species is used, with
bare root stock planted in staggered, double rows.
Wildflower meadows are open habitats of permanent grassland,
maintained by cutting or grazing. Wildflower meadows are not to
be confused with beds seeded with cornfield or non-native
annuals, a treatment now popular along some town centre verges.
Wildflower meadows are best established where soil fertility is low.
Careful ground preparation is important, and sites should be
seeded with locally appropriate native species, suited to the soil
type. Seed must come from trusted sources. If local sources are
available, the spreading of green hay from a species-rich donor site
can be very successful. Effective cutting or grazing is essential, and
cuttings should be removed to maintain low fertility. Over time,
management may need to be adjusted to get better results.

Incorporating geological features often involves vegetation and
scrub management increasing both the visual and physical
accessibility of rock exposure with the further benefit of increased
habitat diversity. This can be particularly valuable for pioneer
vegetation communities and invertebrate species associated with
bare or more open ground.
4.18 Heritage features and the historic
environment
Our rich heritage of buildings and green spaces is often the
foundation of communities’ sense of identity, and in turn their
prosperity, confidence, social cohesion, and individuals’ wellbeing.
The public realm and the network of green and blue infrastructure
that surrounds and enables access to this heritage has a material
impact on the way in which any historic place is perceived, used,
and enjoyed.
Historic buildings and green spaces represent investment by past
generations and significant embodied carbon. Many features like
public parks have stood the test of time and proved to be adaptable
to meet the needs of successive generations whilst still retaining
their historic interest. Historic England encourages ‘constructive
conservation’, a positive, well-informed, and collaborative
approach. This flexible process uses an understanding of the
historic environment and its past stewardship to manage change.
Like new developments, climate adaptation, retrofit and naturebased solutions, and biodiversity measures can often be sensitively
incorporated into historic places and improve the experience for
local people and visitors. Past land and water management can
inform and guide new low carbon, nature-rich green infrastructure
approaches. There is scope for a wide range of measures from
improving accessibility of streets and green spaces, to providing
more shade and screening traffic and unsightly features, or
restoring historic features such as hedges and verges, and enriching
environments through better management, horticulture and
creating more space for wildlife. New green infrastructure should
be designed and maintained to both enhance the historic
environment and add new interest that will be valued by future
generations and prove to be a sustainable investment.
Character is one of the green infrastructure principles.
Understanding the history of a place, its green spaces and other
features like trees and wildlife habitats, and their development and 
Page 53 of 138
interrelationships, and wider landscape setting, is a key to that
character assessment. Every settlement, whether a medieval market
town or a post-war city centre, has a unique and distinctive history.
There are often many layers reflecting the interaction between
people and places through time whether ‘visible, buried or
submerged, or landscaped’6. The history and culture of a place
should be used as an inspiration for identifying opportunities for
new green infrastructure and its design. Historic England provides
advice and guidance on understanding places and historic
landscape and urban characterisation resources. Green
infrastructure designers and managers can also draw on the
expertise of local historic environment advisers and place making
professionals and resources such as Historic Environment Records.
The National Heritage List for England is the official, up to date,
register of all nationally protected listed buildings, scheduled
monuments, world heritage sites, protected wrecks, registered
parks and gardens, and battlefields. There are also local heritage
lists.
For those developing green infrastructure policies, the
Government’s Planning Practice Guidance includes a historic
environment section and Historic England also offer a range of
planning advice on plan-making and decision-taking, and other
6 NPPF definition of historic environment ‘All aspects of the environment
resulting from the interaction between people and places through time,
including all surviving physical remains of past human activity, whether visible,
issues which are important in good decision-making affecting
heritage assets.

Heritage is a great springboard to engage with people and get them
involved in designing, planning, and looking after green
infrastructure features such as parks, and in doing so socialise and
buried or submerged, and landscaped and planted or managed flora’.

bond, and revitalise and enrich their local culture. Evidence shows
that local parks and green spaces are important features, so too the
buildings and industrial heritage, in people’s sense of pride about
their place. However, although parks and green spaces are loved
they are often overlooked as heritage perhaps because they are
civic assets still very relevant in day-to-day lives rather than relics
from the past. The public parks, gardens, squares, town walks and
cemeteries of national special historic interest are included in the
Register of Parks and Gardens and there many more stories to reveal
about the history of parks and recreation grounds in every town.
By their nature and construction, historic buildings and sites often
provide valuable and scarce habitat for wildlife such as roosts for
bats and nesting sites for swifts, and old masonry for wall flora and
insects. The coexistence of nature and art in cemeteries and old
burial grounds are an example of notable combined historic,
cultural and natural resources in towns and cities. Other features
like old fruit trees, veteran trees and some habitats survive as
vestiges from past countryside now locked into the urban fabric.
Through good horticulture, features such as flower borders can be
valuable nectar and seed sources and offer an extended season of
food sources for insects and birds as well as enrich visitors’
experience. Historic sites and streetscapes often include mature
non-native trees, as well as native species. These may prove to be
important in the future urban treescapes as climate changes.
Researchers are interested in historic tree collections to understand
potential future tree species selection for urban environments.
Trees and landscaping are likely to be distinct to the period of town
development. Such treescapes often shape the character of areas
and the amenity designation, Conservation Area includes
protection for trees for this reason. Changes in design or
management can unwittingly undermine local character and may
even lead to exposing historic buildings and landscapes to new
risks.
There a myriad of other historic features such as shrubberies,
hedges, lakes and ponds, that contribute to the green infrastructure
or add to the multifunctionality of green infrastructure such as
bandstands and entertainment venues, associated museums and
galleries, cafes and toilets, park benches and street furniture,
promenades and paths, and play and sports facilities. The history of
some sports is rooted in local public parks and greens spaces and
the culture of their communities.
The management of waterways whether rivers or man-made
features like canals has a long history that may include industrial
heritage as well as designed landscaping that needs to be respected
in integrated river management projects.
Maintenance of historic buildings and landscapes is vital both to
their conservation and improved performance as infrastructure.
Management plans for sites and places such as Conservation Areas
are encouraged to tease out their significance and determine how
best to look after them and plan maintenance, conservation, and
repair. Plans for historic parks and other green spaces look at sites
in the round and their multifunctionality including biodiversity
interest, environmental sustainability and more recently climate
change adaptation and can help work out green infrastructure
priorities based on needs. Site plans should nest within green space
strategies and in turn green infrastructure strategies.
There is often scope to integrate new green infrastructure,
sustainable urban drainage, and habitat areas too and a historic 
Page 55 of 138
character-led approach should be used to identify locations and
shape designs and maximise the benefits. Carefully sited lowcarbon energy schemes such as water or ground sourced heat
pumps in lakes could be installed to power nearby buildings. There
are hundreds of examples of micro-solar panels already being used
to power small scale or remote installations such as car parking
ticket machines, lighting, and interpretation. Listed buildings and
other historic buildings can be retrofitted with green infrastructure
features such as climbing plants to create green walls or flat roofs
converted to green roofs subject to the construction and fabric, and
historic interest of the building and its setting being taken into
account. Listed building or other heritage consents will be needed
and proposals should be discussed with the local authority
conservation officer at an early stage. Green wall vertical structures
designed to be attached or fixed to walls, and irrigation systems
may be problematic because of harm to the historic fabric. Tree
planting on, or rewilding of, scheduled monuments and other
archaeological features is not appropriate, and advice should be
sought about protecting them.
Historic England’s place making guidance offers more detailed
advice on works in sensitive historic locations and how to make
improvements to public spaces without harm to their valued
character, including specific recommendations for works to
surfaces, street furniture, new equipment, traffic management
infrastructure and environmental improvements.
4.19 Blue space
Blue infrastructure or blue space are terms used to describe places
where water is the key natural feature. Blue space includes
waterbodies, watercourses, rivers, canals, wetlands, ponds,
estuaries, the coast and the sea.

steel viaduct brought back into use as an urban sky park created by
and for the benefit of local people. Credit: Natural England
Water is often the reason for conurbations being situated where
they are, and blue spaces can be the most important and most
dominant green infrastructure features. Blue spaces are often the
setting for historic sites and features. Access to inland waterways,
waterbodies and coast is particularly valuable for health and
wellbeing. Wetlands and coastal habitats tend to store more carbon
than terrestrial habitats.

These habitats may be damaged by pollution, including that from
sewage overflows, agricultural runoff, and urban surface water runoff. Poor water quality reduces biodiversity in the aquatic
environment and makes waterbodies and watercourses unsafe
because of pathogens and algal blooms. Watercourses and
waterbodies may also be used as sources of drinking water and
poor water quality adds to the cost of treatment.
The margins of blue spaces can be damaged by artificial, hard
features and abrupt changes in topography (e.g., river walls),
resulting in the loss of ecotones (marginal aquatic habitats), which
are often important breeding and feeding sites for aquatic and
wetland wildlife. Small watercourses are often culverted or piped,
resulting in habitat loss, downstream flooding, and an increase in
pollution. Opportunities should be sought to restore rivers and to
soften the banks and walls that line waterbodies and watercourses.
Development in floodplains can result in the loss of habitat, the
flooding of property and an increase in downstream flooding, and
a flood risk assessment may be required.
Wetlands occur where soils become saturated with water, which
can be seasonal. Wetlands include salt marshes, mudflats, and
other coastal and estuarine features as well as inland features
including rivers and their floodplains, wet grasslands, fens, wet
woodlands (carr), lakes, reedbeds, peat bogs, ponds, and ditches.
On larger wetland sites intimate mixtures of wetland types may
occur. Artificial drainage and extraction of peat over the centuries
means that wetlands have largely disappeared from the landscape.
Now, as part of our efforts to improve river catchment
management, reduce flood risk and improve water quality,
networks of interconnected wetlands of multiple types and sizes
should be created or restored across both rural and urban areas.
The locations and types of wetlands will depend on the availability
and movement of water and ground conditions; however, it is often
possible to restore lost streams, rivers, ponds, and marshes, to
extend existing blue features, including the margins of rivers and
lakes and to restore coastal and estuarine habitats. This can involve
de-culverting and the restoration of more natural ground
conditions. The creation, restoration, planting and management of
wetlands is a specialised activity that requires understanding of
climate and predicted climate change, water level control, water
quality and ground modelling and the ecology of the various
wetland habitat types.
Planting of wetlands should always be undertaken using locally
appropriate native species in natural associations. Wetlands are 
Page 57 of 138
particularly vulnerable to being damaged by invasive non-native
aquatic plants and animals.
Plate 20: Urban wetland. Credit: Biodiversity by Design
Sustainable drainage systems (SuDS) can include wetland habitats
such as reed beds, swales, and small ponds. In urban areas it may
be possible to create mini wetlands at the individual property level,
such as small garden ponds to provide wellbeing and biodiversity
benefits where people live or work. Even small wetlands can
provide useful connections and stepping-stones, enabling wildlife
to move between larger habitats.
Improving the quality of runoff in catchments, particularly by using
SuDS, will be an important part of the effort to improve water
quality and green and blue infrastructure should be planned and
designed with this in mind.
Blue spaces are often linear features (for example, river valleys) and
these can provide opportunities to increase the network of cycle
paths, bridleways, and footpaths. With climate change bringing
about rises in sea levels and increasing the severity and frequency
of flooding along the coast and blue corridors, and the inevitable
associated need for changes to infrastructure, there will be
opportunities to create new wetland habitats (for wildlife and
carbon sequestration) and new access (particularly traffic-free
routes for horse-riders, pedestrians, and cyclists).
4.20 Natural play space
The emphasis in conventional playground design is to provide
places for physical activity, with the play space being an enclosed
location for manufactured play equipment. As a result of this, play
space tends to be devoid of vegetation and natural features and
unvegetated surfaces often dominate. This means that play space
does not usually provide the full range of benefits associated with
green infrastructure.
Exposure to nature, vegetation and soil has many benefits for
children and improves their development, health, and wellbeing.
This can include exercise that builds strength and stamina, social
interaction to improve wellbeing, and opportunities to interact
with and develop an interest in the natural world. Exposure to soil
microbes also benefits the immune system. These benefits have
been recognised and promoted by many organisations, including,
for example, the Forest Education Network, amongst others. Play
areas benefit from the incorporation of shade trees and 
Page 58 of 138
wildflowers, which can add stimulating textures and colours. The
fences associated with play areas often provide opportunities to
grow climbing plants.
Plate 21: Natural play space, RHS Wisley. Credit: Davies White/RHS
Natural features like logs and boulders can be used as an alternative
to manufactured play equipment. There are also opportunities to
provide features and gathering space that encourage exploration
and play in green space outside of designated play space. Play
space should be seen as an opportunity to provide SuDS and
biodiverse planting and it is also possible to include special
features for wildlife, including nesting and roosting boxes and
refuges for invertebrates. It is good practice to exclude dogs from
play areas and sports pitches.
Most facilities provided for teenagers are Multi Use Games Areas
(MUGAs) and skate parks, all with hard surfacing, and many spaces
are not inclusive. It is important that more spaces are provided that
are interesting but more inclusive. Comfortable seating and swings
where people face each other are particularly helpful in making
spaces suitable for teenage girls, and it will be particularly
important to make these spaces feel safe.

Infrastructure for Multiple

Designing Green Infrastructure
for Multiple Functions
5.1 Introduction
This chapter considers how green infrastructure should be
planned, designed, delivered, and maintained, to provide multiple
functions. The National Design Guide identifies ten desirable
characteristics of well-designed places - these cannot be achieved
without green infrastructure and associated ecosystems, which
provide the critically important functions that sustain people and
places. Green infrastructure is therefore integral to good design.
It is important to be aware of the full range of functions that green
infrastructure provides. It is also important to be mindful of the
multiple functions that a single green infrastructure design can
provide. Conventional approaches to green infrastructure design
often have specialists focusing on single objectives in what can be
a relatively simplistic approach, rather than working with nature to
achieve a balanced mixture of interacting features and benefits.
Projects can address the issues of biodiversity loss, climate change,
health and wellbeing, and deprivation, by providing multifunctional green infrastructure that is thoughtfully designed.
5.2 Ecosystem functions
Twelve ecosystem functions (see figure) are considered in turn in
the paragraphs that follow. There are the foundational functions of
nature (biodiversity, soil and geodiversity, and water), those most
associated with climate (carbon and energy, temperature
regulation), functions that help our health and wellbeing (access to
nature, food, active lifestyles, clean air, enhanced soundscapes),
and those associated with prosperous communities (including
education and sense of place, amongst others). Whilst there may be
drivers for individual functions, these individual functions will
often work together to deliver multiple benefits, and consideration
should be given to the full suite of benefits in a project, and how
they can work together.
Figure 8: Delivering multiple ecosystem functions through green
infrastructure
These functions will support the ten desirable characteristics in the
National Design Guide (see Table 1) and the five ‘Why’ Green 
Page 61 of 138
Infrastructure Principles either directly or indirectly, with some
functions making a stronger contribution than others. All the
functions are essential and must be considered as interconnected
and synergistic.
In some situations, the emphasis will be on protecting and restoring
natural features and processes and changing management to
increase biodiversity and wider functionality. In others, the
emphasis will be on retrofitting or creating new multi-functional
green infrastructure that is designed to meet the needs of the local
community and society.
There are a number of tools, such as the Environmental Benefits
from Nature Tool, that provide a common and consistent means of
considering the impact of development and land use change on
different ecosystem services or functions. Use of these tools can
help to enable better consideration of losses and gains in
ecosystem services from development.
The Building with Nature Award is built around themes of Core,
Wellbeing, Water and Wildlife and can provide formal independent
verification of high quality green infrastructure delivering multiple
benefits in development and planning policy.
The following sections set out the individual functions of green
infrastructure, however they will need to be considered in the
round to ensure that green infrastructure is designed to deliver
multiple benefits.
5.3 Biodiversity (including pollination)
Habitat loss and fragmentation are key causes of biodiversity
decline. Fragmentation happens when parcels of habitat are
destroyed, or significantly degraded, leaving behind smaller,
unconnected fragments. This damages ecosystems, reduces the
extent and quality of habitat, and reduces the ability of some
species to move through the landscape, which in turn can quickly
lead to inbreeding, loss of genetic diversity, and extinctions.
Fragmentation also reduces the resilience of populations to climate
change by cutting off potential migration pathways.
Well-designed green infrastructure can secure and buffer existing
high-quality habitats and provide expanded habitat networks by
reconnecting fragments of good quality habitats, thereby
enhancing biodiversity, providing ecosystem functions, and
making ecosystems more resilient. Addressing fragmentation
means maximising and linking together habitat along linear
infrastructure, including river valleys, waterways, roads, railways,
footpaths, and cycleways. It also involves finding ways of crossing
barriers (including for example busy roads) or providing steppingstones (for example green roofs, school grounds or pocket parks)
that allow species with limited ability to disperse to move through
hostile environments like the urban core.
Local Nature Recovery Strategies (LNRSs), as set out in the
Environment Act 2021, will help the public, private and voluntary
sectors work more effectively together for nature’s recovery. These
strategies will set priorities for nature’s recovery, map the most
valuable existing areas for nature (for habitats and species), and 
Page 62 of 138
develop specific proposals for creating or improving habitat for
biodiversity and wider environmental goals.
The habitats that are restored and created in the enlarged and
strengthened Nature Recovery Network will depend on the context
and setting, the land uses and developments within the area in
question and capacity to maintain natural assets and features.
Where large interconnected and ecologically degraded areas of
land are available (including former agricultural or industrial sites),
these can be restored to mosaics of woodland, scrub, wetland, and
grassland through planting or seeding of native species of local
provenance to reflect local character, or through natural
succession (see rewilding).
Where wetlands are being restored it may be necessary to modify
or restore watercourses. Reference to historic maps or lidar data
may be helpful in identifying routes. A catchment management
approach should be followed, whereby rainwater is held in the
green infrastructure network’s vegetation and soils, to improve
water quality and to reduce the risk of downstream flooding.
Where large-scale infrastructure is planned, there is the potential to
include features that strengthen the wider ecological network.
These could include tree belts or native hedgerows with associated
species-rich grassland verges. The objectives of increasing
biodiversity through diverse planting and improving the quality of
runoff that enters the aquatic environment must be added to the
traditional consideration of reducing the visual impact of large
infrastructure projects.
For large-scale development, masterplans should include green
infrastructure strategies that take account of connections with the
wider green infrastructure network, and which are fully
coordinated with surface water management plans and sustainable
drainage strategies. This will help to increase the likelihood of
creating interconnected matrices of vegetation, soil and water
which forms an improved setting and backdrop for the built
environment.
For the built environment (including buildings themselves) where
conventionally, the presence of soil, water and vegetation has not
been seen to be an essential component of the design, habitats can
be provided in the form of appropriately designed green roofs and
green walls as well as the more traditional urban parks, gardens,
and trees.

Page 64 of 138
The imperative to increase biodiversity means that planting should
be with native species, ideally growing in natural associations.
Where ornamental plantings are made, planting can include nonnative species with a documented value for wildlife.
Plants that benefit pollinating insects (including wild bees) should
also be used (see for example the Royal Horticultural Society’s
advice on Plants for Pollinators), as well as larval food plants, to
ensure that invertebrates like moths and butterflies can complete
their life cycles. Consider providing a diverse mix of native plants
(flower-rich grassland, green roofs and walls, shrubs, hedges, trees)
as well as structurally diverse vegetation for food, shelter and nest
sites including standing dead wood, old trees with cracked bark and
tree cavities. Consider leaving grass to grow longer before mowing
and removing arisings.
The structural diversity of vegetation (varying height, density, and
texture), exposed soils, standing and fallen deadwood, ponds and
rougher, denser, vegetation to provide cover and refuge for wildlife
should also be provided throughout the built environment. In
planning and design, an assumption should be made that
gardening for wildlife will become ordinary and routine. The
principles of gardening for wildlife should be followed, which
means finding out about habitats and wildlife in the area, providing
food, water, shelter, and breeding places for the targeted species
and avoiding the use of biocides.
Biodiversity Net Gain (BNG) is an approach which aims to leave
biodiversity and the natural environment in a measurably better
state when land use changes and when development occurs. BNG
is already a requirement in many local plans. BNG still relies on the
application of the mitigation hierarchy to avoid, mitigate, or
compensate for biodiversity losses. It is additional to these
approaches, not instead of them.
The Environment Act 2021 includes provisions that will make BNG
mandatory in England for most development types. The
Biodiversity Metric used to calculate biodiversity net gain includes
within it many common Green infrastructure habitat features, such
as SUDs, green roofs and walls etc and their inclusion in a scheme
design can contribute towards meeting BNG requirements.
Natural England’s Environmental Benefits from Nature tool is
designed to work alongside BNG to enable more detailed
consideration of wider environmental benefits for people and
nature. Further information on the links between BNG and Green
Infrastructure Standards is set out in Chapter 6.
5.4 Soils and geodiversity
Our landscapes and soils are strongly influenced by the underlying
geology. It is important that planning for Green infrastructure
recognises the opportunities and constraints associated with soils
and rocks and celebrates the local distinctiveness of character
areas, which are largely defined by geology. Understanding and
conserving geodiversity is critical to successful green infrastructure
design. For example, understanding underlying geology,
topography, and natural process are all critical in determining what
habitats work where, and how rivers, streams, and drainage
systems function. As well as natural outcrops, active and former
mineral workings, road and canal-side cuttings, and disused
railways often provide opportunities to conserve and enhance 
Page 65 of 138
geodiversity, benefiting biodiversity, and providing links to cultural
and industrial history.
The importance of soils is often underestimated or overlooked, and
poorly understood. Soil is a key component of green infrastructure.
Soils support agriculture (which supplies most of our food) and are
the basis of terrestrial ecosystems. They are intimately connected
with aquatic environments and the atmosphere. Soils store and
filter water, store carbon and can contain records of our ecological
and cultural past. Soils are complex ecosystems, derived from the
rocks and minerals where they occur, but are also composed of
plant roots and mycorrhizae, microbes, soil fauna, other organic
matter, water, and gases. Soil microbes remove pollutants and are
responsible for the cycling of nutrients.
Soils are being degraded through erosion (either by wind or water),
compaction, being sealed over or contaminated with heavy metals,
hydrocarbons, pathogens and microplastics. Soils can lose
nutrients, become too nutrient-rich or suffer from losses of soil
biodiversity. Eroded soils are deposited onto roads or washed into
watercourses or the sea. It is estimated that more than 2 million
tonnes of soil are eroded annually in the UK. These problems are
predicted to become worse with climate change, with heavy
downpours accelerating losses caused by runoff and droughts
drying soils and increasing wind erosion.
Green infrastructure includes soils, and these must be conserved to
protect existing biodiversity, geodiversity, and archaeological
deposits. Where soils are modified, they should be prepared so that
they support the habitats and sustainable drainage systems that are
created. Degraded soils should be modified so that they are less
compacted, and infiltrate and store more water.
Low nutrient soils are often preferable where species-rich grassland
is being established, and exposed rocks, skeletal or bare soils are
important habitats for some invertebrates (including for example
mining bees) and basking sites for reptiles. Free-draining and waterabsorbent soils are required for tree pits, rain gardens and green
roofs.
The use of topsoil should be limited to horticultural applications,
including food growing. Approaches used to replenish organic
material and nutrients in agricultural soils will not be suitable for
soils in most parts of the green infrastructure network. There is no
need to use imported, manufactured topsoil on road verges and
other infrastructure projects, particularly where the intention is to
establish woodland or species-rich swards. Avoiding the
unnecessary use of topsoil will reduce the carbon footprint and
cost of projects as well as helping to increase biodiversity. It will
also reduce the risk of introducing invasive non-native species to
sites.
There is interest in modifying soils to store carbon. This can include
the restoration of wetlands by re-wetting soils (wetlands are
particularly efficient at sequestering carbon) or the creation of
woodlands and species-rich grasslands. There is also interest in
burying biocharin soils, to store carbon and improve water storage,
drainage, and aeration.
There is insufficient data on the condition of our soils and better
monitoring is required. Soil surveys and investigations should be
commissioned when planning or designing large projects.
Engagement of suitable specialists, including soil scientists,
geoarchaeologists and geologists, alongside stakeholder 
Page 66 of 138
engagement, is therefore recommended. Geodiversity Action Plans
should be referred to.
Figure 10: Functioning soils. Credit: IUCN (Conserving Healthy Soils)
As part of the 25-year environment plan there are several measures
under development to improve and protect soil health in England.
This includes the Sustainable Farming Incentive scheme that
encourages sustainable approaches to farm husbandry that deliver
for the environment, improve and protect soil health and support
farm productivity. A range of soil monitoring measures are also
being developed to help land managers and farmers track the
health of our soil and the impact their management practices have
over time, encouraging more appropriate soil management
practices to be implemented.
5.5 Water
The water cycle (where precipitation falls onto the land, infiltrates
into soil and rocks, flows into watercourses and the sea, evaporates
into the atmosphere, and falls again) has been significantly
modified by human activities. Large-scale removal of habitats for
agriculture and urban development, has led to greater soil
compaction and has increased the area of sealed surfaces, both of
which have had the effect of drying out the landscape.
Watercourses have been straightened and rivers disconnected
from their floodplains. As a result of these changes, the risk of
flooding is increased, and freshwater and marine environments
have become more polluted.
To realise more benefits in terms of reductions in flooding and
improvements in water quality and biodiversity, green
infrastructure needs to be considered at a catchment (river basin)
scale. Integrated Catchment Management (ICM) involves the
participation of multiple organisations, landowners and managers
through a partnership approach.
Green infrastructure helps to reverse the effects of urbanisation by
reducing the extent of sealed surfaces, thereby allowing more
water to infiltrate into soils. This is the sponge effect, which slows
the flow and improves the quality of water that enters the aquatic
environment. The risk of downstream flooding is decreased, and
biodiversity is increased in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.
Page 67 of 138
In upland and rural areas, the sponge effect can be increased
through the restoration of damaged or lost peatlands. In suitable
locations, woodland can be re-established. Such schemes also store
carbon in re-wetted soils and woody vegetation. Natural Flood
Management (NFM) techniques can be used, including the
installation of large woody debris barriers (leaky dams) across
woodland streams. This can also be achieved through the reintroduction of beavers, which build dams that slow the flow, trap
sediments and increase the area of wet woodland and other
wetland habitats. Where farming continues, practices can be
modified to slow runoff, for example through contour ploughing,
by damming gullies, by planting hedges and trees belts across
slopes or by modifying grazing regimes.
Most rivers and watercourses have been straightened and modified
in the past. Some urban rivers have put underground into pipes.
This has resulted in the loss of habitats, species, and amenity. Rivers
have become disconnected from their floodplains. Some of these
losses can be reversed through river restoration, where natural
processes, features, recreational and aesthetic value, and
biodiversity can be re-established. The restoration of rivers and
floodplains is important in improving flood management,
improving water quality and biodiversity, and plays an important
role in helping people to reconnect with nature if access to, and
alongside, water is also improved.
In conurbations or around infrastructure, sustainable drainage
systems (SuDS) should be incorporated into new development or
retrofitted around existing developments. The four pillars of the
sustainable drainage philosophy are water quantity, water quality,
biodiversity, and amenity. The approach is to, wherever feasible,
capture rainfall at source, to minimise the use of pipes and
underground drainage and to maximise the use of Nature-based
Solutions. Source control features include green roofs and rain
gardens. Water can be moved across sites on the surface, by using
swales (vegetated shallow channels) and rills (unvegetated
channels), and it can be slowed and stored, by using ponds and
basins designed to hold water temporarily. By using SuDS, it is also
possible to reduce combined sewer overflows (CSOs) by avoiding
the discharge of surface into the combined sewer network. This
approach improves downstream water quality.
With concerns increasing about over-abstraction of watercourses
and aquifers and the increasing likelihood of drought associated
with climate change, there is growing interest in harvesting
rainwater within urban areas. Harvested rainwater can be used for
irrigation and toilet flushing, reducing the demand on potable
(treated) water supplies, and potentially reducing the volumes of
water entering surface drains, rainwater harvesting usually involves
collecting water from roofs or occasionally from paved surfaces
and storing the water in tanks or cisterns.
Where they are used, rainwater harvesting schemes should be
carefully integrated with plans for green infrastructure, both in
terms of irrigation (where this is required) but also with respect to
water features that might be used to store water.

Page 69 of 138
5.6 Carbon and energy
The restoration and creation of habitat results in the removal of
carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and the sequestration of
carbon in soil and woody vegetation. Wetlands, woodlands, tree
plantings and permanent grasslands all store carbon. Re-wetting
the landscape and creating sponge cities increases this. Habitat
restoration and creation through the provision of green
infrastructure, represent the most effective means of climate
change mitigation, however it should be noted that it can take many
years for habitats to mature, and it is important that sites continue
to be managed appropriately.
Green waste that is produced through the maintenance of green
infrastructure, can be collected, and used to generate biogas, a
renewable natural gas. Plantations can also be irrigated using
wastewater to remove pollutants (bioremediation). Green waste
can be used to make biochar, a form of carbon, which can be buried
in urban landscapes or ploughed into arable fields. Biochar is a soil
improver – it increases water-holding capacity and fertility – but it
also doesn’t decompose, which means that it becomes a long-term
carbon sink. Biochar production from green waste is a promising
way of turning a waste product into a valuable carbon store and
those who collect green waste, can incorporate the production of
biochar into their operations.
One of the most important sources of renewable power in urban
areas is the sun. Photovoltaic panels (PVs) can be readily fitted to
roofs and increasingly will be fitted to other structures, including
for example, shade structures. PVs can be combined with green
roofs (an arrangement known as biosolar roofs), where the benefits
of a green roofs (source control for sustainable drainage,
biodiversity, and cooling of the building) can be combined with the
generation of electricity. Where there is space in suburban and
rural areas, PVs can be fixed to frames at ground level, with
vegetation able to grow around the panels. As PV technology
develops, new configurations and combinations will become
available so that energy generation can be co-located with green
infrastructure.
Carefully sited low-carbon energy schemes such as water or ground
sourced heat pumps in lakes could be installed to power nearby
buildings. There are many examples of micro-solar panels already
being used to power small scale or remote installations such as car
parking ticket machines, lighting, and interpretation. The
generation of power with wind and water needs to consider
impacts on biodiversity and in the case of wind turbines, visual
impacts. However, these methods will continue to evolve and clean
electricity generation is likely to continue to occur within green
infrastructure networks.
Parks, and other green spaces, can provide suitable locations for
ground source and water source heat pumps, which use electricity
to collect low-grade heat from the environment and boost this to
provide hot water and heating for adjacent buildings. The noise
impact of air source heat pumps and other mechanical and
electrical equipment must be assessed before installation. Care
should be taken to ensure that historic and archaeological features
are protected when installing equipment.
Green infrastructure can assist with climate change adaption by
providing shade and evaporative cooling. This can save energy and
carbon by reducing reliance on air conditioning in summer. 
Page 70 of 138
Vegetation, including tree belts, hedges and green walls can also
help to reduce the impact of cold winds in winter.
Pleasant and convenient cycling, horse riding and walking routes,
promotes active lifestyles. Travelling on foot or cycling reduces car
use and results in significant savings of energy and carbon.
Healthier lifestyles also save energy and carbon costs associated
with healthcare.
5.7 Temperature
Green infrastructure modifies microclimates, most notably by
reducing ambient temperatures in summer. The built environment,
which consists of dense and often dark materials like bricks,
masonry, and asphalt, absorbs the sun’s energy during the day and
re-radiates that energy at night as heat. This is the main cause of the
Urban Heat Island Effect (UHIE), where cities can be several degrees
hotter than their rural hinterland, particularly on calm, summer
days. This phenomenon is projected to become worse with climate
change, with excess heat also exacerbating air pollution.
The vegetation, soil, and water of green infrastructure in urban
areas reduces the urban heat island effect. This happens because
leaves reflect sunlight (leaves have a higher albedo7 than most roofs
or pavements). Leaves also provide shade, preventing the sun’s rays
from reaching buildings and streets. Deciduous trees can be useful
7 The more reflective a surface is, the higher the albedo value
in blocking sunlight during the summer, but allowing in winter
sunlight, which can be important for wellbeing.
Evapotranspiration from soils and vegetation and evaporation from
waterbodies provides significant cooling. Green roofs and green
walls protect buildings from the extreme surface temperatures
(which can be more than 50 degrees Centigrade) that occur on
exposed conventional roofs and walls on hot summer days. The
cooling effect of different types of green infrastructure and
planting can be modelled for buildings and neighbourhoods in
detail, which is particularly useful when planning green
infrastructure in urban settings.
When people travel by motor vehicle, waste heat is released, and air
quality deteriorates. By incorporating routes that encourage people
to walk and cycle, green infrastructure also has an indirect effect on
temperature because journeys in motor vehicles are avoided.
Improving the capacity of soils to store water, associated with the
sustainable drainage approach, can reduce summer temperatures.
Trees with larger pits, designed to receive run-off, grow larger, cast
more shade, and provide more evaporative cooling. Green roofs
with deeper substrate hold more water and similarly, provide more
evaporative cooling. Water features and irrigated landscapes in the
urban core also provide evaporative cooling where people live and 
Page 71 of 138
work. If water used for irrigation or water features is from harvested
rainfall, the use of potable water is avoided.
Figure 12: Summer cooling through green infrastructure. Adapted
from Trees and Design Action Group
Green infrastructure elements such as extensive green roofs, green
walls, grasslands, tree groups, heathland and scrub, can be
vulnerable to fire, particularly in periods of drought. The use of
harvested rainfall to irrigate features to reduce temperatures and
help trees and other green infrastructure elements survive drought
and heatwaves should be prioritised. Vegetation on buildings will
be subject to fire risk assessments as set out in the Fire Safety Act
2021. Blue infrastructure, including watercourses and wetlands, will
be important for wildfire resilience. Watercourses and wetlands
can provide natural fire and fuel breaks and these features can be
incorporated into a wider network of wildfire prevention measures
identified in Wildfire Management Plans.
5.8 Food
There is a tradition of people growing some of their own food on
allotments (see section 4.14). Local authorities have been obliged to
provide allotments since the beginning of the twentieth century.
Although the numbers of allotments have been in decline since the
1940s, the cultivation of allotments is still popular.
Most people, however, obtain their food from shops and
restaurants, which means that many people may lack knowledge
and experience of food growing. Although it is not feasible for
everyone to grow their own food in cities, there are considerable
personal and environment benefits associated with local food
growing, which means that more allotments and food growing
facilities should be included in plans and designs for green
infrastructure.
Food growing sites are a component of the green infrastructure
network. They can connect habitats and can include vegetation that
supports pollinators and informal margins for a range of wildlife.
Food growing sites can also:
• Provide access to nature and the open air
• Are educational and therapeutic
Page 72 of 138
• Help to mitigate the urban heat island effect
• Can incorporate sustainable drainage
• Conserve soils and can store carbon in soils
• Provide exposure to microbes that benefits the immune
system
It is important to integrate local food systems as part of a
landscape-led approach to design and master-planning.
Consideration should be given to local food opportunities in the
context of movement, density, commercial activity, and land use to
ensure their viability.
Public spaces and schools should be designed to incorporate local
food-growing opportunities and households should have access to
space to grow food whether in a private garden or in shared
community space.
Allotments, small holdings, and orchards provide space to restore
locally sourced food production. They also offer opportunities to
learn about and gain apprenticeships in gardening, vegetable and
fruit growing, beekeeping and horticulture, as well as providing for
outdoor places and activities that help bring communities together
and encourage an active lifestyle.
Community orchards provide opportunities for volunteers to be
involved in the establishment and maintenance of sites where
apples, other fruits and nuts are grown. There are hundreds of
community orchards where people can meet new people and learn
about fruit growing, keep active and harvest fruit. Community
orchards are now a common feature of large-scale development
proposals. Traditional orchards are a priority habitat, rich in
biodiversity. For new housing development, there is an opportunity
to plant a fruit tree in every garden, as a way of to reconnect
children with nature and with the sources of their food. There are
also more general initiatives, including for example, Incredible
Edible, which promote community cohesion and local businesses
through food growing and the enjoyment and celebration of locally
produced food.

horticulture. This is the process of using plants and gardens to

improve physical health and mental health and wellbeing.
Gardening with others can reduce feelings of isolation or exclusion
and participants can acquire new skills to improve the employment
prospects. Gardening can be part of the rehabilitation process, to
help recovery from illness or injury. This and other nature-based
activities are increasingly being prescribed by doctors through
green social prescribing.
In urban areas, there is now worldwide interest in providing food
growing opportunities, both commercially and for community
groups, on rooftops. On older buildings there are often constraints
associated with the weight of accessible rooftop gardens, however
there are former industrial buildings and multi-storey car parks that
can support such activities. On new buildings the structural
requirements for food growing can be considered. Food growing
gardens have been provided on commercial and residential
buildings as well as hospitals.
5.9 Access to nature and supporting
health benefits
There are physical and mental health and wellbeing benefits
associated with having access to good quality natural green space
near to where people live. People from deprived neighbourhoods
are more likely to suffer from poor health. This can be exacerbated
by a lack of good quality green spaces and places for outdoor
recreation, play, poor air quality, noise, traffic, poor housing, and
higher rates of crime. The abundance of open space in a
neighbourhood, however, should not be mistaken for availability of
accessible green spaces or paths; some of the most deprived areas
are in the countryside.
Evidence shows that Green infrastructure has a positive influence
on population and individual level health and wellbeing, and more
frequent exposure to Green infrastructure has a positive influence
on mortality rates, certain types of morbidity, mental health, quality
of life, and is associated with less stark inequalities in health.
Greener environments are associated with better mental health and
wellbeing outcomes including reduced levels of depression,
anxiety, and fatigue, and enhanced quality of life for both children
and adults. Greenspace can help to bind communities together,
reduce loneliness, and mitigate the negative effects of air pollution,
excessive noise, heat, and flooding. Disadvantaged groups appear
to gain a larger health benefit and have reduced socioeconomicrelated inequalities in health when living in greener communities,
so greenspace and a greener urban environment can also be used
as an important tool in the drive to build a fairer society.
For new green infrastructure, it is recommended that:
• In new developments, there is a mixed provision (e.g., a mix
of different sizes and types of publicly accessible green
spaces, domestic and shared gardens, green routes, street
trees etc.) with appropriate connectivity. Mapping of
existing green infrastructure assets and deficiencies can
assist with planning.
• Improving the quality and management of green
infrastructure and improving knowledge of and accessibility
of spaces, to have a positive impact on perceptions and use.
• Interventions to promote use should involve both changes
to physical spaces as well as complementary social
programmes. 
Page 74 of 138
• Care is needed not to exacerbate inequalities through
processes such as gentrification or restricted access.
• Green infrastructure to promote health and wellbeing is
most likely to be successful if there is a good understanding
of the local social, cultural, and economic context, where the
health (both physical and mental) needs of target
populations are understood, and where linkages are made
with, and buy-in gained from wider networks of social and
health services. Mapping of deprivation can assist with
identification of target groups.
Detailed standards for accessible green space have recently been
revised by Natural England. These Accessible Natural Green Space
Standards (ANGSt), now known as Accessible Green Space
Standards (AGS) are set out in Chapter 2 and Natural England’s
Mapping Database provides an England-wide baseline and analysis
of AGS.
In terms of the design of green and blue infrastructure for access,
the needs of a variety of users with different interests and
capabilities, cultures and backgrounds should be considered.
Inclusive design should ensure that spaces are suitable for underrepresented groups including young people, older people, people
living with disabilities, neurodivergent users, people living in lowincome areas, and people from ethnic minority backgrounds.
Research highlights several cross-cutting barriers that should be
considered:
• a lack of nearby good quality green space.
• personal safety concerns.
• a lack of partnership working with organisations run by or
with under-represented groups.
• limited supportive infrastructure (such as toilets or picnic
spaces) that build confidence in the routine use of nature
space.

of a variety of users with different interests and capabilities,
cultures, and backgrounds. Credit: Natural England
Design to address these issues should tackle common assumptions
and biases; promote co-production and co-participation; support
peer-led initiatives; diversify the recreational offer; design the right
infrastructure including exploring the potential of micro nature
spaces as ‘stepping stones’ to nature engagement; and 
Page 75 of 138
communicate creatively. All these aspects should be considered in
Design and Access (DAS) statements, which accompany and
support planning applications, explaining how a proposed
development responds to its site and setting.
Plate 24: West Gorton Community Park has three distinct design
zones, a woodland, a meadow, and a community plaza. Underlying
all these areas are water management design features, including a
series of swales, raingardens, and bio-retention tree pits. Credit:
Groundwork
For accessible green infrastructure to be successful it must be high
quality and well maintained. The leading method of determining
quality of parks is the Green Flag Award scheme, which considers
how welcoming a place is, how healthy, safe, and secure it is, how
well maintained it is, its impact on the environment (which includes
how it is adapting to climate change), how biodiversity and heritage
is conserved and enhanced and how the community is involved.
When considering the planning and design of residential
communities, or facilities for employment, education and health
care, spatial mapping should be undertaken to understand the
provision of existing accessible green space. Where there are
deficiencies, existing green space should be improved and new
high quality, multi-functional, biodiverse green space should be
created, ideally in areas of greatest need. Safe access connecting
new and existing green space and places where people live, play,
commute and work should be provided and whenever feasible,
those linear connecting features should also enhance and connect
biodiversity.
5.10 Active lifestyles
An active lifestyle integrates physical activity into daily routines.
Also known as ‘Active Living’, this way of life typically involves
walking and cycling to school, to places of work, to shops, or for
leisure. It also encourages participation in active leisure and
recreation, including sport. Advocates of active lifestyles
recommend physical exercise to improve endurance
(strengthening the heart and lungs), improve flexibility, and
maintain strength of muscles and bones, with the aim of reducing
the risk of chronic disease and improving overall health and
wellbeing, including mental health.

Figure 13: Accessible Neighbourhoods for All. Adapted from The
State of Victoria Department of Environment, Land, Water, and
Planning, 2018
Green infrastructure networks include green spaces and
connections for recreation, exercise, organised sports, and active
travel. The network of spaces and connections that promote an
active lifestyle include a range of diverse and widely dispersed
8 https://www.stepneybank.co.uk/
assets throughout the urban and rural landscape, as well as the by
the coast, rivers, and lakes.
The walkable neighbourhood is an organising principle for urban
development and urban life. The intention is to provide residents
access to most, if not all, of their needs within a short walk or cycle
ride from their home to improve life for residents, by improving air
quality and making neighbourhoods safer, quieter, more diverse,
inclusive, and prosperous.
Cycling is particularly important for improving the health of the
individual cyclist, increasing strength and stamina, increasing
cardiovascular fitness, and reducing anxiety and depression.
Cycling is a good option for commuting to the workplace or place
of learning. Travel by cycle does not contribute to noise and air
pollution.
Horse riding is particularly important for women and girls who
make up most of the participants. Horse riding and care promotes
physical activity and mental wellbeing. Horse keeping and riding is
undertaken largely in peri-urban and rural areas, but horses are also
kept in urban areas.
8 The provision of more, safer and better places
to ride supports continuing participation in the sport and is
particularly important to consider around new infrastructure and
new developments in the urban fringe.

England
Wherever feasible, footpaths, bridleways and cycle lanes should be
separated from motor vehicles to improve safety and encourage
more people to take up cycling and walking. National Cycle
Infrastructure Design Guidance (LTN/120) indicates that cyclists
must be physically separated and protected from high volume
motor traffic, both at junctions and on the stretches of road
between them. Where traffic-free paths for cyclists, wheelchair
users, horse riders and pedestrians are not available, streets and
roads may also need to be greened, and speed limits reduced to
promote an active lifestyle and improve access to green space.
Natural features in streets, including, for example, street trees and
rain gardens, are beneficial features in walkable neighbourhoods.
Greening encourages walking trips to destinations such as shops
and schools. Street greening also leads to a reduction in driver
speeds and therefore an improvement in road safety for
pedestrians and cyclists.
To encourage their use, green and blue spaces and pathways must
be aesthetically pleasing, inclusive, spacious, and flexible, to
provide space for all types of activity and sport and to
accommodate future needs. The attractiveness of green spaces will
come, in part, from a strong sense of place. It is also important that
places are tranquil and free of excessive noise.
Sport England also promote Active Design which promotes activity,
health and stronger communities through the way we design and
build our towns and cities.
5.11 Air quality
Air pollution, emitted by motor vehicles, heating systems and
power generation plants, includes nitrogen dioxide, sulphur
dioxide, ozone, carbon monoxide and particulate matter. Longterm exposure to air pollution can cause chronic conditions such
as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases as well as lung cancer,
leading to reduced life expectancy. During short-lived, high
pollution episodes, children, older people, and people with chronic
health problems are especially vulnerable. World Health
Organisation air quality targets are regularly exceeded in cities in
England.
The best way to improve air quality is to reduce the emissions of
pollutants. This will be achieved over the longer term, primarily by
more use of public transport, walking and cycling, the 
Page 78 of 138
electrification of the vehicle fleet and the generation of electricity
and the heating of buildings using combustion-free methods.
Green infrastructure can help to improve air quality through the
creation of attractive spaces close to where people live or work or
through the establishment of verdant cycling or walking routes,
thereby encouraging people to walk or cycle, instead of using
motor vehicles. The cooling and insulation of buildings with green
infrastructure (by for example, green roofs) can also reduce
electricity demands. Given that some electricity continues to be
generated by burning gas or waste, this also indirectly reduces air
pollution.
The vegetation and soil in green infrastructure can also improve air
quality by intercepting pollutants as they spread from roads,
filtering, and trapping particulates and in some cases absorbing
gases. Pollutants are washed into soils where they are broken down
by microbes. Finely branched vegetation, which slows air flows,
and plants with sticky leaves, absorb or trap the most pollutants.
Dense vegetation, including hedges and climbing plants, can act as
a barrier, significantly reducing the amount of polluted air in busy
roads from reaching adjacent homes, schools, colleges, or
workplaces. Modelling has shown that green walls could be used to
reduce air pollution in urban streets lined by rows of tall buildings
(street canyons). Strategically situated planting, especially of trees,
can also help with directing prevailing winds in ways that disperse
air pollution.
It is important to note that trees, usually in combination with
certain building forms, for example, street canyons, can also trap
polluted air. Some species can also emit organic compounds that
can react with vehicle emissions under certain conditions, which
can contribute to air pollution. An understanding of the setting,
prevailing wind patterns, the existing level of pollution and careful
selection of species and planting arrangements is required, when
using planting to reduce air pollution in city centre locations.

5.12 Noise and soundscapes
Excessive noise has a negative effect on both people and wildlife,
affecting quality of life, health, and wellbeing. Long-term exposure
to noise can disturb sleep, affect cardiovascular health,
metabolism, cause psychological problems and can impair
cognitive development in children. Noise pollution has impacts on
birds, which have been shown to modify the pitch and timing of
their singing.
The Environmental Noise (England) Regulations 2006 (as amended)
apply to noise from the wider environment, particularly from
transport, which is the main cause of noise pollution. Noise Action
Plans are based on Strategic Noise Maps, which show noise
problems in large urban areas with major roads and railways. Major
airports publish their own Noise Action Plans.
Tranquillity is a state of being calm and worry-free, which we can
often find in nature. Noise is one of the main causes of loss of
tranquillity. Maps of places in England that are affected by noise
and visual intrusion show a correlation between the road transport
network and places that lack tranquillity. Where otherwise good
quality green infrastructure and access routes to green
infrastructure occurs, noise may result in a reluctance to travel to
and use those spaces. Noise may affect the decision to visit a public
open space, the length of time spent there, the types of activities,
and the overall quality of the experience. There are mental health
benefits associated with positive soundscapes, which are
characterised by the presence of desirable sounds, not just the lack
of noise. It is important to consider the effects of noise and
soundscapes throughout the green infrastructure network.
Figure 15: Mitigating noise using green infrastructure
The main effort in noise abatement is to reduce the production of
noise, through more cycling and walking, switching to public
transport, electrification of the vehicle fleet, and reductions in
speed limits. Noise barriers can be effective, and these can be
formed in part by soil and vegetation. Soil is a high-density material
that forms an excellent sound barrier. Acoustic bunds can be
created by ground modelling, and these can be planted with
vegetation that further decreases noise. Noise buffers composed of
trees and shrubs can reduce noise by up to 10 decibels for every 30
metres width of woodland. Leaves, and branches absorb and
deflect sound energy and are particularly effective at reducing
sharp tones, and this can reduce the noise experienced by people
by up to 50%. Green infrastructure can be part of noise abatement
strategy in the urban environment. Green roofs and green walls can 
Page 81 of 138
reduce the amount of noise entering a building by half, with wetter
substrate performing better than dry, and deeper or thicker buildups intercepting the most noise.
5.13 Education and volunteering
Blue green infrastructure can be a focus for community
participation, providing opportunities for education, training, and
volunteering, and provides a focal point for meeting and bringing
together local communities. This contributes to social cohesion and
improved health and wellbeing. There is evidence that spending
time in nature is associated with a range of benefits including
improved motor skills, better academic performance, and
increased concentration. In supporting the delivery of local health,
social, environmental, and economic priorities, good quality green
space has the potential to deliver substantial benefits for public
health and other local priorities at a relatively low cost.
There is evidence that children are spending less time in nature and
are losing a sense of connection with the natural world. Urban
dwellers, people living in low-income areas, and people from
ethnic minority groups are particularly badly affected. Learning in
the natural environment (LINE) or nature-based learning, has been
shown to provide a range of benefits to students of all ages,
including improved mood, resilience, wellbeing and cognitive,
physical, and social development as well as academic progress in a
range of subjects including maths and languages. From 2025, the
new GCSE in Natural History will further encourage nature-based
learning and to learn about wildlife.
The Natural Connections project found that most children have the
perception of learning better and achieving more when working
outside. 92 per cent of pupils involved in the project said they
enjoyed their lessons more when outdoors, with 90 per cent feeling
happier and healthier as a result.

Garden & Woodland
Green infrastructure can provide attractive and high-quality
locations for formal and informal learning. This can range from
small, specialised facilities like school wildlife gardens, through a
campus-wide approach, whereby biodiverse and functional green
space acts as both a setting and subject for learning. Increasing
green infrastructure is part of national and local government 
Page 82 of 138
approach to climate change adaptation. This will result in an
increase in green infrastructure features like sustainable drainage
systems (including for example, rain gardens), tree plantings and
green roofs. These new arrays of green infrastructure features will
provide good settings for learning in nature.
Learning can also be fostered outside of the school or institute. An
example of this is Forest Schools, where regular opportunities are
provided for young people to develop confidence and self-esteem,
and outdoor skills, as well as learning about the natural
environment, in local woodland. Long established youth
organisations, including the Scouts, continue to use natural space
as a setting for activities that promote connection with the natural
environment. Providing a range of sites within the local green
infrastructure network, where these activities can be safely
accessed and enjoyed by all age groups, including teenagers, is an
important part of efforts to foster learning in the natural
environment.
5.14 Sense of place
‘Sense of place’ is a term used to refer to the way in which people
relate to and perceive the distinctive character, history, and spirit of
an area. Green infrastructure can play an important role in
reinforcing sense of place and local distinctiveness.
To support sense of place, green infrastructure design should be
informed by an understanding of an area’s character and the
opportunities it affords. Landscape Character Assessment provides
a strategic perspective on how areas of differing character relate to
each other and identifies key characteristics, informing ways in
which green infrastructure can create visual and physical links
between areas and contribute to sense of place. Information on
character can be found in National Character Area (NCA) profiles;
county/district and local landscape character assessments;
townscape and historic character studies; and protected landscape
management plans. The NCA profiles include Statements of
Environmental Opportunity that offer suggestions for where action
can best be targeted to conserve and improve the natural
environment. At a more local level, Landscape Character
Assessments (LCAs) often include guidance for managing future
landscape change and can inform landscape and green
infrastructure strategies. Strategies can range from conservation
and enhancement to restoration and creation and often use a mix
of these. Local design guides can provide illustrated examples of
how to take character into account in practice.
There are many ways in which investment in high quality, locally
appropriate green infrastructure can respond to, and reinforce, a
sense of place, whilst helping to restore nature and building
resilience. For example, green infrastructure can help to revitalise
high streets and towns through new tree and shrub planting to
create shade; pocket parks and water features for people to
connect with nature and find tranquillity; and attractive, sheltered
places for activities such as al fresco dining. This can make towns
and city centres more unique and attractive destinations, helping
to increase footfall - whilst delivering benefits for climate and
nature too. In addition, green infrastructure can create attractive
gateways to urban areas, improving visitors’ first impressions, and
make business parks more attractive for investors and workers.
Green infrastructure design also has the potential to improve the
setting of the historic environment through the restoration of
historic assets (including replanting), repurposing areas and 
Page 83 of 138
creating new layers of design. Good traffic-free connections to local
heritage and cultural sites, as well as homes and workplaces, also
improve a sense of place. In contrast, taking a standardised,
uniform approach to designing places with little reference to local
character, materials and associations can weaken distinctiveness.
Green infrastructure should be part of an effort to bring the best of
the new without homogenising or diminishing what is already
present.
Plate 27: The design of the new Mayfield Park, in the heart of
Manchester, has drawn upon its industrial heritage to create a
green oasis with a strong sense of place. The river Medlock has
been opened up, new planting and play facilities introduced, and
materials reused to help tell the story of the area and reinforce the
associations that people have with it. Credit: Natural England
The planning, design, creation, and management of green
infrastructure provides opportunities to facilitate collaboration
and cooperation in local communities and with visitors. In addition,
parks, waterside spaces, and other green infrastructure can provide
focal points for cultural expression and events, helping to connect
communities to their history and creating a vibrant setting for a
wide range of activities and experiences. This creates more
attractive places to live and work and helps to attract new
investment, which builds prosperity.

Function How to improve design
Biodiversity Consider design within the context of strategic needs and local priorities for biodiversity set out in emerging Local Nature
Recovery Strategies (LNRS). Consider providing mosaics of habitats including grassland, shrub, woodland, wetland to
enhance locally important habitats identified in the LNRS. Consider how green infrastructure can contribute to bigger,
better, more and joined up networks of green and blue spaces and natural features for biodiversity. For pollinators consider
a diverse mix of native plants e.g., through flower-rich grassland, green roofs and walls, shrubs, hedges and trees, as well as
structurally diverse vegetation for food, shelter and nest sites including standing dead wood, old trees with cracked bark
and tree cavities. Consider leaving grass to grow longer before mowing and removing arisings.
Soils and
Geodiversity
Consider design within the context of strategic needs and local priorities for soils and geodiversity. Consider underlying
geology and how to avoid losing, eroding (either by wind or water), compacting, sealing over, or contaminating soils.
Consider increasing the area of dense ground cover such as long grass, shrubs and woodland, especially on slopes, and
adding hedges and buffer strips to reduce soil erosion in prone areas such as arable fields.
Water
supply
Consider design in the context of strategic needs and local priorities for water supply. Development often leads to
conversion of permeable land to impermeable surfaces which is likely to impact on water supply. Consider increasing
permeable surfaces such as green spaces, vegetated gardens, and permeable paving, and adding sustainable drainage
options such as rain gardens, retention basins and bioswales, to allow more rainwater to infiltrate into the ground and
recharge groundwater supplies.
Flood
regulation
Flood regulation will be impacted by land use throughout the catchment. Consider design in the context of strategic needs
and local priorities for flood management. Consider increasing the area of woodland in places where it can intercept flow,
permeable surfaces such as green space, vegetated gardens, and permeable paving, and adding sustainable drainage
options such as wetlands, ponds, bioswales, raingardens, green walls and roofs, and retention basins to help slow the flow
of water. Consider potential to de-culvert or re-naturalise rivers and streams.
Water
quality
Consider design within the context of strategic needs and local priorities for water quality. Consider adding or retaining
buffer strips of long grass, shrubs and trees between pollution sources (such as farmland or roads) and water courses.

Function How to improve design
Carbon
storage and
energy
Consider design within the context of strategic needs and local priorities for carbon storage and energy. To enhance these
functions, retain existing peat-based wetlands and woodland. Consider enhancing wetlands and creation of additional
areas of woodland, putting the right trees in the right place to maximise the benefits of tree planting for other ecosystem
services and ensuring there are no perverse outcomes. Design so that green waste that is produced through the
maintenance of green infrastructure, can be collected, and used for renewable energy. Consider clean electricity generation
within green infrastructure networks. Photovoltaic panels (PVs) can be readily combined with green roofs (biosolar) and
increasingly will be fitted to other structures, including for example, shade structures. Carefully sited low-carbon energy
schemes such as water or ground sourced heat pumps in lakes could be installed to power nearby buildings.
Temperature Consider design within the context of strategic needs and local priorities for cooling and shading. Consider planting trees
on the east, south or west side of buildings to provide shade in summer. Green roofs and walls can also help to keep
buildings cool in hot weather and warm in cold weather. These actions can also benefit other services.
Food Consider design within the context of strategic needs and local priorities for food production. Minimising the footprint of
development on productive agricultural land could help reduce decline if continued food production is a priority. Consider
inclusion of allotments or community orchards.
Active
lifestyles
Consider design within the context of strategic needs and local priorities for recreation and active travel, with a focus on
who is benefitting. Engaging with community groups and stakeholders will help inform appropriate measures. Consider
improving public access to suitable areas or creating places that provide recreation opportunities close to where people
live in line with Accessible Greenspace Standards. This could be open access or linear access, with features designed to meet
the needs of users including walkers, cyclists, equestrians, and disabled people.
Access to
nature
Consider design within the context of strategic needs and local priorities for access to nature. Consider improving public
access to larger nature rich areas, close to where people live in line with Accessible Greenspace Standards. Consider
retaining, enhancing, or creating semi-natural habitats, trees and green spaces that will support a mix of native species, as
well as green roofs and walls, street trees, flower-rich grassland and water features which will allow people to connect with
nature and encounter wildlife.

Air quality
regulation
Consider design within the context of strategic needs and local priorities for air quality regulation. Consider adding dense
barriers of woodland or hedgerows between pollution sources, such as busy roads, and places used by people. This can
also benefit noise reduction.
Noise and
soundscapes
Consider design within the context of strategic needs and local priorities for noise reduction. Consider adding dense

learn about and connect with nature through a variety of nature-based activities. These actions can also benefit other
services.
Sense of
place
Consider design within the context of strategic needs and local priorities for local landscape/townscape and historic
character. Engaging with community groups and stakeholders on local needs to find out what habitats, species and natural
features are important locally will help inform appropriate measures. Consider retaining, enhancing, or creating distinctive
semi-natural habitats, trees and green spaces, as well as green roofs and walls, street trees, flower-rich grassland and water
features that reflect local landscape character and which will create or retain a 'sense of place'.

Designing Green Infrastructure in
Different Area Types
6.1 Introduction
Green infrastructure should be multifunctional, connected, varied
and locally appropriate wherever it is located. This chapter
considers how green infrastructure should be planned, designed,
and delivered as a multifunctional network in different
development area types, ranging from the urban core to the
countryside, and into some major infrastructure types such as
hospitals, schools, colleges, and linear infrastructure.
In this chapter we bring together information from preceding
chapters (on Green Infrastructure Standards, green infrastructure
building blocks and designing for multiple functions) to support
the development of local design codes for different area types. This
chapter follows the National Model Design Code approach
whereby area types are identified and supported with guidance.
The intention of this chapter is to identify and characterise some of
the main considerations for planning, designing, and managing
green infrastructure within each area type. It is acknowledged that
the distinction between area types is not always clearly defined,
and that discretion may be required in characterising areas and
applying any advice provided here.
6.2 Biodiversity Net Gain and Green
Infrastructure Standards
Biodiversity Net Gain (BNG) is an approach which aims to leave
biodiversity and the natural environment in a measurably better
state when land use changes and when development occurs. BNG
is already a requirement in many local plans. BNG still relies on the
application of the mitigation hierarchy to avoid, mitigate, or
compensate for biodiversity losses. It is additional to these
approaches, not instead of them.
The Environment Act 2021 includes provisions that will make BNG
mandatory in England for most development types. The
Biodiversity Metric used to calculate biodiversity net gain includes
within it many common green infrastructure habitat features, such
as SUDs, green roofs and walls etc and their inclusion in a scheme
design can contribute towards meeting BNG requirements.
Enhancing the biodiversity value of, or creating new, offsite green
infrastructure, such as parks and other green and blue spaces can
also be used to meet BNG requirements. Natural England’s
Environmental Benefits from Nature tool is designed to work
alongside BNG to enable more detailed consideration of wider
environmental benefits for people and nature.
The Urban Greening Factor (UGF) promotes more nature-rich
environments that increase the functionality, sustainability, and
climate resilience of urban areas. UGFs can also be used alongside
BNG, especially on sites with no or very limited pre-existing
biodiversity value, to drive urban greening by helping to set the 
Page 89 of 138
quantity and functionality of green infrastructure that should be
delivered on-site.
Guidance on applying BNG in development should be followed.
There is existing good practice guidance published by CIEEM, IEMA
and CIRIA for BNG. Guidance for mandatory BNG is currently being
developed by Government and will be available shortly. Full
guidance on the use and application of the Biodiversity Metric is
available.
6.3 Applying the Green Infrastructure
Standards in different area types
Chapter 2 sets out the Green Infrastructure Standards. The
standards may not be applicable in all area types. For example, the
Urban Greening Factor is a planning tool that focuses on the
greening of urban areas, and it is recommended that it is applied
through planning policy to urban or suburban development.
Where appropriate, its use can also be targeted to development
sites and locations where the level of greening is a significant
planning issue or requirement. This may include the
redevelopment of brownfield or post‐industrial sites in rural
locations or the creation of garden communities that would be
expected to provide a significant proportion of green infrastructure
across the entire development. This is also the case with Urban Tree
Canopy Cover Targets, which are most applicable in urban or
suburban areas, and only exceptionally in rural areas - where
appropriate and in keeping with the rural landscape character. In
this chapter we set out how the Green Infrastructure Standards can
be applied in different area types. The Green Infrastructure
Standards are depicted as follows:

Key messages are provided against each of the Green
Infrastructure Standards, for each Area Type.
6.4 High density urban centres (including
high streets)
These areas are characterised by a predominance of sealed
surfaces. The central part of the conurbation is often of historic
interest and there may be buildings, streets or precincts listed for
their heritage value, alongside non-designated historic assets of
importance. Street patterns usually follow ancient alignments, and
many streets are relatively narrow. Buildings are usually multistorey and in the larger cities can be tall, casting heavy shade and 
Page 90 of 138
creating urban canyons. The urban core is often congested, with
buses, commercial vehicles, private cars, buses (and in some cities,
trams), cyclists and pedestrians all competing for space. Air quality
is often poor because of fumes from vehicles. Impervious surfaces
means that the urban core is especially vulnerable to flash flooding
and overheating in summer – problems that are predicted to
become worse with climate change.
Traditionally, offices, shops, banks, restaurants, and other retail
premises have been associated with High Streets, which are the
main, historic streets of commerce in towns. High Streets have been
in decline for decades, having been negatively affected by the
development of shopping centres and retail parks and more
recently, the growth of online shopping and banking. According to
the ONS, employment on High Streets, fell sharply between 2015
and 2018. In addition, the trend away from High Street shopping has
accelerated during the coronavirus pandemic. Addressing the
decline of High Streets will require innovation, investment, and
renewal. These initiatives are often linked to the concept of making
city centres more attractive destinations offering new experiences
and providing desirable places to visit and live in. Plans for renewal
now also take the opportunity to address the climate and
biodiversity emergencies and contribute towards recovery from the
coronavirus pandemic. Such initiatives should include significant
investments in green infrastructure in the urban core, including the
High Street.
New development in urban centres should respond to local
landscape/townscape character and enhance local distinctiveness
through use of local materials and vegetation that help to tell the
story of the area and reinforce the associations that people have
with it. Green infrastructure can support urban regeneration by
encouraging experiences like al-fresco dining or pocket parks,
projects which can increase a community's sense of local
ownership, as well as providing attractive places to sit and relax.
Creating more attractive streets through pedestrianisation and
increasing green infrastructure can help drive more footfall and
encourage people to linger. It can improve air quality and
soundscapes and increase opportunities for active travel.
Where new buildings are proposed, this approach will be
supported by the Urban Greening Factor, Biodiversity Net Gain, and
the drive for source control features (including green and blue
roofs) as part of sustainable drainage approach. Biophilic design
(where this is of interest to the project proponent) will also mean
that buildings feature planting. Any new building can include green
infrastructure and features for wildlife, providing this is considered
at an early stage of the design process
There is an important role for linear features (see 6.13 below) which
can include new and improved routes that bring pedestrians and
cyclists to the city centre from the wide urban area, suburbs and
even the countryside. Access routes and destinations can include
planting, pocket parks and other features that encourage more
visitors.
New or restored urban areas centred on rivers and canals can create
new spaces for recreation, relaxation, and active travel. There may
be opportunities to re-discover urban rivers by de-culverting, for
example. Restored watercourses, ponds and mini wetlands can
create restorative blue spaces in towns and city centres as key
components of urban regeneration.

Much of the green infrastructure in the urban core is associated
with streets (see section 6.6). In some cities there may also be
squares or markets. As vehicular access to these places is reduced,
to create a more pleasant experience for pedestrians and cyclists,
there can be opportunities to add trees, preferably in the ground
with large, modified tree pits to perform as SuDS features. Where
space beneath ground is limited (because for example of
underground services being too congested or when archaeological
features may be present) above-ground planters may be an
alternative. Another dividend associated with reducing vehicular
access to the urban core, is the possibility of creating incidental
green spaces (pocket parks) where parking spaces may no longer be
needed. These may be entirely for the public or can be associated
with cafes, restaurants, other businesses, or shared by businesses
and the public.
There is significant potential for increasing green infrastructure in
the urban core through retrofitting existing buildings and by
including green infrastructure on new buildings. Retro-fitting green
roofs, green terraces and green walls onto existing buildings may
also be possible where the structure and fabric is suitable.
Opportunities to retrofit existing buildings with green
infrastructure will vary according to the type of building, however
many flat-roofed commercial buildings built in the twentieth
century can be retrofitted with green roofs and most walls (unless
they are part of an historic building) can be greened.
Opportunities to retrofit green infrastructure can be identified
through the green infrastructure audit process, which was
pioneered in London by the GLA and Business Improvement
Districts. Other considerations when planning green infrastructure
in the urban core include, excessive summer heat, gusting winds,
poor air quality and localised surface water flooding. Mapping and
computer modelling of these factors can be helpful in predicting
the effectiveness of proposals.
Biophilic Design
Biophilic design is an approach which is growing in popularity in
the design and construction industry. It seeks to improve health
and wellbeing and the wider environment by connecting the
occupants of buildings with nature. Biophilic design is supported
by certification schemes, which track the process of incorporating
nature within and outside of buildings. Biophilic design promotes
direct experience of nature (for example natural light, water, and
plants) and indirect experience of nature (for example images of
nature or natural materials) and is therefore compatible with the
green infrastructure approach set out in this guidance.
Safety & Security
Significantly increasing the amount of planting in urban areas can
raise concerns regarding visibility, safety, and crime, however these
issues can be addressed by implementing good design principles.
These include maintaining visibility and sightlines to facilitate
surveillance, avoiding the creation of isolated spaces, and ensuring
good maintenance, including the prompt repair of damage caused
by vandalism. The Design Council provides advice on strategies and
techniques for crime prevention. Advice for designers is available
from the Secured by Design and related schemes, on how to
improve the security of buildings as well as their immediate
surroundings.

Application of the GI Standards - high density urban
centres (including high streets)

• Small (at least 0.5ha) but frequent greenspaces and pocket
parks most likely to fit into the context of high density urban
centres, though there may be opportunities for more
generous larger greenspaces.
• Design accessible greenspace as part of visitor experience
and for wellbeing of workers and residents.
• Buildings may need to be taller in dense urban centres, so
that there is room for greenspace that meets local capacity
standards (e.g., hectares of accessible greenspace per 1,000
population).
• There is no net loss of accessible green space per head of
population at an area-wide level.
• Look for opportunities to convert unused land to natural
greenspace.
• Provide attractive green routes for active travel to and from
greenspaces.
• Design green space to meet Green Flag Award criteria and
best practice in accessibility for all.
• Ensure that greenspaces feel safe, welcoming, and well
maintained to encourage inclusive use and attract visitors.
• Utilise natural features to create high quality settings to
historic buildings and to enhance public realm.
• Engage local communities/retailers/friends of groups in
design and management of green infrastructure e.g.,
watering street trees as they establish.
• Consider whether development in urban centres could
contribute to nature recovery and the creation and
restoration of wildlife rich habitats to deliver local nature
recovery objectives, for example through incorporating
features for species, biodiverse green roofs, species-rich
grassland, rain gardens, hedgerows and trees.
• Whilst less likely in this context, in some instances there may
be opportunities to contribute to the creation or
enhancement of Local Nature Reserve or Local Wildlife Sites.

• Design to meet locally set urban tree canopy cover uplift
targets.
• Plant trees to create shaded high streets that benefit from the
soil volume of connected tree pits and provide sensory
interaction with nature, as well as sequestering carbon.

developments and new streets are tree-lined, ideally in large
tree pits to enhance resilience.

6.5 Urban
Conurbations outside of the historic urban core, referred to here as
urban areas, usually have a more modern road system than the
historic urban core. Impervious surfaces still dominate; however, it
is likely that there will be more opportunities to remove asphalt and
paving to make space for street trees, rain gardens and pocket
parks. Twentieth century transport planning tended to prioritise the
provision of extra space for private motor vehicles, and as cities
review this, more space can be made available for people and
planting. The removal of lanes and parking spaces for motor
vehicles provides opportunities for avenues of trees, rain gardens,
linear parks, pocket parks and routes for active travel.
Housing in urban areas, particularly twentieth century social
housing and flats, is often high density, with little or no gardens and
shared green space, parks or verges that are often predominantly
amenity grassland, requiring frequent mowing, and have limited
value for biodiversity. There is potential to modify these places by
amending mowing regimes, planting hedges, planting orchards,
creating vegetable plots, planting trees, and retrofitting sustainable
drainage systems, including for example, rain gardens, as well as
play features and spaces for teenagers. Changes to planting and
maintenance regimes should always be developed in partnership
with residents, who may also be able to increase their use these
spaces and their participation in decision-making and
maintenance.
New development in urban areas should respond to local
landscape/townscape character and enhance local distinctiveness
through use of local materials and vegetation that help to tell the
story of the area and reinforce the associations that people have
with it. New development will be supported by the Urban Greening
Factor, Biodiversity Net Gain, and the drive for source control
features (including green and blue roofs) as part of sustainable
drainage approach. New or restored urban areas centred on rivers
and canals can create new spaces for recreation, relaxation, and
active travel. There may be opportunities to re-discover urban rivers
by de-culverting, for example. Restored watercourses, ponds and
mini wetlands can create restorative blue spaces in urban areas as
key components of regeneration.
There will be opportunities to green buildings in the urban area, in
common with buildings in the urban core. The urban core tends to
be dominated by commercial and institutional buildings, with more
residential and retail land uses dominating in the wider urban area,
which may have an influence over the type, use and maintenance
of green infrastructure provided. Retrofitting existing residential
buildings with green infrastructure can be challenging, however
where new residential buildings are planned, every opportunity
should be taken to include green roofs, terraces, and green walls.
Many of these can be accessible (roof gardens and planted terraces
and balconies), providing residents with opportunities to enjoy
nature at home. In residential areas, there will be more
opportunities to involve people with planting initiatives and the
maintenance of green infrastructure, including the watering of
trees during drought, food growing and tending gardens in the
public realm. For example, the Arboricultural Association has a
programme that encourages volunteers to water street trees. Urban
greening can be underpinned by green infrastructure strategies and
audits, climate change adaptation and flood resilience initiatives, 
Page 97 of 138
health and wellbeing and educational programmes, with
partnerships that encourage volunteer involvement.
Application of the GI Standards - Urban

parks most likely to fit in urban context, though there may
be opportunities for more ambitious larger greenspaces.

change
Page 99 of 138
6.6 Streets
Streets often have a role in providing connections in the green
infrastructure network. Some cities already have many street trees,
whilst others have few. Where there are already mature or veteran
trees, efforts should be intensified to find ways of retaining them.
Trees may be historic features and notable within the streetscape.
Where there are relatively few trees, efforts to plant more should be
prioritised. There may be opportunities to reinstate historic
planting where it can enhance landscape character. Some cities (for
example, Manchester) have Tree Action Plans that provide strong
protection for trees and require replacement of any trees that are
lost. Many streets in the urban core are too narrow or may have
such underground congestion caused by utilities, so that
significant new in-the-ground planting is not feasible. Where there
are street trees, there will be the issue of suitable replacement
species as trees fail or need to be felled for safety reasons. Expert
advice is needed when tree works are required, and local authority
tree officers can advise. Tree works generate many concerns and
local people need to be briefed and involved in decisions. When
tree works or planting is required it should be undertaken promptly
and to a high standard.
There is also increasing interest in maximising the role of street
trees in the sustainable drainage systems and as part of the wider
ecological network. Increasingly, where there is space, cities are
looking to install rain gardens and other similar features in streets.
These are planted beds that are designed to receive surface-water
runoff, thereby taking pressure off the existing conventional
surface water drainage system. Water can be cleaned and stored in
rain gardens, which when full, can overflow into other rain gardens
or the existing drains or watercourses. An example of this approach
is Sheffield’s Grey to Green scheme.
The Healthy Streets approach, developed by Transport for London,
includes indicators, which relate to pedestrians from all walks of
life and active travel, public transport, clean air, safety, noise
abatement, road crossings, places to stop and rest, feeling calm and
safe, shade and shelter and things to see and do. Green
infrastructure contributes towards these objectives in a costeffective way. Examples of green infrastructure features in streets
that support this approach include:
• Build outs (for example rain gardens) that make it easier for
pedestrians to cross lanes of traffic.
• Shade trees that keep people cool and relaxed.
• Green walls and other planting in street canyons that
improve air quality, reduce noise pollution, and improve
perceived soundscape quality.
Application of the GI Standards - Streets
• Small but frequent greenspaces and pocket parks
incorporated into streets.
• Use GI interventions to enhance access routes to natural
greenspaces, so that routes themselves are attractive and
multi-use. 
Page 100 of 138
• Look for opportunities to involve communities in street
planting, growing food and maintaining GI. e.g., watering
street trees as they establish.
• Consider how urban streets can contribute to nature
recovery for example though incorporating features for
species, biodiverse green roofs or rain gardens, or front
gardens designed for wildlife with hedges or native species
can add to the street scene, and how streets can help to
connect wildlife areas.
• Consider how urban streets can contribute to meeting UGF
of 0.3 for predominately commercial and 0.4 for
predominately residential, when urban streets are within the
development boundary.
• There is no net loss of green cover in urban neighbourhoods.
• A variety of GI interventions can be incorporated into the
street scene including rain gardens, street trees, meadow
verges. Ensure adequate specification and space for growth
of trees and planting schemes.
• Front gardens designed for wildlife with hedges or native
species can add to the street scene.
• Use GI to create attractive places to sit and relax as part of
enhanced street scene.
• Design to meet locally set urban tree canopy uplift targets.
• New and existing trees are incorporated into new
developments and new streets are tree lined, ideally in large
tree pits to enhance resilience.
• Use trees to create shaded active travel routes, to give streets
local identity and to sequester carbon.

6.7 Suburbs/urban fringe
Suburbs on the edges of towns and cities became commonplace
during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries when the
development of rail and road transport made commuting to the
workplace viable. Many were carefully laid out with tree-lined
roads, front and back gardens, local amenities and bus routes that
provided connections with town centres and places of work.
Suburbs have continued to expand; however, landscape character
has declined. Housing density is relatively low in suburbia. The
interface between the suburbs and the wider countryside can be
critical in wildfire-prone landscapes.
Residents of suburbs tend to rely on the car for transport and roads
take up a relatively high proportion of space. The reliance on
private transport means that social and commercial amenities can
be some distance from where people live. Suburbs are usually
within reach of town centres and the countryside, however there
are often barriers to the movement of pedestrians and cyclists,
caused by major highways and railways or other land uses. Some
suburbs are very extensive. Large suburbs can be difficult to
navigate, with confusing road patterns, and a lack of through
routes. The creation of walkable neighbourhoods, with amenities
and public transport will help to alleviate these problems.
Where gardens occur, there is a tendency for these to be lost to car
parking, paving, decking and artificial grass. The loss of gardens, the
sealing of soils and the removal of planting contributes to declines
in biodiversity and can increase the risk of surface water flooding
and high temperatures in summer. The government provides
guidance on how to use permeable surfaces in front gardens. The
RHS has also issued advice on the greening of front gardens,
driveways, and parking areas.
New development in sub-urban areas should respond to local
landscape/townscape character and enhance local distinctiveness
through use of local materials and vegetation that help to tell the
story of the area and reinforce the associations that people have
with it. New development will be supported by the Urban Greening
Factor, Biodiversity Net Gain, and the drive for source control
features (including green and blue roofs) as part of sustainable
drainage approach. New or enhanced suburban areas centred on
rivers and canals can create new spaces for recreation, relaxation,
and active travel. Restored watercourses, ponds and mini wetlands
can create restorative blue spaces in suburban areas. There may be
opportunities to re-naturalise watercourses for example.
Roads in suburbs often have a greater capacity to accommodate
more tree planting with larger pits, verges, sustainable drainage
features like rain gardens, traffic-free routes for cyclists and subtle
fire breaks. Often, new green infrastructure can be combined with
traffic calming and other improvements to the public realm.
Facilities and routes can be established to create more walkable
neighbourhoods. Residents can be involved in environmentally
friendly gardening, encouraging wildlife through gardening, the
provision of bird nesting and bat roosting boxes, making routes for
hedgehogs, rainwater harvesting and other activities that improve
the green infrastructure network. Where dwellings are extended or
redeveloped, there will be opportunities (encouraged through the
planning approval process) to plant new hedges, make
replacement plantings of trees, to install rain gardens and smallscale green roofs.

their discretion.

6.8 Rural
Rural areas are dominated by agriculture. Although most of the
space in the rural landscape is green infrastructure in the widest
sense, and although some farmland is managed in a way that
supports nature, reduces flooding, and increases access for people,
intensive agriculture has dramatically negatively affected wildlife
and reduced the range and amount of ecosystem services provided.
Fragments of important habitats, which can be ancient, and of and
cultural importance, do occur, and most of these will be designated
by statute (e.g., SSSIs) or, if not of the highest value, through the
County-wide non-statutory nature conservation system. Most
semi-natural areas are however isolated to some extent by intensive
agriculture and roads. There are positive aspects of roads in
otherwise degraded landscapes - the verges and hedges often
provide refuges for the flora and fauna that was once more
widespread across farms and verges and hedges also act as
important ecological corridors. Authorities responsible for highway
maintenance are also making efforts to increase the biodiversity of
road verges, with advice on best practice available from Plantlife.
Woodland cover in England is relatively low (10%) and 90% of
wetlands have been lost in England over the last century. The loss
of wetland has contributed to the decline in biodiversity, however
the combination of low woodland cover and draining of wetlands
means that accelerated surface water runoff in catchments
(especially the upper catchments of river basins) contributes to
downstream flooding, where human populations are higher and
where settlements, businesses and infrastructure are often close to
rivers or in some cases, on floodplains. Another problem in the rural
landscape is unsustainable soil erosion and degradation, which is
often associated with poor farming practices and surface water
runoff.
A green infrastructure approach in rural areas can help to address
problems with habitat loss, soil erosion and flooding in lower
catchments, by encouraging strategic interventions that buffer and
connect existing sites of value. The interception and slowing of
surface water run-off (particularly on higher ground and slopes),
through, for example, the tree planting or habitat restoration,
should be prioritised. Cross-slope plantings can be very effective in
slowing runoff and reducing soil erosion where available land is
limited. The identification of opportunities to re-naturalise
watercourses or re-wet areas that were once wetlands is also
recommended. The restoration of wetlands and increases in
woodland cover will also sequester carbon in timber and soils.
People in rural areas without access to private vehicles can find it
difficult to reach essential services. Improvements to public
transport, footpaths, bridleways, and cycle routes can help to
alleviate these problems. Safe traffic-free routes for walking and
cycling can also increase visitor numbers and boost tourism.
Development on greenfield sites should retain existing habitats,
geological, archaeological and heritage features. Development
should follow Biodiversity Net Gain requirements as set out in
legislation. Though not principally used in urban areas, local
authorities may wish to add Urban Greening Factor scores where
appropriate in greenfield development, to set the quantum of onsite greening. Source control features (including green and blue
roofs) may help to deliver a sustainable drainage approach.
Vegetated boundaries and other natural linear features should
connect with the wider green infrastructure network. Connections 
Page 107 of 138
for walking and cycling and access to public transport should be
provided. Within greenfield sites, plans should be developed with
multi-functional and biodiverse green infrastructure and
sustainable drainage in mind, before attention is paid to roads and
buildings.
Application of the GI Standards - Rural
• Protect and enhance existing green infrastructure.
• Design new accessible green or blue space to meet a mix of
size/proximity access standards including small, medium,
and large greenspaces (2ha, 10ha, 20ha, 100ha, 500ha) and
to meet capacity standards (minimum of 2ha/000
population).
• There is no net loss of accessible green space per head of
population at an area-wide level.
• Seek opportunities to create district or sub-regional
greenspaces, ensuring that features, activities, and facilities
are appropriate in scale.
• Provide attractive green routes for active travel to and from
greenspaces and to connect rural areas with urban centres.
• Where appropriate, design accessible green space to meet
Green Flag Award criteria, without urbanising. Consider
application of best practice in accessibility for all.
• Ensure that more formal greenspaces feel safe, welcoming.
There may be more opportunities for wilder semi-natural
areas in larger greenspaces.
• Enhance the natural quality of historical sites as appropriate
to their setting.
• Engage local communities in design of green infrastructure.
• Manage for nature including wildlife gardening.
• There may be opportunities to consider how development in
rural areas can contribute nature recovery and the creation
and restoration of wildlife rich habitats to deliver local
nature recovery objectives, for example though
incorporating features for species, biodiverse green roofs or
rain gardens, and creating or enhancing larger areas speciesrich meadows, hedgerows, new woodland, or wetland to
enhance nature.
• Explore opportunities to create or enhance an area that
could contribute to the 1 hectare of Local Nature Reserve per
1,000 population standard or enhance/create a Local
Wildlife Site, or to buffer and enhance existing designated
sites and form part of the Nature Recovery Network. 
Page 108 of 138
• Whilst UGF is principally used in urban areas, Local
authorities can choose to add target scores where
appropriate and at their discretion e.g., for residential
development on greenfield sites in rural areas such as new
garden communities, garden suburbs and garden villages.
• Retain and enhance existing green infrastructure. • Protect, buffer, and connect key sites. Create and restore
semi
-natural habitats such as woodland, peatland and
grasslands to reduce flood risk, improve water quality and
reverse soil erosion.
• Proactively integrate GI from the outset. • This standard has been designed for urban areas. It may be
appropriate to consider tree canopy cover uplift in rural
areas, but it would be particularly important to ensure that
tree planting is appropriate to the local landscape character
.
• Allow existing woodlands and groves to expand and build on
the characteristics of the area such as hedgerows with trees,
tree
-lined watercourses, field trees and orchards.
• New and existing trees are incorporated into new
developments and new streets are tree lined ensuring that
this reflects and enhances local landscape character.

6.9 Parks and green space
Public parks, gardens, and other green spaces such as burial
grounds and commons are often the key components of urban
green infrastructure networks. Public parks are maintained for the
public and are free to access year-round. There are also privately
owned parks. Some are free to visit, and others may charge a fee.
Parks are often designed for amenity purposes and support a range
of informal recreation or more formal sport and recreational uses.
They are places where people meet, socialise, relax, exercise, play
sport and connect with nature, daily. Many are of historic or
cultural importance and contribute towards sense of place.
Evidence shows that they play an important role in supporting
physical and mental health and wellbeing.
Parks and green space have proved to be long-lasting and
adaptable, however there is often scope for improvements that
take account the needs of different age, cultural and social groups
Parks and green space should have equality of access including
disabled access and should adhere to the standards set in the UK
Equality Act 2010 (as amended) as a minimum. They should be
designed for equality of access from the outset through
engagement with representative local groups.
Country parks were first created in the 1970s. They are designed to
give people experience of the countryside and were established on
former country house estates, industrial sites, mineral workings,
farms, or around historic monuments. Most are accredited by
Natural England. They are public green spaces, often at the edge of
urban areas, which provide places for people to enjoy the outdoors
and experience nature in an informal, rural setting.
Plate 28: Design greenspace through engagement with
representative local groups. Credit: Natural England
In a neighbourhood it is good to have a variety of different sizes and
types of parks and green space, for example pocket parks, doorstep
green spaces and natural green space, connected physically or
functionally with other green infrastructure as part of a network.
Natural England’s Publicly Accessible Green Space Standards (see
Chapter 2) set out size and distance criteria for accessible green
space.
Parks and urban green spaces are often comprised of amenity
grassland, with collections of exotic and native specimen trees,
sports pitches, flower borders and shrubberies. Evidence shows
that the visits and value of green space, to both people and wildlife, 
Page 111 of 138
are greater where there is a more diverse landscape, including for
example meadows and woodland. Opportunities to provide more
variety and structure should be sought.
Amenity grassland is important many in parks for recreation and
sports, however in many cases some of this can be replaced with
meadows to enhance biodiversity. It may be necessary to plant
wildflowers or to remove turf and re-seed since much amenity
grassland is dominated by grasses that out-compete wildflowers.
Meadows require less intensive mowing regimes to conventional
lawns, and grass cuttings should be removed to reduce fertility,
which increases diversity.
There are schemes that use the biomass in grass clippings and other
green waste to produce energy or to make biochar (a soil improver
that sequesters carbon). Parks should be designed with this in mind
with either composting facilities or collection points for clippings
and green waste.
There may be opportunities to extend tree planting in parks and
green spaces. Tree planting can include more native species and a
wider range of species (including non-native species), to increase
biodiversity and decrease the risk of losses associated with stresses
brought about by climate change. It is vital that successor planting
is planned for existing mature trees. The choice of trees and
planting locations should be in keeping with historic designs, local
landscape character and consideration of pests and diseases. Parks
and green spaces should be designed to include features for
wildlife, including native flora to increase the diversity of
invertebrates, refuges for invertebrates, bird boxes, bat boxes and
hedgehog highways.
Public parks often include lakes, ponds, and water features. These
are popular with the public. Demand for water features is likely to
increase in concert with warmer summers. Consideration should be
given to incorporation of more water bodies, wetlands, and other
blue infrastructure features in parks – see Chapter 4. Water bodies
should be designed with marginal emergent aquatic vegetation,
which provides habitat and improves water quality. Consideration
should be given to facilitating public access in and on water bodies
(for boating and swimming), providing safety and water quality
requirements are met, and wildlife is not impacted.
Urban runoff can be intercepted with rain gardens and constructed
wetlands to improve water quality before it enters water bodies. In
some parks and gardens, there may be space to provide sustainable
drainage features that protect the wider urban environment from
flooding. This might include detention basins that only come into
use infrequently so that intensive recreational uses can continue
unhindered.
In districts where local access to allotments may be limited, or
where there are long waiting lists, consideration might be given to
providing space for growing food or creating community orchards
in parks and green spaces.
Play is critical for child development. Facilities should be available
for structured and unstructured play and recreation, offering
adventure, exercise, and fun. This can include places for natural
play (for example play areas that use fallen trees and boulders) and
places for teenagers, including teenage girls. Provision of tranquil
places in natural settings with positive soundscapes will attract
people who like to spend time in quiet contemplation.
Page 112 of 138
By situating green spaces close to dwellings, workplaces, and
recreational facilities, we can promote natural surveillance of
places that are open, regularly used and overlooked. Carefully
considered pathways and lighting will also increase safety. Design
of new green space should consider access points and signage so
that it is easy to find ways into and out of the park. Consideration
should be given to whether perimeter features are needed or
whether the park seamlessly integrates into its surroundings. If
perimeter features are needed, native hedgerows are a way of
combing a screening effect with habitat creation.
For accessible green infrastructure to be successful it must be high
quality and well maintained. The leading method of determining
quality is the Green Flag Award scheme, which considers how
welcoming a place is, how healthy, safe and secure it is, how well
maintained it is, its impact on the environment (including how it is
adapting to climate change), how biodiversity and heritage is
conserved and enhanced and how the community is involved.
Natural England’s quality indicators can be used alongside the
Green Flag scheme and applied to networks of green infrastructure.
Whilst this guide focuses on green infrastructure, there will be a
need to consider the design of built facilities that support access
and enjoyment of the sites, such railings, walls, stores, kiosks, cafés,
car and cycle parking, signage and toilets depending on the size
and purpose of the park. These can be designed to incorporate
green features such as green roofs, green walls, and features for
species such as bird and bat boxes and invertebrate refuges (see
Chapter 4).
Parks can be centres for nature-based activities and clubs, such as
community gardening and food growing, practical conservation
such as tree planting, nature walks, cycling, green exercise, or can
be the places where communal events or celebrations are held.
Working with communities to understand what kind of activities
they would like their green space to support, can aid design. These
activities could support green social prescribing which focuses on
providing patients with accessible and local places where they can
spend time in nature.
As part of Biodiversity Net Gain implementation, parks and
greenspaces could provide biodiversity units that are made
available in the BNG market, as long as this provision complies with
the regulations e.g., is legally secured, registered and meets the
additionality rules. Given that BNG requires management for a 30-
year period, it could provide a mechanism for long term funding of
biodiversity enhancements in existing parks and greenspace.
Consideration should be given to how BNG can be delivered
alongside other benefits such as access, recreation, and other
ecosystem services.
Application of the GI Standards – Parks and green space
• Consider how parks or green space can be designed to meet
accessible greenspace standards, particularly in areas of
high deprivation or where there is a lack of private garden
space.
• Consider how it can best meet local capacity standards (e.g.,
hectares of accessible greenspace per 1,000 population)
Page 113 of 138
• There is no net loss of accessible green space per head of
population at an area-wide level.
• Provide attractive green routes for active travel, connecting
green spaces to residential areas and other facilities.
• Design green space to meet Green Flag Award criteria and
best practice in accessibility for all.
• Ensure that greenspaces feel safe, welcoming and have a
sense of arrival. Ensure they are designed to encourage
inclusive use, including for older people, people living with
disabilities, under-represented groups, low-income families,
and people from ethnic minority backgrounds.
• Ensure urban green spaces offer a wide range of activities
and utilise each as an opportunity to incorporate
experiences of nature.
• Consider opportunities for nature-based activities as part of
Green Social prescribing initiatives.
• Consider how sites can contribute to nature recovery and
the creation and restoration of wildlife rich habitats to
deliver local nature recovery objectives, for example though
incorporating features for species, biodiverse green roofs or
rain gardens, species-rich grassland, hedgerows, trees and
woodland or wetland to enhance nature.
• Explore opportunities to enhance or create Local Nature
Reserves or Local Wildlife Sites within parks and greenspace.
• Consider how parks and green space can contribute to wider
urban greening.
• There is no net loss of green cover in urban neighbourhoods.
• Connect to the wider GI network to create park systems and
provide diverse habitats and features for wildlife.
• Design features that attenuate urban runoff.
• Consider opportunities for using the green estate to
generate renewable energy.
• Design to meet locally set urban tree canopy cover uplift
targets.
• Consider opportunities for planting large tree species in
open ground and utilise ability of trees to give character to
open space and to contribute to net zero targets.
• Consider the resilience of tree species to long term climate
change.

6.10 Commercial, business, and industrial
sites
Commercial, business, and industrial sites tend to be on the edge of
conurbations and are dominated by roads and vehicle parking
spaces. They may also be closely associated with transportation
infrastructure, for example motorway junctions, railway yards or
ports. In common with other urban development types, sealed
surfaces dominate. Industrial buildings can be large and are
invariably surrounded by hardstanding. However, grass verges,
ornamental planting and tree planting are commonly encountered.
Traditionally, planting around commercial and industrial sites is
usually designed for visual screening. Sealed surfaces can lead to
surface water flooding (or even where the drainage system can
cope locally, these developments may contribute to downstream
flooding). Ecological value is usually limited, with planting being
primarily ornamental.
The retrofitting of green infrastructure in these places is almost
always possible. Rainwater from downpipes can be intercepted and
rain gardens can be incorporated into verges. The maintenance of
existing landscape can be adjusted to encourage more species-rich
grassland instead of amenity grassland. This will involve reduced
mowing regimes, with delays to allow flowering and the removal of
arising to reduce fertility (which increases diversity). Topsoil should
not be used when establishing species-rich swards – subsoils or
low-nutrient substrates are preferred.
Sealed surfaces can be removed and replaced with swales, rain
gardens and trees. Initiatives to encourage travel to work on foot,
by cycle or public transport have the potential to free car parking
space, where asphalt can be removed to expose soil and establish
vegetation. The roofs on industrial and commercial buildings tend
to be lightweight and therefore retrofitting with green roofs is
usually not feasible, however screening walls with vegetation,
using intensive green wall systems or climbing plants may be an
option.
When planning and designing commercial, business, and industrial
sites, development should follow Biodiversity Net Gain
requirements as set out in legislation. An Urban Greening Factor of
0.3 for predominantly commercial development is recommended.
Consideration should be given to providing links to adjacent
ecological networks to maintain and strengthen wider connectivity.
Sustainable drainage should feature Nature-based Solutions and
should not rely on tanks or detention basins alone. With new
buildings, there is the opportunity to include green roofs in the
design, which makes a significant contribution to the sustainable
drainage system, helps to cool the building in summer and can
provide valuable habitat, notably for ground-nesting birds. Vehicle
parks should include trees, swales, and rain gardens. Consideration
should be given to more use of free-draining vegetated surfaces
that are designed to take vehicular traffic, including for example,
Austrian gravel lawns. Plans for active travel to work mean that
storage should be provided for cycles (and these can have green
roofs and features for wildlife). Cycle routes and footpaths should
provide people with the opportunity to cycle or walk to work. As is
the case in other areas, green infrastructure can improve the
physical and mental health and wellbeing of people.
Page 116 of 138
Application of the GI Standards – Commercial, business,
and industrial sites
• Small (0.5ha – 2ha) but frequent greenspaces and pocket
parks most likely to fit in commercial, business and
industrial sites, though there may be opportunities for more
ambitious larger greenspaces.
• Local capacity standards (e.g., hectares of accessible
greenspace per 1,000 population) tend to apply to
residential developments, but where greenspace in
commercial, industrial, and business sites serves both
workers and local residents they may be appropriate.
• There is no net loss of accessible green space per head of
population at an area-wide level.
• Look for opportunities to convert unused land to natural
greenspace.
• Provide attractive green active travel commuting routes,
connecting workplaces and local residential areas.
• There may be opportunities to design green space in this
context to meet Green Flag Award criteria and best practice
in accessibility for all.
• Ensure that greenspaces feel safe, welcoming, and well
maintained to encourage inclusive use and attract visitors.
• Utilise natural features to create high quality settings to
historic buildings and to enhance public realm.
• Engage local businesses and communities in design and
management of green infrastructure.
• Consider how sites can contribute to nature recovery and
the creation and restoration of wildlife rich habitats to
deliver local nature recovery objectives, for example though
incorporating features for species, biodiverse green roofs or
rain gardens, species-rich grassland, hedgerows, trees and
woodland or wetland to enhance nature.
• Explore opportunities to enhance or create Local Nature
Reserves or Local Wildlife Sites within commercial
development.
• UGF of 0.3 for predominately commercial development.
• There is no net loss of green cover in urban neighbourhoods.
• Create a variety of green infrastructure including rain
gardens, biodiverse or bio-solar green roofs, green walls.
Enhance amenity grassland with seasonal meadows and
diversified planting. 
Page 117 of 138
• Minimise sealed surfaces and prioritise permeable paving to
improve water infiltration and create space for sustainable
drainage.
• Use GI to create attractive places to eat and relax for workers
as part of enhanced public realm.
• Proactively integrate GI rather than leaving it to the margins
or left-over spaces.
• Design to meet locally set urban tree canopy cover uplift
targets.
• Utilise species mix, variations in density and form, to create
tree planting that integrate developments into the
surrounding landscape, provides shade for buildings and for
people, and sequesters carbon.
• Consider the resilience of tree species to long term climate
change.

6.11 Schools and colleges
Schools and colleges typically include several buildings; however,
grounds make up 80% of the English Schools estate. This provides
opportunities to create nature-rich, park-like spaces as the settings
for buildings. This aligns with the Department for Education’s
National Education Nature Park initiative. This approach will
enhance air quality, improve surface water management, reduce
excess summer heat, and allow children and young people to have
experience of nature that will enhance, and provide context for,
their learning. The Children and Nature Programme demonstrated
that interventions within school grounds have most success when
the whole school (including the leadership team, teachers and
maintenance staff) is involved.
Planting should be used to make the sense of arrival at a school
comparable to that of a park or neighbourhood green space. Paths
should take people through nature-inclusive outdoor spaces.
Where space is limited, it may be appropriate to use planters
(including SuDS planters) and pre-planted fences (pre-grown ivy,
and other climbing plants trained onto wire fence panels). The latter
are used to help reduce exposure to air pollution from traffic in
urban areas. Retrofit of recycling or cycle stores with Nature-based
Solutions should also be considered. This kind of intervention can
provide screening and bring nature close to classrooms, providing
inspiration and educational opportunities. There may also be
opportunities for green infrastructure to be the setting for natural
play. For more advice on outdoor learning and play see Learning
Through Landscapes.
The planning of facilities in school grounds should take account of
summer heat. For example, artificially surfaced games areas,
including MUGAs, should not be installed close to the south side of
buildings. Trees, hedges and climbing plants help to reduce
temperatures. Strategically planted trees and/or the retention of
existing trees can help to reduce glare and provide summer shade.
When considering the design of new buildings, the connection to
nature from within the building should be designed as part of
strategic site planning. Views of seasonal events in nature (e.g.,
falling leaves, swaying branches, birds in flight) can benefit pupils,
students and staff and improve mental health and wellbeing.
The design of new buildings should follow Biodiversity Net Gain
requirements as set out in legislation. DfE’s advice on Urban
Greening Factors for education sites should be followed. Green
infrastructure integrated into new schools and colleges could
include green roofs or biosolar roofs (biosolar roofs are green roofs
combined with photovoltaic panels). Green roofs are important for
summer cooling, as interiors are vulnerable to overheating during
peak summer temperatures. Green roofs also act as a source control
method in the sustainable drainage systems and can also
contribute towards a development’s BNG requirements.
To reduce the risk of flash flooding, caused by heavy downpours,
schools and colleges may include a range of sustainable drainage
measures, e.g., rainwater harvesting systems, planters that store
water, rain gardens, trees with large pits that store water, swales,
wetlands, and ponds. Consideration should be given to the
remodelling of landscaped areas and lawns so that they act as
temporary rainwater detention basins following storms. Extensive
boundary planting, particularly around playing fields, can include 
Page 120 of 138
hedges, swales, and belts of native trees, helping to strengthen
wider green infrastructure and ecological networks.
The Department for Education recognises the role of green
infrastructure in improving the health and wellbeing of pupils and
students, in supporting learning and care for environment, and
increasing resilience to climate change. Strategies should maximise
the educational value of green infrastructure with community and
pupil engagement, seasonal planting events and communication
strategies. Targeted Continuing Professional Development for
school staff will increase knowledge and confidence, ensuring
better utilisation of green infrastructure and communication of its
benefits. This will help create a sense of stewardship and increase
ecological literacy. The provision of natural green space and natural
play features on-site or within walking distance will help integrate
the natural world into the curriculum, removing barriers to
learning, particularly time and transport costs.
Strategic site planning should consider the access points into the
site, connected to safe, green, active routes to school or college, to
support healthy and independent travel by children and students,
and to reduce the need for travel by car. Working with the local
authority, connections to an active travel network can be improved
and this can help reduce costs and reduce travel times.
The retrofitting of green infrastructure, for example green roofs and
SuDS, should take account of building structure, topography,
geology, heritage features and archaeology. Rural, suburban, and
urban sites will vary in terms of the extent and types of greening
that can be applied. Whatever is created, robust maintenance
regimes must be included to ensure long-term success.
Application of the GI Standards – Schools and colleges
• Utilise natural settings and experience of nature as a way of
creating diversified learning and play environments.
• Look for opportunities for the education estate’s green space
to be safely used by the wider community as accessible
green space.
• There is no net loss of accessible green space per head of
population at an area-wide level.
• Provide attractive green routes for active travel to and from
education sites.
• There may be opportunities to design green space in this
context to meet Green Flag Award criteria and best practice
in accessibility for all.
• Build on the strong community links of schools to engage
children and families in the design and management of
natural features and to enhance connection with nature.
• Consider introducing species-rich meadows, hedgerows,
and woodland to enhance nature and explore opportunities
to create an area that could become a LNR and form part of
the nature recovery network.
Page 121 of 138
• Consider how sites can contribute to nature recovery and
the creation and restoration of wildlife rich habitats to
deliver local nature recovery objectives, for example though
incorporating features for species, biodiverse green roofs or
rain gardens, species-rich grassland, hedgerows, trees and
woodland or wetland to enhance nature.
• Explore opportunities to enhance or create Local Nature
Reserves or Local Wildlife Sites within schools and colleges.
• Follow Department for Education advice on UGF for
education sites.
• There is no net loss of green cover in urban neighbourhoods.
• Create a variety of green infrastructure including rain
gardens, biodiverse or bio-solar green roofs, green walls,
wildflower, and wetland areas. Design GI so that it provides
opportunities for learning and adopts the principles of
biophilic design.
• Minimise sealed surface to improve water permeability and
create space for sustainable drainage.
• Use planting to provide cleaner air and provide separation
from busy external environments.
• Design to meet locally set urban tree canopy cover uplift
targets.
• Use trees to create shade in playgrounds, to create play
opportunities, and to engage children in seasonal change.
• Consider the resilience of tree species to long term climate
change.

6.12 Healthcare facilities
Healthcare facilities are usually dominated by large buildings or
complexes of buildings and in most locations, large car parks.
Hospitals usually feature amenity landscapes, similar in character
to the incidental plantings found around commercial sites, with
ornamental trees, shrubberies, and amenity grassland.
Retrofitting older hospital buildings with green infrastructure can
be problematic because of structural and operational issues and
the siting of mechanical and electrical plant. However, it is usually
possible to improve hospital grounds to make them more
functional in terms of, for example, sustainable drainage and
replacing amenity grassland with trees or meadows. Recognition of
this is demonstrated by the NHS Forest project, which encourages
local people to plant trees in hospital grounds.
As with schools, where new hospitals and clinics are planned,
development should follow Biodiversity Net Gain requirements as
set out in legislation. Urban Greening Factors may be set by local
authorities or healthcare provider. There may be opportunities to
include green roofs which can save energy on air conditioning and
can also act as a source control method in the sustainable drainage
systems and can also contribute towards a development’s BNG
requirements.
In the healthcare setting there is interest in the therapeutic value of
green infrastructure. This can involve providing accessible planted
terraces and gardens for patients, visitors, and staff, but can also
involve planting that is overlooked from windows, which has been
shown to have a calming effect on patients, reduce the need for
medication and reduce recovery times - shortening hospital stays.
It improves quality of life for both patients and staff.
Gardens can also provide suitable settings for art installations. This
understanding of the therapeutic value of green infrastructure and
the biophilic design philosophy means that new hospitals are now
featuring green roofs, gardens, natural water features, sensory rich
environments, access to nature-rich green space as well as interior
planting. An example of the is the Alder Hey Children’s Hospital in
Liverpool. The Maggie Centres also have a strong connection
between inside and outside planting. In addition to the greening of
buildings, the grounds and vehicle parking areas of hospitals can
include sustainable drainage, dense tree planting and biodiverse
perimeter planting.
Application of the GI Standards – Healthcare facilities
• Look for opportunities to make green space in healthcare
setting accessible to the public.
• Look for opportunities to convert hard landscape to
accessible greenspace.
• Utilise natural settings and sensory experiences of nature as
a way toward creating healing environments for patients,
visitors, staff, and the local community.
• There is no net loss of accessible green space per head of
population at an area-wide level. 
Page 124 of 138
• Provide attractive green active travel commuting routes,
connecting healthcare settings and local residential areas.
• There may be opportunities to design green space in this
context to meet Green Flag Award criteria, and designing to
meet best practice in accessibility for all will be particularly
important in healthcare settings.
• Ensure that greenspaces feel safe, welcoming, and well
maintained to encourage inclusive use.
• Utilise good horticultural design to structure sensory
experience for a wide range of abilities and needs. Connect
users to nature through changing colours, movement, scent,
and wildlife.
• Consider opportunities for nature-based activities as part of
Green Social prescribing initiatives.
• Consider how sites can contribute to nature recovery and
the creation and restoration of wildlife rich habitats to
deliver local nature recovery objectives, for example though
incorporating features for species, biodiverse green roofs or
rain gardens, species-rich grassland, hedgerows, trees and
woodland or wetland to enhance nature.
• Explore opportunities to enhance or create Local Nature
Reserves or Local Wildlife Sites within healthcare settings.
• UGF to significantly increase GI provision to be agreed with
local authorities and healthcare providers.
• There is no net loss of green cover in urban neighbourhoods.
• Create a variety of green infrastructure including rain
gardens, ponds, green roofs, green walls, wildflower
meadows, growing spaces, occupational therapy gardens,
and outdoor gyms.
• Use the perceptual quality of plants and water to create
sensory environments that support mental wellbeing for
staff, patients, visitors, and the local community.
• Minimise sealed surface to improve water permeability and
create space for sustainable drainage.
• Design to meet locally set urban tree canopy cover uplift
targets.
• Design woodlands and orchards as natural spaces for
wellbeing and for shade and to sequester carbon.
• Consider the resilience of tree species to long term climate
change.

6.13 Linear infrastructure (roads, railways,
and waterways)
Linear infrastructure includes road verges, railway embankments
and cuttings and canal and river towpaths. These features are often
lightly managed and densely vegetated and can continue for long
distances, making them some of the most valuable features in
district green infrastructure networks. Where access is restricted
for safety reasons, these areas provide refuges for wildlife. Roads,
however, can be major barriers to movement and a cause of injury
and fatalities for people as well as wildlife. Linear infrastructure can
also create major barriers for pedestrians, particularly children, as
well as cyclists, horse riders and people with disabilities.
Linear infrastructure is often narrow and ecological corridors can
cease to function where vegetation has been removed. Roads are
the source of noise, air, and water pollution, which has a negative
impact on wildlife and people. Roads often direct surface water
runoff directly into watercourses, which is a contributing cause of
poor water quality.
The role in linear infrastructure in providing district wide green
infrastructure networks needs to be more fully acknowledged and
management should be adjusted to take account of the issues and
opportunities. New planting can strengthen existing tree lines and
hedgerows. The use of sustainable drainage systems to intercept
and clean surface water run-off from roads should be expanded.
Good progress has been made in some counties in adjusting
management of grass verges to encourage longer more species-rich
swards in suitable locations, however, more can be done.
Plate 29: Traffic-free route and ecological corridor associated with
railway. Credit: Green Infrastructure Consultancy
Where roads and railways pollute and disturb nearby residents,
more use of green infrastructure, including narrow vertical features
like hedges and green walls, can be made. Where roads constitute
a barrier to the movement of people and wildlife, more can be done
to provide green bridges, underpasses, and ducts, depending on
the species affected. Bridges for people can be modified to make
them greener and more suitable for as crossing points for wildlife,
particularly mammals, reptiles, and amphibians. Green bridges can
be designed in from the outset in new schemes, helping to connect
important landscapes, habitats and foraging sites and providing
crossing points for people and wildlife.

Figure 27: Green infrastructure along urban waterways
Page 129 of 138
Along river valleys, there are opportunities to create more longdistance cycle paths, bridleways, and footpaths. Most rivers have
been modified and there are usually opportunities to restore
wetlands and reconnect the floodplain with watercourses and
waterways. Access improvements can be fully integrated with flood
management, water quality and biodiversity objectives and can
provide further opportunities to improve access for people. There
is often space within the floodplain (which is usually unsuitable for
urban development) to create regionally important parks (see for
example Bedford River Valley Park).
As part of Biodiversity Net Gain implementation, linear green
infrastructure features that are found within the biodiversity metric
can count towards a project’s BNG requirement. Offsite linear green
infrastructure could also provide biodiversity units that could be
made available in the BNG market, as long as this provision
complies with the regulations e.g., is legally secured, registered and
meets the additionality rules.
Application of the GI Standards – Linear infrastructure
(roads, railways, and waterways)
• Linear corridors can be accessible greenspaces. Consider
how linear corridors could contribute to meeting Accessible
Greenspace Standards and local capacity standards.
• In rural areas aim to reflect the habitats found in the wider
landscape. In urban areas, create accessible corridors that
provide sensory experience, shade, and tranquillity.
• Linear corridors can provide attractive green routes for
active travel, connecting green spaces to residential areas
and other facilities.
• There is no net loss of accessible green space per head of
population at an area-wide level.
• Linear corridors can be designed to meet many of the Green
Flag Award criteria and best practice in accessibility for all.
• Ensure access along linear infrastructure is well signed and
maintained appropriately (with biodiversity in mind, this
may mean reduced mowing regimes). Ensure linear routes
are accessible to a wide variety of users where possible.
Provide strategic crossings for both people and nature.
• Consider opportunities for linear corridors and the activities
they support to be part of Green Social prescribing
initiatives.
• Consider how linear features can contribute to nature
recovery and the creation and restoration of wildlife rich
habitats to deliver local nature recovery objectives, for 
Page 130 of 138
example though incorporating features for species,
biodiverse green roofs or rain gardens, species-rich
grassland, hedgerows, trees and woodland, and wetland to
enhance nature.
• Explore opportunities to enhance or create Local Nature
Reserves or Local Wildlife Sites along linear corridors.
• Consider how urban linear features can contribute to
meeting UGF of 0.3 for predominately commercial and 0.4
for predominately residential developments or area wide
greening standards.
• There is no net loss of green cover in urban neighbourhoods.
• Designs reflect the importance of linear infrastructure in the
wider GI network. Use GI interventions to increase ecological
connectivity and reduce severance of habitats caused by
transport and other linear infrastructure.
• Design linear features with green infrastructure that
attenuates urban runoff and improves water quality e.g.,rain
gardens and sustainable drainage systems, and connects to
the wider blue infrastructure network.
• Consider opportunities for using the linear green estate to
generate renewable energy.
• Design to meet locally set urban tree canopy cover uplift
targets.
• Use tree and hedgerow planting to screen visual, air and
noise pollution where appropriate and to sequester carbon.
• Consider the resilience of tree species to long term climate
change.
• New and existing trees are incorporated into linear
infrastructure and new streets are tree lined. Consider the
resilience of tree species to long term climate change.
