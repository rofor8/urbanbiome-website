0 Executive summary
The target of this document is the definition of a catalogue of Nature Base Solutions (NBS) that
include all the possible characteristics (technical, economic, environmental, and social) of each
one of them; in order to be able to select the best options to introduce them in the development
of a RUP, allowing the definition of different scenarios, which have been evaluated to define its
viability and impact to improve the behaviour of the city regarding the climate change
challenges.
During the process, features of each NBS identified have been taken into account, in order to be
able to describe the impact of the technology since economic, environmental, social and
aesthetical issues, for which it has been necessary to identify the KPIs that have been taking into
account in each implementation for measuring the behaviour of NBS, as well as the qualitative
features. On the other hand, the process of implementation and the stakeholders that take part
on it has also been taken into account.
This catalogue allows to identify solutions taking different criteria’s depending on characteristics
of the city/area, problems, challenges, budget, social issues, climate, previous experiences, etc.

1 Introduction
Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) have emerged as an approach to promoting sustainability in urban
areas, due to the growing number of people living in our cities (approximately 70% of the current
European Union population). The impacts this has on building density and the use of
environmental resources has affected the functionality of many socio-economic and ecological
systems and the delivery of ecosystem services. This includes the pollution and overuse of water
and terrestrial resources, exacerbation of natural hazards, decline in quality of life, and
degradation of air quality, leading to a myriad of impacts on the quality of urban environments
and their human populations, with significant implications for the sustainability and economic
viability of European cities.

To counteract these impacts, the European Commission (2015) is supporting research and
practical delivery of NBS in urban areas through the Horizon 2020 programme. The programme
adds to the evidence base that investment in “nature”, in its many forms, can act as a viable
solution to constantly changing urban circumstances. Based on the promotion of ecosystem
services2 and the connective3, accessible4 and multi-functional5 principles of green infrastructure
(GI)6, NBS are being promoted as a smarter way to integrate ecological thinking into engineered
(i.e. built environment) systems (Liquete et al., 2016). NBS is not an entirely new concept, as a
wealth of evidence exists discussing the value of investment in urban nature (cf. the urban
ecology literature, Niemelä, 1999; Wu, 2014).

However, the promotion of “nature” as the central principle of investment does differ from
previous forms of green space and landscape development (Nesshöver et al., 2016). By working
with nature as a core delivery goal, rather than against it or as an afterthought, investments in
NBS can offer cost-effective, innovative and responsive forms of urban management which can
support greener and more sustainable growth in Europe’s cities (Eggermont et al., 2015; Fan et

2

Ecosystem services are composed on regulating, supporting, provisioning and cultural services, all of which help regulate the
functionality of environmental resources (Ahern, Cilliers, & Niemelä, 2014; Hansen & Pauleit, 2014).
3 Connectivity refers to the physical or spatial layout of green infrastructure resources and is connections to other comparable or
supporting resources. Connectivity can be achieved through the provision of linking landscape features such a river corridors or
footpaths, and uses the conceptual understanding of networks and systems to support green infrastructure functionality (Austin,
2014).
4 Accessibility refers to ways in which human and non-human populations can access green infrastructure resources. This includes a
reflection on the location of a green infrastructure site in relation to local people, the barriers to engagement or use, i.e. fences,
locked gates or transport infrastructure, and the distance a resource is from its user population (Mell, 2016).
5 Within the green infrastructure literature ‘multi-functionality’ is discussed as the co-location of social, economic and ecological
benefits in a single location or across a green infrastructure network. Multi-functionality does not imply that social, economic and
ecological benefits are required to be located in all spaces but argues that homogenous spaces are more likely to promote monofunctional uses/benefits compared to those green infrastructure that are composed of a diverse set of landscape resources (Benedict
& McMahon, 2006; Mell, 2016).
6 Green infrastructure was defined by Benedict & McMahon (2002:6) in a North American context as: “Green infrastructure is our
nation’s natural life support system — an interconnected network of waterways, wetlands, woodlands, wildlife habitats, and other
natural areas; greenways, parks and other conservation lands; working farms, ranches and forests; and wilderness and other open
spaces that support native species, maintain natural ecological processes, sustain air and water resources and contribute to the
health and quality of life for America’s communities and people.”

al., 2017). Unfortunately, the understanding and capacity within government and the
environmental and business sectors to implement NBS varies spatially and across governance
levels (local, regional, state, and national) and between institutions and organisations (Kabisch
et al., 2016). Consequently, although advocates are arguing for investment in NBS, there remains
a limited understanding of the added value that NBS can provide in urban development. This
compounds the technical, legal and political challenges faced by practitioners, scientists and
decision-makers working in cognate sustainability disciplines, who struggle to integrate the
growing body of evidence supporting investment in green infrastructure, ecosystem services
and NBS into environmental management and urban planning practices (Lewinsohn et al., 2015;
Nesshöver et al., 2016).
To address this disparity, the main goals of the European Commission (2015) are to ensure that
NBS and the Re-Naturing of Cities deliver the following through its Horizon 2020 funded projects
and its wider programme of research and implementation:
1.

Enhance the framework conditions for nature-based solutions at EU policy level
Develop a European Research and Innovation Community for nature-based solutions
Provide the evidence and knowledge base for nature-based solutions
Advance the development, uptake and upscale of innovative nature-based solutions
Mainstream NBS within the international Research & Innovation agenda.

This paper discusses the proposed meanings, uses and limitations of a NBS approach to
managing urban areas. Drawing on a range of academic and practitioner material, it illustrates
where complementarity between locations, policies and approaches exist, as well as identifying
where gaps in our knowledge of NBS remain. This frames the discussion of NBS through its
definitions and its use in practice, and is followed by an analysis of how NBS are being articulated
within the accompanying academic/practitioner literature. In each of the following sections, the
added value that NBS can provide to urban planners and managers is highlighted, in conjunction
with the existing issues which limit the integration of NBS into development programmes.

1.1 What is a Nature Based Solution?
Several definitions have been proposed for NBS in the academic and practitioner literature,
many of which reflect the proposals made by the European Commission when they stated that
NBS are:

‘solutions that are inspired and supported by nature, which are cost-effective,
simultaneously provide environmental, social and economic benefits and help
build resilience’

Within this definition, the European Commission approach NBS as a method of providing added
socio-economic value to existing approaches, using ecological systems and functions to address

societal and ecological challenges in urban environments. The European Commission’s use of
‘resilience’ terminology couches their thinking in an understanding that the governance of urban
areas is directly linked to the decisions being made regarding economic stability and social,
which are all tied to the inclusiveness, functionality and quality of life of urban landscapes
(Kabisch et al., 2016). Thus, NBS are offered as a mechanism to promote resilience within sociopolitical discussions of landscape and urban development.
The ability of an urban environment to be, primarily, economically and, latterly, socially and
ecologically vibrant has been proposed as being of paramount importance to the on-going
promotion of NBS as an alternative of established built environment forms of development (Fan
et al., 2017; Maes & Jacobs, 2017). NBS as a concept has the potential to help re-orient urban
planning processes in a productive way, offering something above and beyond the concepts of
sustainability and resilience. Rather than conserving the existing resource base, they shift the
focus to improving and proactively adapting and mitigating social and environmental challenges
in urban areas through ecological investment. To that end, Fan et al. (2017) state that research
focussing on NBS is shifting the emphasis of development towards a recalibration of the pillars
of sustainability towards a nature-centric hierarchy. Thus, Fan et al., Fink (2016) and Kabisch et
al. (2016) argue that NBS are being promoted as a mechanism to rethink the primacy placed
upon economic viability issues; placing environment at the heart of development in a way that
is also economically tenable.
These discussions counter the established narrative of urban development by offering NBS as a
comparable and, critically, more effective method of achieving ecological resilience to the
impacts of socio-economic and physical change in urban areas. The benefits of ecologicallycentred investment include the delivery of comparable benefits to engineered solutions but they
are less expensive and more reactive to changes in the fabric of an urban environment (van
Wesenbeeck et al., 2014); thus they offer a more dynamic tool for alleviating the pressures of
urban landscapes (Eggermont et al., 2015). It is further suggested that NBS provide a mechanism
to optimise the benefits of ecological systems within the built environment, promoting a more
nuanced appreciation of “nature” within urban policy and planning practice to ensure different
stakeholders can more effectively engage with NBS and traditional engineered solutions.
Eggermont et al.'s (2015) proposal argues that NBS is a hybrid concept combining several
different ecological approaches to management simultaneously, such as ecosystem services and
GI, enabling its advocates to align discussions nature-focussed interventions with more
established forms of urban development (see also Pontee et al., 2016). NBS thus potentially offer
a wider portfolio of investment and management options for city planners and governments
that have been promoted as being adaptable to urban change when compared to current built
environment techniques (Nesshöver et al., 2016). This suggests that NBS may also offer a more
viable means to address the divergent needs of diverse stakeholders while promoting multifunctionality and accessibility (Eggermont et al., 2015). Thus, NBS are proposed as shifting the
emphasis of urban development away from simply meeting the needs of a location in terms of
transport, housing and commerce by “learning” from previous green space/landscape
management to integrate new, i.e. urban pollinators or moveable gardens and existing

approaches to “urban nature”, i.e. sustainable urban drainage or investment in urban greening,
within a flexible approach to environmental management focussing on specific solutions to
identified problems (Kabisch et al., 2016).
In addition, Kabisch et al. (2016) argue that the ability of NBS to address multiple socio-economic
and ecological issues enables users to think more innovatively about how to release pressures
on land, management and policy. This can be seen in Balian, Eggermont, & Le Roux’s (2014)
definition of NBS:
‘…the use of nature in tackling challenges such as climate change, food security,
water resources, or disaster risk management, encompassing a wider definition
of how to conserve and use biodiversity in a sustainable manner.’ (p.5)

Nesshöver et al. (2016) present a more detailed exploration of these issues, reviewing both the
International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and European Commission
approaches to NBS. In their discussion, they highlight the role of NBS in promoting health and
well-being, solutions for water management and climate change, and societal challenges such
as food security that NBS can help mitigate. The scope of their analysis may prove too broad for
some commentators but they argue that by using NBS within urban design and implementation
strategies that the utility of natural systems that reflect on the diversity of nature rather than
the more static approaches to investment currently witnessed in urban development. This
extends the previous debate by suggesting, via the IUCN definition, that NBS offer multiple and
simultaneous benefits which can address societal, economic and ecological issues within a
nature-centric form of management (Baig et al., 2015; Cohen-Shacham et al., 2016; European
Commission, 2015). The diversity and flexibility of NBS, and their capacity to address multiple
challenges in a way that is tailored to local areas, also means that they address the main
shortcomings of existing environmental management approaches (Boyd and Folke, 2011;
Chaffin et al. 2014; Clement et al. 2016a). All of this suggests that NBS have the potential, which
is currently being evidence via the Horizon 2020 and EKLIPSE programmes, to offer a more
comprehensive and effective means of responding to environmental change and building social
and ecological resilience.
Building on the European Commission’s succinct definition of NBS discussed earlier, the
Commission proposed a more extensive definition of NBS that aims to provide a more robust
basis for its use:
‘Nature-based solutions aim to help societies address a variety of environmental,
social and economic challenges in sustainable ways. They are actions inspired by,
supported by or copied from nature; both using and enhancing existing solutions
to challenges, as well as exploring more novel solutions, for example, mimicking
how non-human organisms and communities cope with environmental extremes.
Nature-based solutions use the features and complex system processes of nature,
such as its ability to store carbon and regulate water flows, in order to achieve

URBAN GreenUP
GA nº 730426

D1.: NBS Catalogue

18 / 225

desired outcomes, such as reduced disaster risk and an environment that
improves human well-being and socially inclusive green growth. This implies that
maintaining and enhancing natural capital is of crucial importance, as it forms the
basis for solutions. These nature-based solutions ideally are resilient to change, as
well as energy and resource efficient, but in order to achieve these criteria, they
must be adapted to local conditions.
The “nature-based solution” concept builds on and supports other closely related
concepts, such as the ecosystem approach, ecosystem services, ecosystem-based
adaptation/mitigation, and green and blue infrastructure. They all recognise the
importance of nature and require a systemic approach to environmental change
based on an understanding of the structure and functioning of ecosystems,
including human actions and their consequences. Nature-based solutions,
however, have a distinctive set of premises: (i) some societal challenges stem from
human activities that have failed to recognize ecological limitations; (ii)
sustainable alternatives to those activities can be found by looking to nature for
design and process knowledge. They therefore involve the innovative application
of knowledge about nature, inspired and supported by nature, and they maintain
and enhance natural capital. They are positive responses to societal challenges,
and can have the potential to simultaneously meet environmental, social and
economic objectives.’
European Commission (2015:24)
This more extensive presentation of the European Commission’s proposals for NBS provides
greater detail and focus for member states, allowing them to work more effectively with the
concept when compared to other, and more succinct definitions (cf. Balian, Eggermont, & Le
Roux, 2014).
Central to this expanded definition is the maintenance and/or enhancing of natural capital, as
this provides the most basic elements from which NBS can be derived to deliver socio-economic
and ecological solutions. In addition, NBS acknowledge that human interactions with the
landscape can be both positive and negative (Cohen-Shacham et al., 2016; Raymond et al.,
2017). This contrasts to the wider literature debating engineered solutions which promote
positive assessments of human-orientated landscape management stating that non-ecological
solutions have also been successfully addressed climatic, water and ecological problems
(Firehock, 2015). NBS, however, argue against this narrative stating that investment in “nature”
should be promoted in the place of engineered approaches to address both the design and
practical solutions derived from traditional development practices. Thus, NBS provide a platform
for practitioners and stakeholders to rethink both their development and management practices
by placing innovative environmental and nature based options at the heart of development,
management and design in urban areas.

The question may arise, is the Nature-Base Solution exactly the same as Nature-Base
Technology? The difference may be determined by scale. All the NBS or NBT should support/be
a part/or related to urban/local systemic approach, like ecosystem service, ecosystem-based
adaptation/mitigation, and green and blue infrastructure.

1.2 What is an NBS catalogue?
Nature- Based Solutions Catalogue (NBSC) is a part of the URBAN Green UP modular
methodology, for Renaturing Urban Planning concept (RUP) which incorporates the urban
planning aspects directly related with the nature-based solutions as a part of the Sustainable
Urban Planning, to support the direct implementation of one or a set of NBSs in a specific area
of the city to address also specific challenges in a more effective way.
In practice, it is a kind of an NBS implementation assistant-repository, and includes existing
information about NBS, technical, economic and social aspects, in a standard way to be used in
a systemic procedure of planning or decision making.

1.3 What are the objectives of an NBS catalogue?
The key role of the catalogue is to act as a central reference in the development of Renaturing
Urban Plans (RUPs) by presenting a set of NBS options, each of which will have been built in at
least one of the participating cities in the Urban GreenUP project.
Not every NBS in this catalogue will suit every part of every city. The RUP development process
serves to enable selection of appropriate NBS from the catalogue for each city, recognising that
a wide array of factors will be relevant in determining the suitability of an individual NBS. These
factors include:






The built forms of the city
The budget the city holds for NBS deployment, and its ability to leverage funding
The challenges that the city wishes to address using NBS
The social, cultural, legal and political context of the city
The ability of relevant institutions to design, construct and maintain NBS

These factors mean that of the NBS outlined in this document, different cities may opt to deploy
entirely different selections in very different spatial patterns and with different governance and
financial arrangements. This NBS catalogue identifies the key traits of each NBS, serving as the
foundation of the RUP process, including costs (capital and maintenance), key ecosystem
services provided, scale and a brief description of the NBS itself.

A number of other methodological outputs in the Urban GreenUP project will support cities in
their selection from the NBS options outlined in this catalogue as they work toward
development of individual long-term RUPs.

1.4 Definition of concepts
1.4.1 Challenges
The standardization of the method is one of the most relevant milestones of URBAN GreenUP
objectives. For that reason, a parameterisation is needed. Challenges previously identified by
the bibliography as well as any other challenges that could be identified during the research
processes. The parameterisation will allow identifying the factors that influence each challenge
to analyse and assess them, in quantitative and/or qualitative technique according to each case
and evaluate the city in respect of each city challenge and their own diagnostic.
EKLIPSE help us as a basis and it is integrated in the Project Methodology as a decision-making.

Climate change mitigation and adaptation: This concept includes the capacity to react
and respond to an external stimulus or stress such as climate change, and the potential of
improving the current status of a parameter or driver through active or passive behaviour, in
this case through reducing greenhouse gas emissions or sequestering carbon.

Water management: How the NBS can contribute to solve the three principal problems:
flood risk, water scarcity and water quality.
Coastal resilience: This concept refers to the ability of coastal ecosystems to reorganize
keeping its functions, structure, identity and regenerative capacity when they are threatened.
NBS can increase coastal resilience by protecting communities against extreme events.
Green space management: Green spaces are important reservoirs of urban biodiversity,
providing resources, ecosystem services and habitats for species of interest, improving
functional and structural connectivity at the urban level.
Air quality: NBS based on the creation, enhancement, or restoration of ecosystems in
human-dominated environments play a relevant role in removing air pollutants and carbon
dioxide, reducing the air temperature (which slows down the creation of secondary pollutants)
and increasing oxygen concentration, contributing to a beneficial atmospheric composition for
human life.

Urban regeneration: This concepts aims at improvements in the economic, physical, social
and environmental conditions of an urban area that has been subject to negative change and is
considered non-resilient. NBS projects need to harmonize urban regeneration, aesthetic appeal,
urban development, urban structure, design, social justice, urban ecology and its relations to
energy and water uses.

Participatory planning and governance: NBS design and implementation require a holistic
and transdisciplinary planning approach that conciliates different types of knowledge.
Furthermore, NBS must focus on the interests and perceptions of citizens, examining the
changes in policy narratives when incorporating the ecosystem services framework in planning.

Social justice and social cohesion: This concepts aims at comprising the environmental
justice and social cohesion supported by NBS in urban areas, through a multi-dimensional
approach.

Public Health and Well-being: NBS can contribute to a wide range of positive
psychological and physiological benefits, improving overall human health.
Potential of economic opportunities and green jobs: Increasing green areas and NBS
results in considerable economic benefits (increased real estate values, positive health effects,
improved water management…). In addition, NBS generate co-benefits that can create
opportunities for “Green businesses” and “Green-Collar Jobs”.

1.4.2 Ecosystem services provided
First of all, we have to know that an ecosystem is a dynamic complex of plant, animal, and
microorganism communities and the non-living environment, interacting as a functional unit.
Humans are an integral part of ecosystems.7
The ecosystem services are “the benefits people obtain from ecosystems”3, in other words “the
direct and indirect contributions of ecosystems to human wellbeing” 8.
There are several classifications of ecosystem services. The most used classifications can be
found in the Ecosystems and human well-being a framework for assessment3, in The Economics
of Ecosystems and Biodiversity: Ecological and Economic Foundations4 and in the Common
International Classification of Ecosystem Services (CICES 2013).
In this catalogue we are going to use the classification of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment.
The MA categorized ecosystem services into four categories:





Provisioning Services: These are the products obtained from ecosystems.
Regulating: Indirect benefits from nature generated through regulation of
ecosystem processes.
Cultural: Non-material benefits from nature.
Supporting: Fundamental ecological processes that support the delivery of
other ecosystem services.

Urban catchment forestry

Rain gardens

€40 /m2
A rain garden is a bioretention shallow basin designed to
collect, store, filter and treat water runoff. To optimise its
functions, it must include a porous soil mixture, native
vegetation and some hyperaccumulator plants, capable of
phytoremediation. The plants in Rain gardens must cope
with dry and with wet conditions.12

The drainage patterns of towns and cities have been
modified greatly. Catchment areas for water are now
based on road and building layout, with underground
sewer system taking on the role of the streams and rivers
as the collecting and discharge points for water in the city.
This NBS is based on renaturing these urban catchments by
planting urban trees, with specific design to “slow the
flow” of water through the catchment. The impact of wellplanned urban catchment forestry interventions is reduced
flood risk and a reduced amount of polluted water entering
the sewerage system.

Description

Focussed on de-culverting watercourses in urban areas to
provide opportunities to daylight. This involves excavating
water courses and the removal of built infrastructure to
‘daylight’ the water channel. The process can support more
effective flood risk management as it provides
opportunities to re-naturalise water courses/corridors
using NBS. Daylighting can also promote ecological and
habitat diversity. There are also possibilities to utilities to
improve their waste water/sewage management and
treatment.

Removal of the existing concrete river banks of channel
and replace it with a modular green system called
Terramesh walls that stabilise earth embankment and
create green slopes by requiring vegetation.

Floodable park

Main
Challenge

NBS

A floodable park basically consists on a vegetated
detention basin designed for short term temporal water
storage by using an existing natural depression in the
ground or by creating a new one. Floodable parks are free
from water in dry weather flow conditions whereas in wet
weather flow conditions excess surface run-off or excess
water flow from rivers, streams, open channels, which may
lead to flooding episodes, can be temporary stored. After
the flood episode is over, stored water may be slowly
drained out to a nearby watercourse, using an outlet
control structure to control the flow rate.

Green filter area

Water treatment

Category

33 / 225

Green filter is a land application system for treating water
(wastewater). It consists of a plot area, sized according to
the influent to be treated, which has forests installed and
is irrigated with wastewater.
The residual water partially evaporates and the rest is
taken up by the roots of trees and filtered through the soil.
Before application to the soil, it is desirable to introduce a
primary treatment system, to remove coarse solids, sand,
grease and solids. But these systems provide more than
just simple purification, because while treating the water,
we are also producing biomass with high economic value.

improving soil fertility; its porous structure enabling
increased absorption of pollutants from urban surfacewater run-off and the slow release of plant nutrients.
Improving soil functioning; providing soil nutrients for
increased vegetation growth in NBS (increased net primary

NBS

In climate-smart urban farming precinct there is smart soil
production area targeting dense urban areas, poor with

have a combined or individual applications of different
types of biochar.

Smart soil as substrate

Category

37 / 225

With this NBS there are water and carbon savings per unit
area and eliminated discontinuity risk of agricultural
production due to climate change.
Different types of smart soils can be elaborated from
agrofood sludge and biomass (biochar). The properties of
NOx fixation and self-fertilizer are achieved through the
addition of encapsulated bacteria which accelerate the
nitrogen cycle of the soil, increasing the absorption of
atmospheric pollutants and the concentration of nitrates
available for plants in the soil. These innovative soils could
be used in several NBS.
The technosoils contain a large amount of organic matter
which improves the availability of nutrients and better
holding water capacity which reduces the amount of
irrigation needed.

Urban orchards are areas of land dedicated to the organic
cultivation of vegetables or fruits and flowers. The activity
needs regular irrigation and regular intervention in order
to maintain the agronomic conditions to cultivate.
These organic surfaces are located in the urban areas. In
general,
non-profit
associations,
neighbourhood
associations or the city council are the usual management
entities.
Unemployed, retired people, families with limited
resources or people interested in it usually are in charge of
exploiting them. Urban orchards are considered social
spaces where people and families achieve/obtain profits
from nature and healthy vegetables from orchards.

Community composting activity is a method for treating
solid waste in which organic material is broken down by
microorganisms in the presence of oxygen to a point where
it can be safely stored, handled and applied to the
environment as a fertilizer and soil amendment. Organic
material is delivered from the community and commercial
activities: urban allotments, small-scale urban livestock,
nearby restaurants, markets, fruit stores, etc. The objective
is to close the loop on organics recovery. Likewise, this NBS
has educational and engagement purposes.

Green Route

Cycle and pedestrian green route

TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION

GRAPHIC DETAIL

Cycle and pedestrian green route is the part of green networks in the city. It characterized
by pathways that provide recreational, public health and well-being opportunities, as well
as transportation linkages (Figure 1). It serves to connect cyclists and pedestrians to nature.
In this sense, this new generation multi-objective greenways go beyond recreation and
beautification to address such areas as habitat needs of wildlife, promoting urban flood
damage reduction, enhancing water quality, providing a resource for outdoor education,
and other green infrastructure objectives (Searns, 1995).
Cycle and pedestrian green route combine natural planting or water systems together with
paths for people on foot or by bike deliver a range of benefits:
• Improve bicycle and pedestrian transportation
• Improve public health through active living
• Enhance biodiversity (clear skies, clean rivers, and protected biological reserves)
• Enhance cultural awareness and community identity
Benefit is realized depends largely on the nature and types of the cycle and pedestrian
green route system being implemented:
• Newly planned: This type of cycle and pedestrian green route integrates other
nature-base solutions (i.e. shading trees, green pavement) with active travel
modes together from the start (Figure 2).


Retrofitted: This requires existing or abandoned roads/routes implemented
together with other nature-based solutions.

Water Management

Water can cause tremendous damage to paths and
pools of water spoils a cycle journey and walking
experience. Creation of cambers or falls across
paths can reduce flooding when it rains. It is also
vital to use permeable material to drain away the
rainwater. This can also allow water penetrates
down and feeds the groundwater (Sustrans Design
Manual, 2014).

Copenhagen Green Routes experience illustrates
benefits of these routes for stormwater management
(CSGN, 2018). Networks of cycling and pedestrian
green routes safeguard water quality, provide habitat
for plants and reduce downstream flooding (Walmsley,
2006).

S

Cyclists and pedestrians are exposed to higher air
pollution levels than motor vehicle occupants.
Cycle and pedestrian green route contain buffer
green that can enhance air quality by absorbing
certain airborne pollutants from the atmosphere.

Studies on air quality reported that vegetation barriers
and trees along roads/routes reduce roadside pollutant
concentrations (Abhijitha et al., 2017). Green cycle and
pedestrian routes alleviate automobile congestion and
traffic-related air and noise pollution (Cavill and Davis,
2007).

U/S

Copenhagen has implemented 58 km of integrated
‘Green Walking and Cycle Routes’ across a city with a
ratio of typically 20% pedestrians to 80% cyclists. These
routes are attractive to diverse range of people.
Copenhagen experience indicates that 20% of users
were found to be new cyclists to the area (CSGN, 2018).

TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION

GRAPHIC DETAIL

This NBS includes individual large street trees, as well as the larger areas of
woodland in the urban fringes. Trees perform multiple functions in urban areas.
The following are five types of NBS that arboreal interventions can provide:
Urban trees are a vital element of our green infrastructure. There is a vast
worldwide literature on the development, delivery and management of the
urban forest. Strategic positioning of large shade and cooling trees within
urban areas can provide shade to buildings, reducing heat loading on building
and provide islands of respite from high temperatures in our urban areas.
Vacant or derelict areas in our towns and cities are often converted to
temporary areas for car parking.
Around the densely developed centres of our urban areas are often larger areas
of woodland, providing a wider range of NBS. Creating new woodland areas,
linking the dense urban centres with the rural hinterland can provide a rich
resource for NBS to help achieve future sustainable growth.
Each intervention will be designed to meet the objectives of the landowner, be
appropriate to its context (right tree in the right place) and achieve multiple
benefits.

Climate change
mitigation &
adaptation

Tree and woodland planting is a highly costeffective and achievable way to reduced carbon
dioxide and helps us adapt to likely changes in
climate. Species selected include those are
resistant to disease and which transpire at high
rates to maximise their cooling effect. Provision of
a constant water supply to such trees is essential
to ensure this function is effective. Wooded areas
also support coastal resilience against natural
disasters

Water Management

Urban trees have a high propensity to intercept
and abate runoff following extreme weather
events, when compared not only against
impervious surfaces, but also against other forms
of naturally permeable land cover types, including
lawns. Arboreal areas can alleviate the impacts of
flooding in urban areas.

Green Space
Management

Strategic species choice in planting urban and
peri-urban trees can support biodiversity by
providing important wildlife corridors in a
fragmented landscape.

Challenge
Scale

A review by Gago et al (2013) found that strategic tree
planting reduces the intensity of the urban heat island
effect. Analysis by Scharenbroch (2012) found that
current urban tree populations have the capacity to
sequester moderate amounts of carbon.
Research by Foster et al, 2011 around coastal resilience
is particularly significant because a growing majority of
the world’s largest cities exist within coastal zones
(Neumann et al, 2015), and projected impacts of
climate change include rising sea levels and intensifying
weather variability and volatility (Lennon et al, 2014;
Tibbetts, 2015).
A study by Armson et al (2013) found that urban surface
water runoff was reduced by as much as 62% where
trees and tree pits were present, in comparison with
areas of continuous asphalt. They also found that one
young tree, planted in a small pit over an impermeable
asphalt surface, can reduce urban surface water runoff
by around 60%, even during winter dormancy.
Alvey (2013) highlights the importance of urban trees
along streets and within parks to address issues
associated with biodiversity loss, including biotic
homogenisation.
Wildlife corridors are important in helping to overcome
habitat fragmentation, enabling species to reach sparse
resources, and ensuring that populations of species do

The planting urban and peri-urban trees, with
careful consideration of location and species, can
mitigate urban air pollution.

Abhijith et al (2017) found that trees improve urban air
quality by increased pollutant deposition and
dispersion, if species choice and management practices
are appropriate for the immediate physical
environment.
Jones et al (2017) point out that trees intercept and
capture airborne pollutants at intensities that depend
upon the location and extent of vegetation. Arboreal
areas outside of urban areas, for example, mitigate
higher levels of ammonia.

U/S

In North West England, a view of a natural landscape
added up to 18% to property value, and residents in
peri-urban settings are willing to pay £7,680 per
household for views of broadleaved woods (Cousins
and Land Use Consultants, 2009).

M/U

The multi-functionality of urban and peri-urban
trees, and the diverse range of potential
beneficiaries, necessitate extensive stakeholder
engagement in planning for implementation, and
allows for interdisciplinary input.

In a social research report, states that there are
multifarious social and political processes and
structures that influence decision-making around
street tree planting alone; these extend beyond
legislation, ownership, policy, standards, organisational
structure, cultural norms, and social networks.

U/S

The planting of urban trees and peri-urban trees
can improve safety and community strength.

It was reported by Dandy (2010) that urban trees can
have a ‘safety value,’ with inverse correlations found
between increased greenspace (including tree cover)

The planting and renewal of trees can facilitate
urban and peri-urban regeneration by adding
amenity value to an area, with an increase in
property value seen where tree cover is increased.

The planting of urban trees can support physical

within urban areas provide shade and evaporative
cooling that help keep neighbourhood’s cooler.
Tree lined streets encourages walking and cycling
which increase levels of physical activity.
Managing and improving arboreal areas around
urban areas can support local employment.

Controlling for confounding factors, an increase in
urban tree cover is associated with improved mental
health (Willis & Petrokofsky, 2017).

another purpose of the action and trees such as Tilia cordata, Platanus orientalis
and Pistacia terebinthus will be planted to increase the shadow surface area and
to help to reduce the effects of heat island.
Air purification by means of removal of Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Ozone (O3),
Sulphur Dioxide (SO2), and PM10 particulate matter is one of the other effects of
urban carbon sink.
With all these urban green areas provide many valuable ecosystem services such
as regulating storm water infiltration, improving air quality, reducing urban heat

TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION

GRAPHIC DETAIL

SUDS are drainage systems that are considered to be environmentally beneficial,
causing minimal or no long-term detrimental damage. They are often regarded
as a sequence of management practices, control structures and strategies
designed to efficiently and sustainably drain surface water, while minimising
pollution and managing the impact on water quality of local water bodies.
SuDS take inspiration from natural features and processes like uptake of water
by plants, soil infiltration, pools, ponds, marshes, wetlands, springs, streams and
rivers.
SuDS work by holding rainwater back, treating pollution and releasing it slowly,
without overwhelming the watercourse or sewer system into which it flows,
thereby reducing flooding.
SuDS are more sustainable than traditional drainage methods because they:
 Manage runoff volumes and flow rates from hard surfaces, reducing the
impact of urbanisation on flooding
 Provide opportunities for using runoff where it falls
 Protect or enhance water quality (reducing pollution from runoff)
 Protect natural flow regimes in watercourses
 Are sympathetic to the environment and the needs of the local
community
 Provide an attractive habitat for wildlife in urban watercourses
 Provide opportunities for evapotranspiration from vegetation and
surface water
 Encourage natural groundwater/aquifer recharge (where appropriate)

 Create better places to live, work and play.
SuDS can take many forms, both above and below ground. Some types of SuDS
include planting, others include proprietary/manufactured products. In general
terms, SuDS that are designed to manage and use rainwater close to where it
falls, on the surface and incorporating vegetation, tend to provide the greatest
benefits. Most SuDS schemes use a combination of SuDS components to
achieve the overall design objectives for the site.

Climate change
mitigation &
adaptation

SUDS can replace some of the evaporative cooling
lost through urbanisation, and can therefore
provide climate change adaptation and mitigation
against Urban Heat Island (UHI) effects. Vegetated
SUDS devices provide the means to regulate
climate, intercept stormwater and sequester or
capture carbon leading to economic impacts of
increased house prices and lowered energy costs
(Tratalos et al. 2007).

SUDS can reduce local average air temperatures by up
to 1°C (URSULA project). Wanphen and Nagano (2009)
suggest that green roofs can reduce building surface
temperatures as well as those in the surrounding
atmosphere and hence reduce the need for air
conditioning.

Air Quality

The SuDS approach involves slowing down and
reducing the quantity of surface water runoff from
a developed area to manage downstream flood
risk, and reducing the risk of that runoff causing
pollution. This is achieved by harvesting,
infiltrating, slowing, storing, conveying and
treating runoff on site and, where possible, on the
surface rather than underground.

The occurrence of SUDS solutions such as green
roofs, rain gardens and swales can contribute to
increase biodiversity locally. The SUDS solutions
and the water cycle is becoming the focal point
when creating green corridors and resilient cities
by integrating nature into urban life.
Some SUDs components (eg trees, green roofs,
green walls, swales, basins) can have a positive

Green roof can absorb up to 100% of incident rainfall,
dependent on conditions, and regionally with only 10%
of roofs greened, a 2.7% reduction in storm water
runoff can result, with a 54% average reduction in
runoff per individual building (Mentens et al. 2006).
TSS, NH4+-N and COD could be effectively removed by
grassed swale, and the removal rate of these pollutants
are significantly correlated with hydraulic detention
time, void fraction of surface clay and adsorption
capability of plant roots.,

It is possible to choose a strategy for the chosen plants
in SUDS elements to support certain insects (i.e. bees,
butterflies) and thereby birdlife, amphibians and/or

SuDS provide opportunities to create visually
attractive green (vegetated and landscaped) and
blue (water) corridors in developments connecting
people to water. This in turn can improve the wellbeing of people that live or work in, or visit or pass
through, the area, as the benefit pathway diagram
below shows. Amenity benefits can be delivered in
new build, retrofit or redevelopment situations
and often relate to the pleasure derived from or

There is growing evidence to suggest that just
being in the presence of green space improves
people's quality of life and health. Those SUDs
based on the creation of green areas, therefore,
have a positive effect on public health and wellbeing.

Grassed swales and water retention ponds

SUDs

TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION

GRAPHIC DETAIL

Swales are shallow, flat bottomed, vegetated open channels designed to convey, treat
and often attenuate surface water runoff. When incorporated into site design, they can
enhance the natural landscape and provide aesthetic and biodiversity benefits. They are
often used to drain roads, paths or car parks, where it is convenient to collect distributed
inflows of runoff, or as a means of conveying runoff on the surface while enhancing
access corridors or other open space. Swales can have a variety of profiles, can be
uniform or non-uniform, and can incorporate a range of different planting strategies,
depending upon the site characteristics and system objectives.
Grassed swales have the capability to reduce runoff volume and improve water quality.
Volume reduction occurs primarily through infiltration into the soil, either as the water
flows over the slide slope perpendicular to the roadway into the swale or down the
length of the swale parallel to the roadway. Pollutant removal can occur by
sedimentation of solid particles onto the soil surface, filtration of solid particles by
vegetation, or infiltration of dissolved pollutants (with stormwater) into the soil (Abida
and Sabourin 2006). When solid particles settle to the soil surface or are captured by
filtration on vegetation, the TSS concentration of the runoff is reduced and overall water
quality is improved as long as the solids do not become resuspended.
Retention ponds are ponds or pools designed with additional storage capacity to
attenuate surface runoff during rainfall events. They consist of a permanent pond area
with landscaped banks and surroundings to provide additional storage capacity during
rainfall events. They are created by using an existing natural depression, by excavating a
new depression, or by constructing embankments.
Retention ponds can provide both storm water attenuation and water quality treatment
by providing additional storage capacity to retain runoff and release this at a controlled

rate. Retention ponds have good capacity to remove urban pollutants and improve the
quality of surface runoff.
Ponds should contain the following zones:


a sediment forebay or other form of upstream pre-treatment system (i.e. as part
of an upstream management train of sustainable drainage components)



a permanent pool which will remain wet throughout the year and is the main
treatment zone



a temporary storage volume for flood attenuation, created through landscaped
banks to the permanent pool



a shallow zone or aquatic bench which is a shallow area along the edge of the
permanent pool to support wetland planting, providing ecology, amenity and
safety benefits.

Water Management

Grassed swales have the capability to reduce
runoff volume and improve water quality.
Pollutants such as total suspended soils (TSS), total
nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) can be
removed in swales through infiltration,
chemisorption, sedimentation and filtration by soil
particles and grassed blades (Stagge et al, 2012).

TSS removal by grassed swale is a physical process and
sedimentation plays a primary role (Fletcher eet al,
2002). Particularly, Deletic and Fletcher (2006)
analyzed the exponential decay of TSS concentration in
grassed swale and found that TSS removal rate
increased with the increasing of hydraulic residence
time. Previous studies showed a great fluctuation of
heavy metals removal by grassed swales. Lead is one of

the most concerning heavy metals in stormwater runoff
and shows the greatest removal by grassed swales,
with event mean concentration (EMC) reductions of 18
– 94 % (Rushton 2001). Zinc, similarly, is one of the most
prevalent heavy metals in stormwater runoff, with EMC
reductions of 75 – 91% (Barret et al., 1998). However,
nutrients, such as nitrogen compounds (NH4 + -N, NO3
- -N) and phosphorus are different from the other
pollutants. Grassed swales have shown wide variability
in removing nutrients, especially for nitrogen (Jia et al
2013). A typical study of grassed swale in Florida have
shown that ammonia-nitrogen (NH4 + -N) could be
effectively removed by grassed swale, conversely,
nitrate-nitrogen (NO3 - -N) is largely suspended in water
with rather low removal rate.

Rain gardens allow stormwater to infiltrate,
recharge aquifers, and reduce park flows. In
addition, they provide water pollutant treatment.

Rain gardens enable a high infiltration of water. The
vast majority (98,8 %) of inflow leaves the rain garden
as subsurface flow. A rain garden with 1 m of native

Rain gardens increase the green areas and create
new little ecosystems. When rain gardens contain
native plants, they provide habitat for beneficial

U/S

Rain gardens represent an important technique of
sustainable drainage, harmonizing the serious
impacts of urbanization and soil sealing.

Every year, heavy rains lead to massive flooding across

Surface water flooding and poor water quality are already
challenges in urban areas, with significant economic costs and
impacts on health and wellbeing, and they are set to intensify
with climate change and increasing urbanisation. Whilst
traditional engineering approaches are part of the solution,
evidence suggests that urban trees can also play a role. This can
be done by preserving woodlands, forests and natural vegetation
in watersheds; enhance urban and suburban tree canopy;
protect trees at development sites; and increase the use of trees
in storm water drainage systems.
It also include the use of tree pits which are adapted hold the
water whilst ensuring good aeration, irrigation and space for the
root system in order that urban trees thrive and provide longterm canopy cover.

can improve safety and community strength.

It was reported by Dandy (2010) that urban trees can
have a ‘safety value,’ with inverse correlations found
between increased greenspace (including tree cover)
and reductions in crime rates and road traffic accidents.
Dandy (2010) notes that one potential explanation for
this is the increased social cohesion associated with
increased use of urban forests.

U

The planting of urban trees can support physical
and mental health and wellbeing. Flooding in
urban areas has a negative impact on mental
wellbeing.

Managing and improving arboreal areas around
urban areas can support local employment.

Controlling for confounding factors, an increase in
urban tree cover is associated with improved mental
health (Willis & Petrokofsky, 2017).

Landscaping improvements in Portland Basin,
Tameside and Winsford, Cheshire yielded respectively
over 16% and 13% net growth in employment (BE
Group, 2014).

Hard drainage-flood prevention – Unearth water courses

Flood actions

TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION

GRAPHIC DETAIL

This NBS focuses on the delivery additional ecological components within
a hard/built engineered approach to water management. They aid the
reduction in pluvial flood risk in urban areas and improve the quality of
water within sewerage systems. The main approaches and benefits of hard
drainage flood prevention are:
Hard drainage flood prevention includes river engineering and dam
construction to control the amount of discharged.
Dams can be built to hold water back and release it in a controlled way.
Water is held in a reservoir behind the dam, and can provide an additional
use, such as hydroelectric power or recreation.
The river channel may be widened or deepened allowing it to carry more
water. A river channel may be straightened so that water can travel faster
along the course. The channel course of the river can also be altered,
diverting floodwaters away from settlements.
Considerations in designing hard drainage flood prevention: The dam
specifications need to consider sediment trapping behind the dam wall,
which can lead to erosion downstream. In addition, altering the river
channel may lead to a greater risk of flooding downstream, as the water is
carried there faster.

Floodable park

Flood Actions

TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION

GRAPHIC DETAIL

Floodable parks can be designed to control flow rates and decrease flow peaks
by storing excess floodwater and releasing it slowly once the risk of flooding has
passed. This type of Natural Based Solutions (NBS) can play a particularly
important role in mitigating potential impacts caused by surface run-off water
from rain, flash-floods or from small and medium sized watercourses. Other
potential benefits that floodable parks can provide are among others, reducing
the water flow entering the public sewerage system together with delivering
amenity and biodiversity benefits.
When planning and designing a floodable park, special consideration must be
taken to the following issues:
Selection and siting of floodable parks
Groundwater levels should be taken in to account to ensure that the basin will
not fill with groundwater, reducing the storage capacity for surface runoff. For
these reasons geotechnical investigations at site are required as well as to
confirm the land stability and underlying soil/geology conditions prior to
construction.
Detention basin design (1)
The storage capacity of the detention basin of the floodable park should be
designed to be appropriate for the contributing catchment area as well as rainfall
characteristics. The size of a detention basin is dependent on several factors such

URBAN GreenUP
GA nº 730426

as topography, the effective contributing area, and the relationship between the
amounts of incoming and discharged water. They can be designed to be any size,
depending on the storage requirements. CIRIA (2007) makes recommendations
as to the design, including:







A maximum depth of not more than 3m.
The basin floor should be made as level and flat as possible to maximise
storage potential and minimise the risk of erosion. This will also reduce
flow velocities within the basin and maximise pollution removal
potential for detention basins (CIRIA, 2007).
Recommended length:width ratio of between 2:1 and 5:1.
Side slopes should not normally be greater than 1 in 4 for reasons of
safety, ease of maintenance and amenity.
Special account should be taken of natural features that could be used
to form the basin and/or provide additional storage areas in order to
minimise the earth-moving tasks and the need for artificial landscaping.

Inlet waterflow control structure design (2)
A spillway or a similar structure must be designed and built in order to keep
under control overflow from rivers, streams or other watercourses. The inlet
waterflow control structure must start diverting flow from river or streams to the
detention basin when the capacity of a watercourse is exceeded and excess
water spills out from the channel onto adjacent urban low-lying areas.
Figure 17 Profile view of an inlet waterflow control structure

Outlet waterflow control structure design (3)
The design of floodable parks must allow to give back the stored water to the
watercourse relatively fast after a flooding episode. The detention basin should
be empty completely in a period of 24-48 hours after the flood event has
occurred. In addition, installing no-return flap valves to avoid downstream water
to return to the detention basin must be considered.

URBAN GreenUP
GA nº 730426

Amenity and planting design (4)
NBS such as floodable parks are relatively high land-take measures. However,
they are well suited to dual purpose use (e.g. open spaces such as public parks),
which can be achieved by taking into account at an early planning and design
stage these recommendations among others (CIRIA, 2007):
 Landscape design and planting should take account local environment
and vegetation. Wherever possible, retain existing habitats and
vegetation and incorporate these into the landscape design.
 Maximise the use of plants that are native and of local provenance,
appropriate to the region and suited to local soils and hydrology.
 Never introduce invasive species.
 Choose species which, when planted together, maximise all-year-round
leaf coverage, flowering and fruiting periods to provide food and shelter
for invertebrates and birds.
Finally, additional floodable park design features should include an emergency
spillway for safe overflow when storage capacity is exceeded, maintenance
access, pedestrian paths throughout the park and an appropriate landscaping
integration.

Description

Vegetation existing in floodable parks contributes
to absorb polluting substances and improve air
quality.
By creating new urban green spaces, floodable
parks may contribute some aesthetic benefit to
the urban landscape and if they are designed
properly, they may help to increase the economic
value of the area.
Floodable parks may be designed by means of
participatory
planning
and
community
involvement.
Floodable parks can be experienced and enjoyed
by greater diversity and number of people from
different socio-economic backgrounds.

Public green spaces contribute to reduce noise
levels, heat islands and air pollution, improving,
consequently, quality of living for the citizens.

Improved cohesion between different socio-economic
backgrounds may be achieved through investments in
NBS across urban areas (Natural England, 2014).
Several studies show that increasing the green areas in
the urban environment has considerable positive
health effects such as reduction in chronic stress and
stress-related diseases (Roe at al., 2013); cognitive and
social development in children (Amoly et al., 2014);
increase of number of people being physically active,
which is directly related to have less likelihood to suffer

TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION

GRAPHIC DETAIL

Green filter is a land application system for treating water (wastewater). It consists of a plot area,
sized according to the influent to be treated, which has forests installed and is irrigated with
wastewater.
The residual water partially evaporates and the rest is taken up by the roots of trees and filtered
through the soil.
Before application to the soil, it is desirable to introduce a primary treatment system, to remove
coarse solids, sand, grease and solids. But these systems provide more than just simple purification,
because while treating the water, we are also producing biomass with high economic value.
Land Application Systems are considered a reliable, robust and low maintenance technology. This,
together with the moderate cost of implementation, makes Land Application Systems a very
competitive technology for treating wastewater from small towns or isolated areas.
Moreover, the production of biomass, either high quality (cycles greater than 10 years) or intensively
(cutting cycles 2 to 3 years), generates a by-product of commercial value that reduces the final
running and maintenance costs. Additionally, the added value generated by the capture of CO2 in
the biomass growth processes may constitute an input to be considered in the case of larger
installations.
Recharging with the treated surplus is another big advantage, which can enable reuse in periods of
great demand.
Finally, the environmental impact caused by this type of treatment is minimal, and in some cases
positive, as it generates a forest ecosystem of great natural and scenic value.

water quality is expected to meet the regulations
related to wastewater treatment/ reuse.

The expected removal rates of the green filter are

treatment

TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION

GRAPHIC DETAIL

Wastewater treatment plant based on the combination of natural treatment systems, such as
constructed wetlands and ponds, following the concept of waterharmonica.
Constructed wetlands are water purification systems that reproduce the processes of
contaminant elimination which occur in natural wetlands. Therefore, constructed wetland
technology operates as a complex ecosystem made of the following elements (Vymazal, 2008;
Kadlec et al., 2009):
>

The water to be treated, which flows through the filtrating substrate and/or vegetation.

>

The substrate, which is the support of the plants and has to retain the microbial
population (in the form of a biofilm), and is essential in most processes aimed at
removing the wastewater contaminants.

>

The emerging aquatic plants (macrophytes), which supply surface area for the formation
of bacterial films; they facilitate the filtration and adsorption of the wastewater
constituents, they help to oxygenate the substrate and remove the nutrients as well as
controlling the growth of algae by limiting the penetration of sunlight. Furthermore, the
vegetation helps to integrate these treatment devices in the landscape.

Traditionally, there are two types of constructed wetland depending on the type of water flow:
surface flow or subsurface flow. In Surface Flow Wetlands, SFW, or Free Water Surface Wetlands,
FWS, the wastewater flows over the substrate whilst in Subsurface Flow Wetlands, SSFW, or
Vegetated Submerged Beds, VSB, the water flows underground through the interstitial spaces of
the filtrating bed.

This NBS is based on the concept of the Waterharmonica, which has been developed by the water boards Hoogheemraadschap Hollands Noorderkwartier (Ruud Kampf) and
Wetterskip Fryslân (Theo Claassen). The Waterharmonica aims for integrated water management, bringing the engineering world of the "Water Chain" and the ecological world
of the "Water System" together. Waterharmonica systems have been constructed in various places in The Netherlands firstly on a small scale but now also on a large scale. At
sites where the Waterharmonica is combined with an ecological connecting corridor it can function as a stepping stone or habitat. The Waterharmonica is very well suited to play
a role in urban water management see for plans in several cities like Apeldoorn Arnhem and Amstelveen (Veluwe 2005, Arcadis 2004 and Leloup Voort et al 2012).
A consequence of the Waterharmonica approach is the creation and restoration of wetlands and the conversion of costs of water purification into economic and natural revenues
for citizens but also for water authority. This applies to an even greater extent to the developing world (Mels Martijn et al 2005). The sensible use of water and nutrients help fight
poverty and simultaneously conserves and enhances important ecosystems. It is not only the solution to a waste water problem; it is especially an area and ecosystem-oriented
approach.

The presence of vegetated areas in combination of
water ponds may reduce locally the heat island
effects.

Values of heat island effect reduction are expected to
be within the range of bibliography reported for similar
GI (reductions between 1.3 and 2.8 ºC have been
reported (Demuzere et al., 2014)).

Organic matter oxidation releases some GHG such
as CO2 and CH4. On the contrary, the presence of
vegetation may reduce the GHG emissions.

The NTWP is addressed to remove the pollutants
(organic matter and nutrients) that are found in
the wastewater. Besides, the treated water may be

areas), after a complementary treatment, thus,
increasing the availability of water resources.

GHG emission from constructed wetlands has been
measured in full-scale constructed wetlands in the last
decade. The CO2 -eq ranges from 660 to 800 mg CO2eq/m2/h depending on the type of CW (Mander et al.,
2014).
The expected removal rates of the NTWP are close the
ones reported for conventional constructed wetlands

Hard drainage pavements

Green
pavements

TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION

GRAPHIC DETAIL

Hard drainage pavements, also known as porous pavements, are nature-based infrastructure which
provides opportunities for increased percolation of rain and surface water through a paved surface. They
are constructed of smaller areas of impermeable surface compared to more traditional paving, which is
interspersed with greased or areas of sand to allow water to dissipate through the surface more quickly.
Hard drainage pavements can also trap suspended solids and thus filter out pollutants associated with
stormwater. The central goal of hard drainage pavements is to control stormwater, reduce runoff and
surface water stagnation and improve water quality in substrate layers via additional filtration. They are
suitable for pedestrian and cycling activity, as well as car parks and other areas of standing water.
Hard drainage pavements can be constructed from a variety of materials whose main property is the
additional filtration of rainfall/stormwater from a surface area to a substrate. The most common forms
of hard drainage pavement are:
1.
2.
3.
4.

Porous concrete
Porous asphalt
Permeable interlocking concrete pavers
Polymer-based grass pavers, grids and geocells

Their construction includes the creation of a series of layers that provide opportunities for rainfall/water
to permeate through the surface to the substrate. This includes the porous top layer (porous
concrete/asphalt or interlocking pavers) which are placed over a rock/stone reservoir or filter layer,
which provides space for water to leach through the different layers. Depending on the location of
intervention there may also be a fabric membrane installed as the bottom layer. The thickness of the
reservoir/filter membrane varies depending on the climatic conditions, with areas of heavily rainfall
requiring a deeper layer to mitigate the additional flow and time needed to dissipate.

In addition, depending on the type of hard drainage system utilised the physical composition of the porous layer will vary. Porous concrete/asphalt and permeable
interlocking concrete pavers will have a uniform look (depending on their design). However, polymer based grass pavers, grids and geocells have a more varied
form (due to the design of different manufacturers), and this can include the use of hexagonal cells which are subsequently filled with natural material, i.e. soils.

Description

Hard drainage pavements increase the level of

quality.

Up to 95% of surface water can be absorbed through
the additional of hard drainage pavement. In addition,
depending upon site conditions it may be possible to
allow the captured water to slowly infiltrate into the
ground or discharge into the next stage of the
management train. The typical flow rate of water
leaving a permeable pavement is 2 to 7 l/s/ha

properties of natural surfaces and vegetation,
reduce the amount of overland flow reaching

Vegetated permanent pavements increase the
green areas and allow water penetrates down
through the voids, feeds the groundwater.

Research by the Construction Industry Research and
Information Association (CIRIA) has shown that a
permeable pavement can remove 60 – 95% of
suspended solids and 70–90% of hydrocarbons. The
result of this is that the water infiltrating into the
ground, or draining into the next stage of the
management train, is significantly higher quality than if
using an impermeable surface coupled to attenuation
tank (Breet Paving – Technical Data Sheet: Permeable

incidence of disturbance to economic activity due
to road closure and inactivity.

The integration of hard drainage pavements can
provide additional economic opportunities for

Green pavements decrease heat absorbed and can

surface temperatures can temporarily offset
warming caused by greenhouse gases.

According to EPA (2012), every 10% increase in solar

4°C. If pavement reflectance throughout a city were
increased from 10 to 35%, the air temperature could
potentially be reduced by 0.6°C.

TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION

GRAPHIC DETAIL

This NBS includes green pavements in a special structure with filter properties and is
appropriated for pedestrians and cyclists. This NBS allows manage the water runoff and
it could be used for cyclist and pedestrian in the cycle-pedestrian areas. This kind of
pavements will serve to reduce cycle speed in specific urban sections with many
pedestrians. Thereby, it will avoid the small flood accumulation surfaces and this water
will can be used to irrigate other NBS (resting areas an pollinator´s modules) in order to
integrate several green infrastructures and several users of them.
Some of the Benefits:
 Water infiltration
 Modular dimensions and freedom to lay patterns (walking routes)
 Suitable for cyclists and pedestrians
 Multiple applications ( sidewalks, street furniture zones, and entire roadways)
 Low maintenance
 Relatively low costs
Previous pavements must be designed to account for the native subsoil infiltration rate.
The depth of the pervious layer, void space, and the infiltration rate of the underlying
soils result in the desired storage volume and intended drain time of the facility.
Selection of pavements, such as permeable pavers, permeable concrete, permeable
asphalt or other materials, should be based on engineering constraints and the
surrounding street context.
Utilize an underdrain system to treat overflow, or if partial infiltration is preferred, to
convey remaining runoff to the municipal sewer system.

Green pavements decrease heat absorbed and can
lower surface temperatures. This decrease in
surface temperatures can temporarily offset
warming caused by greenhouse gases.

According to EPA (2012), every 10% increase in solar
reflectance could decrease surface temperatures by
4°C. If pavement reflectance throughout a city were
increased from 10 to 35%, the air temperature could
potentially be reduced by 0.6°C.

U

Comparing the performance of permeable pavements
to conventional ones, Pratt et al. (1989) found that the
discharge rates from permeable pavements were
significantly lower (30% of peak rainfall rate) and the
time of concentration was greater (5 to 10 minutes,
compared to 2 to 3 minutes for traditional pavements).

Green pavers fit in perfectly with any street scene
and they provide extra benefits when it comes to
spatial effects, drainage and even traffic signalling.

There are solutions available at the market showing
examples with the green pavers establishing a green
street scene, depending on its functionality, without
the need to install separate spacers. (ex. Kellen Green

Rosenfeld et al. (1998) simulated the air quality effects
of deploying cool community strategies (higher albedo
roofs and pavements, increasing tree cover) in Los
Angeles, which resulted in a 12% reduction in smog
exceedance.

U

The greenery ensures that some of the water
evaporates while some of it is absorbed (the
degree of permeability is the decisive factor; stone
chippings can be used as a jointing material).

Water Management

Permeable pavements re-produce the flow

reduce the amount of overland flow reaching
receiving waters, thereby reducing peak flows in
rivers and streams (Pratt et al. 1989, Legret et al.,

Thermal comfort of pedestrians was simulated for a

various strategies including solar reflective cool roofs,
vegetative green roofs, solar reflective cool pavements
and increased street-level trees. Results showed that
greenery integrated caused significant reductions in
surface air temperatures and small changes in mean
radiant temperature during the day (Taleghani et al.,
2016).

U

Related to the Air Quality, thanks to the reduction
of the pollutants, the public health and well-being
can be positively affected.

Dowling (2014) reported that in Melbourne-Australia
appr. 200 heat-related deaths recorded in 2013, in
comparison to the state road toll of 242 deaths. By
2030, the number of deaths as a result of heat is
expected to double.

U

Every 1°C temperature reduction that can be
achieved through the better design of cities can
equate to 5% energy saving through reduced
cooling.

AECOM (2015) published a report on the impacts of
heat, heat waves and the intensification of the urban
heat island effect on health, transport infrastructure,
energy demand and infrastructure, trees and animals
and crime. The report concluded that “The total
economic cost to community due to hot weather is
estimated to be $1.8 billion in present value terms.
Approximately one-third of these impacts are due to
heatwaves. Of the total heat impact, the urban heat
island effect contributes appr. $300 million in present
value”.

By adding the greenery into the urban space, the
climate mitigation, water management, air quality
increase, as an effect the urban regeneration is
positively affected, more comfortable and
enjoyable urban spaces.

Green pavers material production creates a new
economic sector and job opportunities.

Another study claims that a 1°C temperature increase
boosts cooling loads by 1.5 million kWh/year,

TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION

GRAPHIC DETAIL

In many cities, pavements (roads, platforms, pavement around buildings, parking areas,
etc.) represent the largest percentage of a community’s land cover (30-40%),
compared with roof and vegetated surfaces (Akbari et al., 1999;
Akbari and Rose, 2008).
Cool pavements are reflective/permeable pavements that help lower surface
temperatures and reduce the amount of heat absorbed into the pavement.
Solar reflective "cool" pavements stay cooler in the sun than conventional pavements.
Pavement reflectance can be enhanced by using reflective aggregate, reflective or clear
binder or reflective surface coating.
Permeable pavements—which allow air, water, and water vapour into the voids of a
pavement, keeping the material cool when moist.
Cool pavements may include:
1. Conventional asphalt pavements, which consist of an asphalt binder mixed with
aggregate, can be modified with high solar reflectance (SR) materials or treated after
installation to raise reflectance.
2. Conventional concrete pavements (due to the grey colour they reflect sun light).
3. Other reflective pavements, made from a variety of materials, are mostly used for
low-traffic areas, such as side-walks, trails, and parking lots. Examples include: Resin

based pavements, which use clear tree resins in place of petroleum-based elements to
bind an aggregate coloured asphalt and coloured concrete, with added pigments or
seals to increase reflectance.
4. Non-vegetated permeable pavements contain voids and are designed to allow water
to drain through the surface into the sub-layers and ground below. These materials can
have the same structural integrity as conventional pavements. Examples include
porous asphalt or open graded friction course asphalt pavements (they improve road
friction in wet weather), and rubberized asphalt (also reduce noise), pervious concrete,
brick or concrete pavement blocks,
5. Vegetated permeable pavements use plastic, metal or concrete lattices to support
and allow grass or other vegetation grow in the lattices. They are suitable in areas with
low traffic flow (Subramanian, 2014).

thermochemical conversion in an oxygen limited environment.
Quality, and especially toxicants, are problematic in biochar, so a number of
certification schemes have been developed. For example, the European Biochar
certification and the International Biochar Initiative (IBI) have created
certification program to ensure biochar meets certain minimum standards. The
quality of biochar is measured in these schemes by considering organic carbon
levels, ash content, and biomass.
Such schemes also consider the whole product lifecycle, such as carbon stability,
metal contamination levels, economic viability, and sustainable provision of
feedstock.

Smart Soil holds the key not only to improving agricultural productivity, but also
making significant contributions to climate mitigation. In climate-smart urban
farming precinct there will be smart soil production area targeting dense urban
areas, poor with soil and leftover spaces near built residential district.
In this study, the construction of a strategic pathway to utilize pyrolysis

feasible utilization techniques.
Smart soil produced in climate-smart urban farming precinct will also be used in
Zoo green car park area enriching the capacity of green shady structures.
Biochar sequestration:
So given a certain amount of carbon that cycles annually through plants, half of
it can be taken out of its natural cycle and sequestered in a much slower biochar
cycle (see graphic). By withdrawing organic carbon from the cycle of
photosynthesis and decomposition biochar.
The biomass is converted into biochar and because of its stability sequesters all
but 5 percent of the carbon (in this illustration) in the soil and hence has the

Smart soils elaboration has a twofold purpose, on the one hand the used waste
is valued, minimizing the potential environmental impacts derived from poor
management of them and, on the other hand, degraded soils are recovered
without excessive costs.
Components of the mixtures have different and individual characteristics,
according to the final destination of the smart soil elaborated: depending on
their fertilizing, structuring and water properties.
Smart soils derived from non-hazardous waste must comply the main functions
of the soils, be susceptible to evolve by soil formation processes and realize an
efficient stabilization of the carbon in the soil and in the biomass.
Smart soils are used in recovery processes of degraded and / or contaminated
soils and water, areas with rocky outcrops, covering of tailings, areas affected by
urban works and urban / peri-urban infrastructures (such as roundabouts,
roadsides and non-recreational garden areas), industrialized areas, mines and
quarries or silvicultural soils degraded by erosion, fire or loss of productive
capacity, intensive forestry soils and non-food biomass crops.
Smart soils may be are made from residues coming from agrifood sludge and
biomass residues coming from different types of pruning (urban and non-urban)
and other waste.
Specific bacteria can be added to the technosols so that they are released
gradually. These bacteria are achieved by the Technosols be able to actively

Management

Pollinator walls provide much-needed food and
habitat for pollinator species, enhancing
biodiversity of both plant and animal species.

There is anecdotal evidence that living walls can
increase the presence of pollinators, but more robust
quantification is needed (Francis and Lorimer 2011;
Whittinghill and Rowe 2012). In general, vertical walls
are currently thought to be limited in terms of
biodiversity provision, but more research is needed to
understand their ecological contributions (Enzi et al.
2017).

Climate change
mitigation &
adaptation

Green façades reduce the heat island effect. They
increase the thermal insulation in the building and
therefore reduce the use of energy in air
conditioning and heating. Green façades protect
buildings from the precipitation and the sun,
improving indoor climate.

Hydroponic green façade can reduce the interior
temperature of a building to 5ºC in summer, as well as
keep it in winter. (H. Akira, 2010). Green façades help
reduce energy costs in buildings by 0,71-19 €/m2 (de
Roo, 2011).

B

Green noise barriers are natural air-filters, creating
a cleaner environment. The vegetation
metabolizes harmful toxins while releasing oxygen.

U/S

Urban Regeneration

Green façades increase the economic value and
the lifespan of buildings. Green façades add colour,
texture and interest to the urban landscape.

Studies have shown that having plants around a
building can increase real estate values by up to 20%
(Green Over Grey). The installation of green façades can
earn buildings LEED points, and if the building reaches
LEED certification, can receive tax credits between
€6,5-57 /m2 (Ambius).

Management

Pollinator green roofs provide foraging
opportunities for urban wildlife, representing

This NBS is designed to reduce the traffic noise that arrives at the homes on the
street. On the one hand, the green noise barriers have a specific geometry that
favors sound reflection and on the other hand, they have a vertical garden
modules with a specific substrate that favors sound absorption.

Structure. Metallic structure with a specific geometry that allows the
reflection of the noise. This structure is affixed to the pavement. (4)
Metallic piece affixed to the structure that fastens the vertical garden

rock wool substrate is adhered. (3)
Irrigation system. Drip irrigation pipes that soak the substrate. (2)
Vegetation. The vegetation are plants with little nutrient and water
needs. They are species resistant to local climate suitable for growing
in an inert substrate such as rock wool. (1)
Water collection system. All the water from the irrigation system is
collected on the bottom of the garden. (6)

The dimensions of this NBS depend on the geometry of the structure (straight,
curved or both) the height of residential buildings and the width of the street.

The green sound barriers manage to introduce
large vegetable surfaces without occupying large
urban spaces.

About 3 to 10 m2 of plant vertical surface can be
installed on 0.5 m2. With this numbers we can calculate
that this NBS gets about 6 to 20 m2 of green surface for
each square meter of urban land.

Green noise barriers are natural air-filters, creating
a cleaner environment. The vegetation
metabolizes
harmful toxins while releasing
oxygen.

1 m2 of vegetation cover generates the oxygen required

Installing vegetable surfaces in the city brings new
aesthetic values and revalues the neighborhoods
where these NBS are located.

Studies have shown that having plants around a
building can increase real estate values by up to 20%

Green Façade with climbing plants

Vertical GI

TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION

GRAPHIC DETAIL

A green façade is a wall completely or partially covered with greenery. A green
façade with climbing plants uses a trellis system to hold the vines of plants that
are rooted in the ground or containers. Green façades offer economic,
environmental, aesthetic and physiological benefits to the urban environment.
Unlike green panels that can be integrated into the building only if engineered to
hold the weight (80-100 kg/m3), this type of green façades can be planted in the
ground/container and using a trellis system they can be attached to any building
or structure.
This green façade is built with:





A soil container. (1)
Soil mixture of 30% sand, 30% compost and 40% topsoil. (2)
A trellis system. (3)

Wisteria sp. and Vitis sp.) (4)
Air gap between the building and the trellis system (optional). (5)

Green façades reduce the heat island effect. They
increase the thermal insulation in the building and
therefore reduce the use of energy in air
conditioning and heating. Green façades protect
buildings from the precipitation and the sun,
improving indoor climate.

Green façades help reduce energy costs in buildings by
0,71-19 €/m2 (de Roo, 2011). Green façades can reduce
wall surfaces temperatures by as much as 10º C
(Ambius).

Water Management

Green façades naturally absorb and filter
stormwater, and have high rates of
evapotranspiration, which contributes to a normal
water cycle. Green façade’s roots and
microorganisms remove water pollutants.

A simulated study showed greenwalls retained
comparably favourable amounts of stormwater (when
compared to bare walls), contributing to stormwater
mitigation (Kew et al., 2014).

U

Green façades represent valuable compensatory
habitats for insects and birds.

According to a study in the UK, birds exploited green
walls and façades for nesting, food and shelter, but
were never found on bare control walls. 137 species of
insects were also found in green walls and façades
(Chiquet et al., 2012).

Floating gardens

Horizontal GI

TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION

GRAPHIC DETAIL

Floating gardens can take many forms including pontoons, floating platforms
and barges. They can vary in size from small individual platforms to longer
pontoon systems as seen on the River Seine (Paris) and the Chicago river
(Chicago). In urban areas they can be placed on non-tidal water bodies such as
dock systems, lakes, canals and ponds as tidal areas may damage the gardens
structure.
Some are constructed from a plant material floating sub-layer such as water
hyacinths and then have planted flora, fauna or food products growing on top.
Others use materials with a natural buoyancy, i.e. plastics or woods, as the sublayer. Floating gardens provide habitats for varied marine/terrestrial species,
opportunities for urban agriculture and climate change mitigation. They can
also act as connective features linking habitats across urban boundaries
(dependent on size/location and species mix).
The strength and extent of the floating garden depend on the construction of
the raft and the weight of the material placed/grown on it.

To ensure that the floating garden is structurally sound (and flexible to
development contexts) the following issues surrounding their engineering
should be taken into consideration:





Marine-grade engineering to withstand all weather conditions
Locking stainless steel quick connect system, making it easy to add

Fully cross-braced structure for added strength
UV resistant thermo-fused tough floats
Concrete anchors secured using weighted guide rail

Floating gardens provide benefits for water quality and air pollution/climate
change mitigation. They also act as a key additional habitat for a diverse range
of water based, insect and bird species within urban areas.

Floating gardens provide an additional set of green
spaces that can utilise otherwise redundant
spaces. They can provide recreational, sociocultural, and ecological benefits in terms of
environmental education, the provision of spaces
for interaction, and additional water/terrestrial
habitats in high-density urban areas.

U/S

Due to the increased proportion of NBS/GI being
developing in urban areas floating gardens have
the potential to increase the level of pollution
being taken out of the atmosphere. This depends
on the specific flora/fauna mix of each floating
garden.

1 m2 of vegetation cover generates the oxygen required
by a person throughout the year. (Darlington, 2001)
1 m2 of plant cover traps 130 grams of dust per year.
(Darlington, 2001)

Investment in high quality floating gardens can be
associated with property uplift in urban areas (i.e.
Liverpool, Paris and London). They can also
promote increased tourism and spend when they
are located in sites with high footfall and an
attractive amenity offer.

The provision of pontoons/platforms on the Chicago
River (Chicago), River Seine (Paris), and in the Little
Venice area of London have shown that investment in
NBS can lead to economic uplift in property, increased
use and spend in an area, and further inward

Electrowetland

Horizontal GI

TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION

GRAPHIC DETAIL

An Electrowetland is a natural wastewater treatment system that generates
electricity from the oxidation of the organic matter. It is based on a
conventional Horizontal Subsurface Flow Constructed Wetland (HSSF CW) in
which electrodes are introduced. Therefore, it consists on a planted and
permanently flooded gravel basin in which wastewater flows horizontally from
one side to the other of the system crossing the electrode layer. Electrodes
implementation and the electrical connection stablished through them
stimulate the development of an exoelectrogenic biofilm able to transfer the
electrons resulting from the degradation of the organic matter to an external
circuit thus generating electricity. Wastewater treatment efficiency is also
improved resulting in lower wetland surface requirements when compared to
conventional wetlands. To date, very few Electrowetland pilot-scale
experiences have been reported and therefore, the design specifications
stablished in this document constitute a proposal based on the conclusions
obtained in the lab-scale experiments already published.
Conventional HSSF CWs – design parameters (Ortega, Ferrer, Salas, Aragón, & Real,
2010)

 Range of application: <2000 he
 Surface requirement (aprox.): 5m2/p.e.
 Total bed depth: 0.4-0.6 m
 Organic loading: 8.7 g BOD/m2·d

Electrowetlands are built with the following materials:
(1) Liner: implemented at the bottom of the treatment bed in order to prevent untreated wastewater percolation into subsurface water bodies. The material
selected must be impermeable and resistant to root penetration.
(2) Coarse gravel: placed at the inlet/outlet regions in order to distribute wastewater through wetland section and to guarantee a good wetland’s drainage,
respectively.(Kadlec, & Wallace, 2009)
(3) Non-conductive filter bed: made with gravel of a grain-size distribution of about 8-16 mm. (Kadlec et al., 2000)
(4) Anodic electrode: vertical layer made with a conductive and biocompatible filtering material in which the electrons resulting from the oxidation will be
generated and transferred to the external circuit. (Corbella, 2017)
(5) Cathodic electrode: horizontal layer made of a conductive granular material that is placed at the wetland’s surface and where electrons coming from the
external circuit will be used to reduce atmospheric oxygen. This layer must be, at least, 10 cm height in order to ensure its constant contact with the water
table regardless water level variations within the system. (Corbella, 2017)
(6) Electron collector layers: made of a mesh conductive material and placed in the middle of the conductive anodic and cathodic filter beds. They serve to collect
and release the electrons.
(7) External circuit: electrical circuit that connects the anodic and the cathodic granular electrodes collecting the electricity generated.
(8) Energy harvesting and sensoring system: Electronic devices to harvest the energy produced and to use it to power low-consuming sensors of temperature
and relative humidity.
(9) Vegetation: aquatic vegetation is planted all through the wetlands’ surface. Soft tissue emergent, including Phragmites, Typha, and Schoenoplectus (Scirpus)
are the most common species used. (Kadlec, & Wallace, 2009)

phosphorus from wastewater by means of

Wetlands (HSSF CWs) (90-95% for suspended solids;
85-90% for BOD5; 80-90% for COD; 20-30 Ntotal; 20-30
Ptotal (Ortega, Ferrer, Salas, Aragón, & Real, 2010)) are
expected for the Electrowetland.

Electrowetland increases the green areas that can
act as drivers for sustainable development.
However due to the presence of wastewater in the
systems, it is not accessible to citizens.

Beyond wastewater treatment, constructed wetlands
constitute urban biodiversity hotspots in which aquatic
fauna and flora can grow thus preserving and
enhancing biodiversity. ( Martis, Mulas, Malavasi, &
Marignani, 2016)

The relative contribution to CH4 and N2O emissions
from a treatment system will depend on the
environmental conditions. The fluxes of N2O–N, CH4–
C, and CO2–C from Constructed Wetlands in Europe
ranged from 22.1 to 1000, 232 to 38000, and 2840 to
93000 mg m-2 d-1, respectively (Søvik et al.,2006).
However, as function of its lifespan, CWs constitute a
carbon source or a carbon sink. (Brix, Sorrell &
Lorenzen, 2001)

U

Plants present in the Electrowetland are CO2
consumers. However, certain amounts of
greenhouse gases are emitted while wastewater is
treated as a consequence of oxidation of the
organic
matter
(CO2,
CH4)
or
the
nitrification/denitrification process (N2O).

Due to its capacity to generate electricity from the
oxidation of the organic matter, Electrowetlands
can result in energy savings. However, only low
input devices, such as sensors, could be powered.
Although HSSF CWs are linked to low operation
and maintenance costs some process monitoring
and cleaning tasks are required. Construction
phase also results in job creation both for qualified
and unqualified personnel.

Maximum power of 44 mW/m2 of wetland surface has
been reported from lab-scale Electrowetlands.
(Doherty, et al., 2015)

13 different maintenance activities have to be
conducted including cleaning tasks, wastewater
analysis, operation control and plants trim.
Accordingly, a worker time of about 160 h/year is
required. (Ortega, Ferrer, Salas, Aragón, & Real, 2010)

Green filter area

Pollutants
filter

TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION

GRAPHIC DETAIL

Green filter areas are vertical green infrastructure interventions, constructed to provide a
visual barrier and/or and pollution filter between roads or industrial operations and public
space or walkways. Green filter areas may take the form of street trees, green walls (screens),
shrubs or hedges. Trees, shrubs or climbers may be planted directly into the ground or into
containers. Green filter planting may be combined with solid barrier construction to reduce
noise impact.
Choice of plant species and urban layout is important in designing vertical vegetation
interventions for air pollution mitigation. Higher rates of particulate capture are associated
with the complex shoot structure and finer leaves of conifer species (Beckett et al. 2000;
Freer-Smith et al. 2005). Whilst trees and shrubs can remove gaseous pollutants from the
atmosphere and provide large surface areas for deposition of particulate pollutants, careful
design of the vertical green filter area, accounting for local conditions, is required to avoid
exacerbation of local pollutant concentrations through reducing airflow and slowing dispersal.
Increased height (over 5m) and width (10m) will in general increase the effectiveness of green
filter areas in reducing concentrations of airborne pollutants (Baldauf, 2016). Both density (to
allow maximum deposition) and porosity (to allow penetration rather than deflection of
airflow) of low vegetation barriers close to pollution source are important for effective
capture of particulate pollutants (Janhäll, 2015). Gaps in green vegetation barriers can result
in increased downwind ambient pollution concentrations (Baldauf, 2016).
Design and maintenance considerations include: avoiding obstruction of driver and
pedestrian lines of site and access; irrigation during drought; pruning annual growth; and
removal and replacement of dead vegetation; Choice of woody vegetation should take into

barrier; and avoidance of poisonous, invasive or allergenic species, or species associated with
pollutant emissions (including VOCs) (Baldauf, 2016).

Green filter areas contribute to the effect of urban
vegetation in reducing the urban heat island effect
and to the sequestration of carbon by vegetation.

The trees and shrub species which constitute green
filter areas contribute to the general effect of urban
vegetation in reducing the urban heat island effect
through evaporative cooling, and to the sequestration
of carbon by vegetation.

S

Water Management

Where green filter vegetation is rooted in
permeable substrate at ground level, surface water
run-off may be absorbed; reducing demand on
urban drainage systems during periods of high
precipitation.

Roadside green filter areas can be constructed to
control surface water run-off from impermeable
pavement or road surfaces, mitigating local surface
water flooding and pollution (Baldauf, 2016). Tree and
shrub canopies intercept rainfall, reducing the speed at
which rainfall enters the drainage system (Dover,
2015).

S

Green filter interventions can be retro-fitted into
areas of dense urban infrastructure, increasing
available habitat for birds and insects, and
providing linear features connecting existing areas
of urban greenspace.

Studies of urban biodiversity show that highly-mobile
taxa, including pollinators, will use patches of urban
green space separated by dense infrastructure, and
that flowering plants in urban areas can attract a
diverse range of pollinator species (Hennig and Ghazoul
2012, Baldock et al. 2015). Design considerations for
green filter interventions include avoiding providing
connectivity for invasive species through the urban
environment (Baldauf, 2016).

The woody shrubs and/or trees which constitute
green filter areas have the capacity to reduce
concentrations of airborne gaseous and particulate
pollution, improving environmental conditions
impacting public health.

Through increasing the surface area available for
particulate deposition and by increasing the length of
the pathway for dispersal of pollutants, vertical green
filter areas may reduce concentrations of airborne
pollutants in adjacent pedestrian areas (Ferranti et al.
2017). Particulates deposited on leaf surfaces include
trace heavy metals originating from road transport
vehicles, including lead, cadmium, copper, zinc, iron
and manganese (Aničić et al. 2011; Ugolini et al. 2013;

GRAPHIC DETAIL

This NBS uses a special substrate (mixture of urban by –products) as
filter media to capture pollutants (NOx, PM, CO, benzene, toluene,
etc.) form the air of underground parking without waste generation.
This NBS uses a rhizodegradation process in which contaminants are
degraded in the rhizosphere (area of soil surrounding the roots of
the plants) by means of microbial activity which is enhanced by the
presence of plant roots. That takes place in soil to the process.
Some of the Benefits:




Reduction of gaseous contaminants and CO2 concentration
at the outflow position
Balance of the flow, temperature, humidity and
contaminants concentration
Depending on implementation design it adds aesthetics
values to the urban street.

In the biofilter the contaminated air is introduced in the plenum
chamber by a side inlet pipe. The air is injected through the pipe and
there are no additional physical distributors within the plenum
chamber volume to control the air flow once it enters the chamber.
The principal advantage of this design concept is its relative
simplicity and ease of construction.

Green Space
Management

Parklets are a form of green space in a micro
scale. They provide seating, greenery and space
to passers-by. Depends on their design some
parklets may cover air purifying plants and
pollinator houses that serve as green buffers for
hosting biodiversity.

Based on some studies by experts, it will suppose
that parklets may cover approximately 35 sqm more
of green areas, 30 sqm of shadow areas and 20.8 ton
CO2 avoided per annum (Strohbach et. al, 2012).
Littke’s study (2016) on parklets of San Francisco
reveals that only 5 to 10 percent of parklet surface is
devoted to green area.

U/S

Parklets may increase property values and drive
up revenues for nearby businesses. A parklet
opposite a shop or cafe has proved a useful way
of getting passers-by to slow down and stop in,
making them a potential tool in regeneration,
especially for local shopping streets. Parklets can
be a part of solution for a city’s need for more
public space in its commercial corridors. They
transform underutilized street space into
vibrant public space. It can also be produced by
retrofitted materials.

There are no scholarly proven examples of increase
in property values near parklet locations. However,
many impact study reports suggest that local
business near parklets benefited from this street
regeneration process. From the business
perspective, there was not any negative impacts

number of bikes parked in observed parklet
locations. The same study also confirmed that
pedestrian traffic was only marginally increased

TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION

GRAPHIC DETAIL

Green resting areas are green spaces projected for social passive recreation
(resting, relaxation, observing nature, social contact). The development of green
resting areas plays a central role in policies related to health, nature conservation
and spatial planning.
Green resting areas are built with:
 Native soil. (1)
 Compacted soil mixture of 20-30% sand, 20-30% compost and 30-40%
topsoil. (2)
 Draining gravel layer. This layer all allows excess water to be infiltrated.
(3)
 Vegetation - Tree. The selection of species depends on the climate, the
depth and the composition of the substrate, if we put an irrigation
system… (4)
 Vegetation – Shrubs. The selection of species depends on the climate,

Experience / Study

Green resting areas reduce the heat island effect.

Green resting areas decrease impervious surfaces,
and provide water retention possibilities on site,
increasing recharge of aquifers and reducing peak
runoff problems.

Green resting areas implemented near the coast
increase the ability of the landscape to return to its
original form after hazardous events such as
hurricanes, coastal storms and flooding.

Green resting areas contribute to soil formation,
nutrient cycling, trophic-dynamic regulation of
faunistic populations, and offers habitat for
resident and transient species.

An increase of tree cover by 10% results in a
temperature decrease of 1,4 ºC (Tyrvainen et al., 2005).
The thermoregulation capacity of an average tree in a
“hotspot” in the city has a benefit of 30 €/year (de Roo,
2011).
Studies show that in green spaces only 10% of
rainwater will experience superficial runoff (50% will be
infiltrated in soil and 25% will return to atmosphere
through evapotranspiration), which contributes for the
regulation of hydrological flows (Bernatzky, 1983).
The capacitance, damping and integrity of ecosystem
response to coastal environmental fluctuations depend
on the total area of green infrastructure solutions (The
Nature Conservancy).

Boston has developed a plan to prevent flooding in its
most vulnerable waterfront neighbourhoods by
projecting elevated green areas (Gibson, 2017).
Studies have showed biodiversity is the precondition
for ecosystem services in urban areas (de Groot et al.,
2002). Studies have concluded some conditions to
increase biodiversity in green resting areas are:
dimension of the green space, plant diversity, presence
of herbaceous borders and water sources, presence of
pollen and nectar-rich species, fruit trees and
rocks/gravel for insect resting (Tyrvainen et al., 2005;
Hoffman, 2011; de Roo, 2011).

Scale

There has been a growing spread of “outdoor living
laboratories” in green resting areas (American Society
of Landscape Architects).

Air Quality

Plants in green resting areas are able to remove air
pollutants, urban smog (atmosphere suspended
particles) and intercept ultraviolet radiation.
Through photosynthesis, plants are able to
sequester carbon dioxide and release oxygen,
maintaining a beneficial atmospheric composition
for human life.

Green resting areas increase the economic value of
the buildings.

Urban Regeneration

An interconnected network of green spaces adds
form to urban patterns, creating points of interest
and harmonizing negative effects arising from
urban expansion and habitat fragmentation.
The increase of green resting areas creates
aesthetically pleasant places in urban context.

Participatory Planning
and Governance

Green resting areas represent an opportunity for
participatory
planning
and
community
involvement.

Trees present in big scale urban green spaces can filter
up to 85% of atmospheric pollution, while some aligned
trees can filter up to 70% (Bernatzky, 1983). An average
tree in the city is able to capture about 100 g particulate
matter (PM10), which equals the particulate matter
emission from a private car that travels 1500 km
(Tonneikck, 2008).

U

A single mature tree can absorb carbon dioxide at a rate
of 22 kg/year and release enough oxygen back into the
atmosphere to support 2 human beings (McAliney,
1993).

Houses with a view of green are 1-15% more valuable.
Offices with green spaces nearby can be 10% more
valuable (de Roo, 2011).
In New York, cost-benefit analysis has shown that every
dollar invested in green space delivers 5 back for the
city (Long, 2012).
Participatory planning and community involvement
have been increasingly adopted in the project of green
resting areas. One example is the project of green
resting areas in High Point (Seattle), which involved

Potential of economic

Greener environments encourage people to spend
more time in outdoor spaces, increasing the rates
of social interaction and cohesion.

Green resting areas offer diverse conditions for
amenity purposes (recreation, relaxing, observing
nature), having several positive impacts in human
health and well-being.

Green resting areas create maintenance jobs.
Green resting areas improve the overall ecologic
and aesthetic quality of urban environment,
attracting visitors and tourists.

Studies have shown green resting areas increase social
cohesion, building a solid community sense (de Roo,
2011). Studies in the Netherlands have concluded that
the quantity and quality of greenery in a
neighbourhood is associated with its social cohesion
(de Vries et al., 2013).

U/S

Recent studies concluded the presence of green
resting areas in neighbourhoods reduces adolescent’s
aggressive behaviour (Journal of the American
Academy of Adolescent Psychiatry).
Studies have demonstrated that users of green resting
areas live longer (Takano et al., 2012), have reduced
cardiovascular diseases (Michel & Popham, 2008),
enhanced physical activity, reduced obesity, reduced
risk of allergies and asthma and improved functioning
of the immune system (Godbey, 2009). These users also
have improved mental health and cognitive function
(Pretty et al., 2005).

In Philadelphia, urban green spaces are calculated to
yield annually direct savings of $1.1 billion annually,
and contributions of $40 million in revenue attracting
tourism (Long, 2012).

Climate-smart greenhouses

Urban farming

GRAPHIC DETAIL

TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION
Climate-smart greenhouse can be defined as an approach for transforming
and reorienting agricultural development under the new realities of climate
change. Climate smart soil and agriculture will be practice in a greenhouse and
on field together.
Critical agricultural production will be produced under changed climate
condition in future. Considering these condition, most of the critical
agricultural products will be produce in greenhouses instead of using fields.
Therefore, the greenhouses must have some spatial construction that use less
energy that produced by dam or other sources. Because water in reservoirs
will be used for drinking and if possible for irrigation. We need to hold water
in greenhouses as liquid or gas formed. For this proposes spatial roof design
will be planned for reuse water from gas to liquid forms.

Figure 53 Example for a smart greenhouse

Green houses will be including several sections inside. One part of them will
be used for illuminating desertification and soil degradation. Another part will
use for plants productions.
The area in the greenhouse needs to be used effectively for agricultural
production. We will design spatial platforms for horizontal plantation. One of
them is a stabile horizontal platform that has seven or eight seeding shelves.
The other horizontal platform will be design as several shelves that can be
vertically revolving to gain sunlight equally. Agricultural production will be
done as hydroponic method (Figure 55).

Water demand of greenhouses will be obtained from portable distiller to
desalinize saline water to fresh water.
Sunlight will use main energy sources for heating and also for lightening.
Energy will be produce from both photovoltaic battery and parabolic concave
collectors.
Two greenhouses each with 1,000 m2 area will be built to illustrate the effects
of climate change on urban and rural green vegetation. The greenhouses also
will be use to demonstrate producing agricultural crop continuously under
changed climate condition.
Urban farming/community practices/new social forms of organization will be
demonstrated in the climate-smart urban farming precinct in the special
project area.
This NBS employs Greenhouses facilities to illustrate the effects of climate
change on urban green vegetation used in urban green areas and farming (for
both urban and periurban areas). This practice will help to select adequate
vegetal species for Urban farming and to establish community practices and
new social forms of organization.

High velocity evaporation accelerates movement of salty ground water to soil
surface. Field crops production and horticulture will be limited due to
salinization and alkalization of soils. Producing some agricultural crops will be
demonstrated on salty soils using spatial field design. Dibbling process will be
done on high ridge (around 70 cm from soil surface level). The ridges will be
placed on a pebbly layer with a thickness of 20 cm for disturbing capillarity
and prevent from salty ground water (Fig.56).

This water could be reused for irrigation proposes. The plots can be delimited
with bricks, wood or not and other kind of small and natural fences; and filled
with compost, peat, topsoil. The exploitation of these agricultural surfaces can
be carried out by families with shortage of resources, neighbourhood
associations, unemployed or retired people, which will have technical support
from the very beginning from agronomical specialist (it takes part of the
educational activities of the urban orchard). It is considered a social/community
space where people and families can obtain profit from nature (healthy
vegetables cultivated by themselves with traditional techniques, enjoy the calm
and beauty of green and natural areas improving their wellbeing, etc.)
Different plants grow in these plots: Vegetables for food, companion planting as
natural pest controller and attract pollinators, fruit trees, etc.
This kind of urban agricultural activities can include sustainable energy systems
as the combination with solar panels to the pump for irrigation system.

TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION

GRAPHIC DETAIL

In order to develop an optimal composting process, it is very important
that the raw materials are suitable for composting and there should have
a correct proportion in the mixture of different structures and type of
fibres, size of particles, adequate percentage of water, natural ferments,
etc. In addition, the volume and aeration are decisive parameters for the
correct formation of the compost.
The minimum volume should be a 1m2. The dimensions of the composter
should be of minimum 50 cm and maximum 150 cm for side, and a
maximum height of 160 cm. The pH must be maintained between 6 and
7; and the temperature also should be maintained between 35 and 65 ºC.
The composting time depends on many factors and it can take from 1 to
6 months.

This section reviews the academic literature to understand the state of the current evidence for
the use of nature based solutions, how they fit with other types of urban interventions, and how
they fit within existing political landscapes and policy debates.

4.1 Nature vs. technological investment vs. grey/built infrastructure
One of the key debates regarding the use of NBS is its focus. Should NBS mimic or represent only
natural systems and practices or is there scope to integrate a more technological approach to
their use in practice? Moreover, questions arise focussing on where NBS should be situated in
the range of environment and landscape practices currently being used to shape urban
development (e.g. GI, ecosystem services, biomimicry, hard and soft engineering practices), and
how this influences the choices being made by built environment specialists (Pontee et al.,
2016). This is a crucial debate for NBS, as Nesshöver et al. (2016) promote NBS as a direct
challenge to existing grey infrastructure practices and argue that NBS are needed to promote a
transition to a more socio-economic and ecological approach to urban management; Liquete et
al. (2016) consider NBS as a companion and not a replacement for engineered solutions.
A key aspect of the debates supporting NBS has been the subtle shift in emphasis that places
‘nature’ at the centre of development debates. This has extended the discussions of humanenvironmental interactions inherent in green infrastructure planning, a major departure from
the broader policy/practice evaluations proposed in the more generic ‘green space’ literature
(Albert & Von Haaren, 2014; Hansen & Pauleit, 2014). The NBS literature concentrates on the
inclusion of ‘nature’ in its widest sense in all development, and promotes the ecological value of
NBS as of equal importance to socio-cultural and economic benefits (Kabisch et al., 2016). This
has shifted the framing of landscape planning as although green infrastructure was the most
recent (and widely accepted) articulation of green/landscape debates it emphasised the broader
links between people, place, policy and the landscape, and not a primary nature-centric form of
investment (Mell, 2016; Eggermont et al., 2015; Hansen & Pauleit, 2014). Green infrastructure
planning therefore promotes a human-environmental paradigm for urban development that
locates nature within the broader discussion of development (Austin, 2014). NBS differs from
this approach as it attempts to moves development forward positioning ‘nature’ as the central
aspect of urban growth. This does not necessarily undermine the need to consider the social and
economic benefits of non-NBS but actively promotes nature as a key development principle.
Moreover, within the literature NBS they debate the ecological focus that development should
take extending the rationale for the use of the key principles proposed in green infrastructure
planning, namely connectivity, accessibility and multi-functionality (Kabisch et al., 2016; Sinnett,
Smith, & Burgess, 2015).

Although the principles of green space planning, greenways, ecosystem services and green
infrastructure remain central to the promotion of NBS, they do not form the central tenants of
its use (Cohen-Shacham et al., 2016). This can be considered as a significant departure from the
literature but provides opportunities for a broader acceptance of ecologically focussed planning
in Europe, as concepts such as green infrastructure are not universally used. For example,
Germany has retained its use of “green space planning” terminology in many regions despite
the ubiquity of green infrastructure in planning discussions (Kabisch & Haase, 2014; Mell et al.,
2017); whilst in Italy urban woodlands/forestry is a more prominent form of landscape
investment (Gasparella et al., 2017; Sanesi et al., 2017). However, in locations where green
space planning dominate, such as in Germany, the proposal for nature to be the central
characteristic of development may be accepted, as it maps more effectively onto existing green
space practices. Therefore, despite the perceived need to reconsider or at least align the
terminology used to support NBS there is scope to align the key principles of existing green space
planning practices with the definitions of NBS proposed in the literature. The EKLIPSE framework
(Raymond et al., 2017) and the wider pan-European Horizon 2020 portfolio may therefore act
as a litmus test to assess whether NBS can be considered as being universally accepted.
A key aspect of this process is the presentation of NBS as a complementary rather than
transformative approach to urban development. Partially, this reflects the scope of investment
opportunities associated with NBS but also supports Fan and colleague’s (2017) proposal that
NBS are a more responsive form of development that can address the climatic, physical and
socio-economic problems associated with urban development. Thus, NBS are viewed as being
more adaptive to change than traditional investment practices, a view also shared by Eggermont
et al. (2015). Fink (2016) also argues that NBS support a developing equilibrium between people,
technology, the environment and policy to achieve a more sustainable balance of meeting social
needs, supporting ecological systems and economic growth within urban areas. NBS therefore
extend existing ecological thinking to promote stronger links between people and the physical
landscape using ‘nature’ as the conduit for this process. However, Fink (2016) proposes that in
addition to natural resource management that “green technology” in the form of green walls,
roofs and ecologically sensitive buildings, can play a key role in this process as it utilises different
aspects of NBS to deliver benefits.
NBS also sit within wider discussions about the interactions between socio-economic and
ecological systems, and approaches for managing such interactions in a more comprehensive
way. Eggermont et al. (2015) contribute to this conversation, discussing how biodiversity and
human interactions with nature need to be placed at the centre of the current and future urban
development debates. They identify NBS as a continuum of approaches to investment, reflected
by the URBAN GreenUP NBS catalogue, that complement engineered solutions but importantly
promote the use of ecological systems thinking as the basic principle of development. Although
this leads to a more pluralistic approach to development it should also ensure that
environmental considerations become located in all future urban development conservations.
NBS therefore is not separate from water and engineered solutions, but a way of complementing
these practices from a more ecological perspective (Nesshöver et al., 2016). Moreover, van
Wesenbeeck et al. (2014) state that NBS is one of the family of options among a broader range

URBAN GreenUP
GA nº 730426

D1.: NBS Catalogue

206 / 225

of solutions to urban development, not the only one. However, they also discuss how NBS aid
urban adaptation by providing choice for planners, developers and architects within
nature/technology/built infrastructure debates and can be used to reverse some of the cost,
maintenance and delivery issues associated with engineered solutions such as channelization or
hardscaping of urban areas. Consequently, some have suggested that NBS should not be used
to “solve” problems, but to promote greater interactivity between people/nature to support the
development of resilient and sustainable systems (Scott et al., 2016). This, as argued by Connop
et al. (2016), is context driven; and although we can identify practices that can be utilised in
alternative urban and climatic locations, NBS should reflect the physical and socio-economic
needs of a location.

4.2 Politics of investment in NBS: finance, societal use and inclusion of
urban nature in policy
To mainstream the use of NBS in practice requires a transition from academic debate to the
promotion and acceptance by urban and environmental planners to generate broader support
from decision-makers and political leaders. This includes proposals for the inclusion of robust
arguments regarding the economic viability of NBS, their value to society and the business
community, and the role they can play in addressing the key urban issues of the 21st century,
e.g. climate change, biodiversity loss, water management, and human health and well-being.
This requires a leveraging of multiple perspectives linked to the political agenda of a specific
location, which Nesshöver et al. (2016) argue should reflect the complexities and interactions of
social, economic and ecological variables. This ensures the options for NBS investment are
context-specific, and takes advantage of their flexibility as a tool for managing cities in an era of
rapid social and environmental change.
Such times call for significant restructuring of how cities are managed, with Maes & Jacobs
(2017) proposing a set of objectives that urban areas should deliver in terms of the evolving
understanding socio-economic and ecological value associated with NBS and propose the
integration of a comprehensive ecological systems thinking approach to future city
management. Within their discussion NBS are proposed as providing leverage for planners and
environmental advocates to advance truly ‘ecological’ forms of investment. The uptake of such
practices is though predicated on a wider awareness of the fact that NBS can more effectively
deliver economic returns, societal benefits, and ecological solutions in a cost-effective way
(Kabisch et al., 2016). For this to occur there is a need to balance the agendas of diverse
development, environmental and user groups, which requires greater engagement from
decision-makers in the process from the inception to implementation. While transforming the
way cities are managed may be the ultimate goal, we should see successful change as an
incremental increase in the use of NBS to promote an evidence base for the transition from
‘grey’ or engineered solutions to ecologically focussed options (Maes & Jacobs, 2017). Progress
in this areas can, however, be undermined where political agendas are focused on more
traditional solutions, where a lack of reliable (and useable) data exists or where awareness of
alternative investment approaches stifle innovative approaches to solving social and ecological
challenges (Eggermont et al., 2015).

URBAN GreenUP
GA nº 730426

D1.: NBS Catalogue

207 / 225

In addition to greater engagement of stakeholders to facilitate the use of NBS in urban
development, there has also been a significant discussion reflecting the need to communicate
the benefits of NBS effectively to all stakeholders to generate social acceptance for their use. A
substantial proportion of this literature focuses on communicating benefits to gain a social
licence for using NBS, rather than empowerment of communities to drive the NBS agenda.
Within this context Liquete et al. (2016) note that advocates need to be careful in how the
benefits of investment in NBS are communicated, as the links between socio-economic and
ecological value need to be emphasised, especially if there is uncertainty in how NBS can address
existing sustainability issues. In addition, Bennett, Cassin, & Carroll (2016) discuss how the
successful communication of the benefits associated with NBS can help bridge disciplinary and
socio-political gaps in the knowledge of lay people to ensure NBS gain leverage within
policy/practice and public debates. They go on to argue that this does not require a wholesale
shift in thinking from only utilising engineered solutions to solely those that are rooted in nature,
but alternatively facilitates a debate between built environment and nature specialists about
how best to integrate NBS into development and management options. Partly, this reflects the
discussion presented by Raymond et al. (2017), who examine the ways in which NBS have been
developed as a response to changing societal understanding and uses of the landscape. This,
they conclude, established a critical need to rethink how ‘nature’ is valued in urban areas by
experts, politicians and the public. They, like Bennett, Cassin, & Carroll (2016) and Kabisch et al.
(2016) view NBS as a bridge between the positives of engineered forms of urban landscapes, i.e.
its structural integrity, and the nature- sensitive forms of environmental management that
landscape specialists see in NBS.
However, NBS potentially have negative political ramifications. If they are not developed and
managed effectively their ecological systems could fail and the costs of replacement could be
seen as being a prohibitive misuse of public/private funds (Raymond et al., 2017). It can be
argued, however, that even where NBS may not be 100% successfully implemented, they
promote greater equity and access to nature in urban areas by replacing the barriers created by
physical engineered solutions (Scott et al., 2016). Moreover, as GI and public green spaces can
be seen to facilitate multiple uses, access points and activities simultaneously they can be a more
cost-effective way to moderate the exclusionary character of existing infrastructure (Mell,
2016). Furthermore, Vujcic et al. (2017) argue that NBS provide a cost-effective option to
address issues associated with vulnerable populations, such as climate change or flooding
without being too expensive. Thus, NBS can be thought of as providing a basis for a cost effective
co-development of green and grey infrastructure that includes the technical aspects of existing
development practices but which are aligned with more ecologically focussed management
techniques.

4.3 Cost-benefits of NBS compared to grey/built infrastructure
In addition to generating a political acceptance of NBS as an effective way of delivering socioeconomic and ecological benefits across urban areas, there is also a further need to clarify the
added economic value that investments in environmental resources can make. In Fan et al.'s

URBAN GreenUP
GA nº 730426

D1.: NBS Catalogue

208 / 225

(2017) discussion of NBS, they propose that the responsive nature of ecological systems provides
an essential form of landscape protection that is responsive to changes witnessed within the
environmental and built structures of urban areas. This is essential in areas where climate
change mitigation/adaptation needs are becoming increasingly embedded within planning
policy and practice. For Mediterranean countries these discussions are increasingly acute as
drought, heat waves and flash flooding are being witnessed more frequently (Iglesias et al.,
2007). Vujcic et al. (2017) discussed this, outlining how NBS could act to relive stress and mental
fatigue, thus increasing the productiveness of people through interactions with NBS resources.
It is also interesting to note that Bennett, Cassin, & Carroll (2016) considered NBS to be a tradeoff between the production of sustainable urban spaces, the provision of socio-economic
amenities and on-going ecological protection. NBS should therefore be thought of as playing a
several alternatives yet complementary roles in urban management.
NBS can therefore be used as leverage to improve the use of nature in cities by highlighting the
cost reductions in to primary health care, improvements in personal and communal well-being
and energy savings associated with building management systems utilising NBS to mitigate
climate change. The lower cost of implementation and maintenance of NBS can arguably make
them a preferential delivery option compared to traditional forms of grey infrastructure
investment (van Wesenbeeck et al. 2014). This analysis is supported by Keesstra et al. (2018),
who outline how NBS are cheaper to develop, manage and repair compared to traditional forms
of built infrastructure (or more technological interventions), as nature is viewed as being
increasingly adaptive to fluxes in urban and ecological systems (Liquete et al., 2016). Thus, the
explicit focus on natural systems provides an economic competiveness to NBS that is not
witnessed in other forms of investment. This supports the view presented by Pontee et al. (2016)
who argued that NBS are low cost and a ‘no regret’ form of investment, as they can work with
or instead of engineered solutions, and therefore provide options and variability for
planners/decision-makers to work with. Moreover, although NBS can be ecologically or
technologically-based, they should be both cost-effective and innovative (Nesshöver et al.,
2016). Liquete et al. (2016) argued within a similar assessment of NBS that they nurture and
enhance existing opportunities for investment in natural capital, promote jobs and the low
carbon economy, and offer a more sustainable approach to landscape management. This has
helped establish the parameters of NBS within the increasingly monetized urban development
environment, placing nature on a comparable level as other infrastructure, as it becomes seen
as being ‘cost-competitive’. Such a long-term competitiveness is, as Maes & Jacobs (2017)
discuss, essential in promoting economic development security and provides key components
in the transition to a joint socio-economic and ecological approach to benefits and valuation that
can lead to incremental change in policy and practice.

4.4 Management and maintenance issues
Due to the variability of NBS and its implementation, there is a corresponding diversity in how
the resources should and can be managed. NBS has been proposed as an adaptive form of
management to regulate uncertainty and reverse the negative impacts of previous development
(van Wesenbeeck et al. 2014). NBS could enhance the transformative capacity of urban areas to

URBAN GreenUP
GA nº 730426

D1.: NBS Catalogue

209 / 225

mitigate climatic or social variation, but in most places they will likely be embedded within a
portfolio of engineered and alternative ecological management systems, practices and
resources to provide nature-centric solutions at different scales (Nesshöver et al. 2016). Both
groups of authors noted above agree that NBS can help planners and environmental advocates
to respond to uncertainty in urban systems through more adaptive and innovative management
of the natural environment. This is best achieved, Nesshöver et al. (2016) suggest, by using NBS
as part of a nested or integrated approach to management that makes best use of a range of
environmentally focussed development options. This can be achieved if NBS are considered
alongside other landscape solutions, such as GI planning (Liquete et al., 2016), as these concepts
provide a much larger and established evidence base that can be used to situate NBS within a
continually evolving planning system. Therefore, by using NBS in tandem with, for example,
ecosystem services approaches landscape managers can consider both as tools for more
effective management that can be used in conjunction with the proposed outcomes of an
investment simultaneously, enabling maintenance and enhancement of both the quality and
quantity of urban nature (Bennett et al., 2016).
There is also a discussion within the NBS literature that argues for a more integrated approach
to the inclusion of the social elements of urban landscape discussing how an understanding of
society and societal needs is an essential aspect of investment in NBS. This includes the
embedding of local knowledge (consonance), environmental education, and increased
participation in the governance of urban landscapes, as engagement with these aspects of
development provide the context for development, help to ensure the retention of vital ‘synusia’
species and potentially promote a more long-term engagement with environmental issues
(Connop et al., 2016). However, scholars caution against overly optimistic projections of the
future use of NBS or other forms of landscape planning (Mell, 2016), as a shift away from grey
or engineered approaches to NBS engineering may be a long-term process (Raymond et al.,
2017). Thus, if NBS can be positioned as a viable investment option within normative urban
development debates, then a much greater awareness of context-specific issues concerning
appropriate ecologically and socio-economic issues can be embedded within the investment and
management of urban areas. The use of NBS is not though proposed as a panacea for the lack
of integration of environmental knowledge in existing urban development practices.
Alternatively, their use would enable environmental advocates to engage in a dialogue with
decision-makers and, potentially, with a set of investment options that are rigorously evidenced,
economically viable and socio-culturally appropriate.

4.5 Functionality: social and ecological
Whilst creating effective approaches to management and generating political support for NBS
may be a long-term process, there are the beginnings of debate being formed in the research
literature supporting both the functionality and benefits of NBS. NBS are being presented as
delivering what Liquete et al. (2016:392) call ‘smarter systems’, promoting multiple benefits, i.e.
what green infrastructure advocates call multi-functionality, ‘inspired by, supported by or
copied from nature that help societies address a variety of environmental, social and economic
challenges in sustainable’. All of which aids the development of well managed and diverse

URBAN GreenUP
GA nº 730426

D1.: NBS Catalogue

210 / 225

ecosystems that support greater resilience in urban areas. Vujcic et al. (2017) go further and
argue that NBS hold a restorative value in urban management discussions as tools to promote
ecological and socio-economic benefits through a re-established connection of people with
nature. The long-term socio-ecological benefits of this association include improved mental and
physical health and well-being, greater social inclusion and economic prosperity. It also
promotes a better knowledge of NBS and its role in managing urban systems as ‘nature’ is
located within a ‘soft operating space’ in terms of urban development and management (Maes
& Jacobs, 2017). Therefore, through the rehabilitation of landscape resources based on the
increased use and understanding of NBS knowledge of landscape systems and structures can be
embedded more effectively within policy and practice (Keesstra et al., 2018).
Multi-functionality is central to advocating for the use of NBS, as it offers a diverse and
innovative family of approaches to deliver multiple benefits for society and the environment
(Eggermont et al. 2015). Moreover, even where NBS is used to retrofit urban infrastructure they
can still be considered to support the performance of multiple functions and deliver a range of
benefits, to help rebalance previous regimes and problems caused by built infrastructure (Fink,
2016). Where such investment has taken place, i.e. Italy, Serbia and across Mediterranean
climates, we are seeing an increase in societal value placed on nature, indicating that there is a
growing visibility and value being attributed to NBS (Keesstra et al., 2018; Liquete et al., 2016;
Vujcic et al., 2017). This is visible in the evaluations associated with investment in green
infrastructure across Europe related to the Valuing Attractive Landscapes in the Urban Economy
(VALUE), Green SURGE, and TURAS greening projects (South Yorkshire Forest Partnership &
Sheffield City Council, 2012; Hansen et al., 2017; Connop et al., 2013). These projects employed
NBS within constrained urban environments across the Europe Union illustrating the multifunctional benefits that landscape improvements could deliver. This includes the economic
value of green space identified in Belgium, Germany and the UK through VALUE (Mell et al.,
2016; Wilker & Rusche, 2013)and the increased awareness and use of urban greening in Sweden,
Italy, and Portugal (Hansen et al., 2015; Spanò et al., 2015; Spanò et al., 2017). Thorslund et al.
(2017) go further suggesting that with the emerging evidence base the value of NBS is becoming
increasingly visible, which potentially provides scope for a the baseline position of resource
value and policy-making to shift include or focus on NBS. Such impacts have been evidenced for
green infrastructure through the Green SURGE project and are emerging via the Town & Country
Planning Association lead ‘Planning for Environment and Resource efficiency in European Cities
and Towns’ (PERFECT) project where the uptake of urban nature is being debated within policy
and decision-making arenas (https://www.tcpa.org.uk/perfect-project) through a better
understanding of the added-value that nature can bring to urban investment and management.
This reflects greater flexibility that NBS have in urban development, as the use of the concept is
not fixed to historical form of investment (Nesshöver et al., 2016). These assertions are, at this
point, based on scant empirical evidence, but looking to the literature on policy learning and
institutional change is likely to bring more concrete insights into exactly how NBS might be able
to fundamentally change approaches to urban management.

4.6 Types of NBS
As discussed in greater depth in the WP1 Catalogue, NBS can take many forms, each of which
provides a range of social, economic and ecological benefits. Within the broader literature
focussed on green infrastructure, ecosystem services and green management there is a
prominence of categorising what spaces or resources are being debated (cf. Natural England &
Landuse Consultants, 2009). Whilst this provides a set of parameters that managers and
investors can use to frame their discussions of NBS some commentators have stressed it may
not be a necessity for effective management (Mell, 2016; Sinnett et al., 2015). Moreover, any
review of the types of spaces/resources under consideration in NBS debates varies depending
on geographical location, ecological perspective or socio-political approaches to landscape and
urban management (Kabisch et al., 2016). However, to ensure that URBAN GreenUP provides a
robust baseline of NBS it must include a reflection on the types of spaces that are being
considered within the project. WP1 provides a more in-depth discussion of alternative NBS
investments; a review of the literature several key types of NBS can be identified, namely:
1. Water; wetlands; flood prevention; floodplains (Liquete et al., 2016; Maes et al., 2012;
Bennett et al., 2016; Keesstra et al., 2018; Thorslund et al., 2017); storm water
management (Connop et al., 2016); rain gardens (Connop et al., 2016); SUDS (Connop
et al., 2016)
2. Terrestrial resources including forests; sustainable agriculture (Bennett et al., 2016);
soil management (Keesstra et al., 2018); rewilding of urban areas (Keesstra et al.,
2018); meanwhile and untidy spaces (Connop et al., 2016); trees and hedges as health
benefits (Shanahan et al., 2015);
3. Biodiversity and ecologically diverse habitats (Liquete et al., 2016); bio-retention
schemes (Panno et al., 2017);
4. Societal-based values; horticulture therapy; forest schools (Vucjic et al., 2017);
community gardens (Panno et al., 2017); urban regeneration projects (Panno et al.,
2017); decreased UHI (Shanahan et al., 2015);
5. Carbon storage (Maes et al., 2012; Keesstra et al., 2018); biomass storage and
sequestration (Shanahan et al., 2015).
This is not an exhaustive list but highlights the variability of NBS that can be used to address
urban issues through different terrestrial and water-based mediums. It also illustrates that NBS
can be delivered at a number of scales. The WP1 Catalogue provides a more detailed and
rigorous analysis of the types of resources or investments that can be considered NBS.

4.7 Complementing NBS with other green space and ecosystem-based
practices
As discussed previously, NBS is essentially an umbrella term referring to established practices to
provide ecosystem services, the building of natural capital and innovative practices that provide
co-benefits beyond those provided by standard practices in urban planning, such as GI and
ecosystem-based management (Raymond et al. 2017). It is this alignment with familiar
URBAN GreenUP
GA nº 730426

D1.: NBS Catalogue

212 / 225

landscape management practices that has helped NBS gain traction in practice. Furthermore,
the literature notes that NBS is capable of delivering each of the four categories of ecosystem
services: supporting, provisioning, regulating or cultural services, which enables them to link the
ecological and social benefits associated with development. Mindful planning and
implementation will ensure that NBS contributes to service provision in each of these categories,
making them a useful means of providing environmental benefits. At the same time, NBS need
to be understood as a tool that reaches beyond ecosystem service approaches because they
have the potential to provide co-benefits (e.g. socio-cultural, economic, governance) (Raymond
et al. 2017).
Much of the literature on NBS discusses what they can offer above and beyond more familiar
ecosystem service approaches. For example, Pontee et al. (2016) identify a range of fully natural
and hybrid approaches to NBS in coastal areas, demonstrating that they are often cheaper than
standard engineering approaches in providing ecosystem services. This view is supported by
Raymond et al. (2017), who propose that NBS provide scope for planners and other nature
advocates to move beyond simple discussions of ecosystem services to integrate a more holistic,
cost-effective and adaptive form of management in urban areas. Even where they have slightly
higher construction costs, such solutions can deliver a much wider range of ecosystem service
benefits, although findings of this nature should be generalised with caution, as the wide
variability of NBS interventions and diversity of implementation contexts mean costs versus
benefits will differ significantly across different areas (Pontee et al. 2016). Other authors, such
as Scott et al. (2016), suggest that NBS are a way of operationalising an ecosystem services
approach within spatial planning, arguing that the added value of NBS is that they can integrate
ecological concerns alongside traditional planning concerns, and in so doing more effectively
mitigate human impacts, break down sectoral and spatial barriers in planning, and provide a
more comprehensive way to deliver benefits in urban areas. Most authors highlight the
ecological dimension of NBS as a pathway to achieving co-benefits for society, and stress that
socio-economic and governance dimensions require more focused attention in planning and
delivery if NBS are to deliver benefits in these areas.
Meanwhile, other authors argue for highlighting the socio-economic benefits first and foremost,
such as Lafortezza & Chen (2016), who frame NBS as a human-centred approach. They argue
that NBS can be focussed on ecosystem services but centred on key services provided to people,
particularly human health and well-being, to enable advocates to successfully shape public
policy. Such an approach could offer longer-term benefits for urban planning. A number of
authors including (Maes & Jacobs, 2017) argue this as a way of promoting NBS to facilitate a
transition from the use of natural resources without reflection on their socio-economic values
to a more explicit reflection on the environmental values that can be embedded within
development. Extending this argument NBS can be postulated as a bridge between the
increasing understanding of the provisioning, supporting, regulating or cultural services
provided by nature and existing built environment practices. Thus, NBS offer planners a
portfolio of investment options that can help renature, support and diversify the resource base
of an urban area without harming its productivity or value of a landscape using NBS (Bennett et
al., 2016).

URBAN GreenUP
GA nº 730426

D1.: NBS Catalogue

213 / 225

The fact that NBS should be inspired by, and supported by nature means that they can be a more
effective and efficient means of addressing urban challenges. Ideally NBS will be biologically
productive and self-organising, thus they can be a more cost effective way of enhancing
ecosystem services than GI or hard engineering approaches (Panno et al., 2017). This efficiency
is explicitly built into the definition of NBS for Maes and Jacob (2017), who define NBS as way of
operationalising ecosystem service approaches specifically with decreased input of nonrenewable resources and increased investment in renewable natural processes. By investing in
renewable natural processes, NBS can not only be more economically sustainable over the
longer term, but can also be a more efficient way of providing benefits. The proposed ecological
and socio-economic benefits are, thus, more readily quantifiable than for other approaches to
managing urban challenges (Thorslund et al. 2017). A clear demonstration of the wide range of
benefits provided by NBS is provided by Connop et al. (2016), who outlines a biodiversity-led
approach to urban greening that attends to governance and policy aspects, delivering extensive
co-benefits beyond increasing species richness in green space. Their approach attends to both
social and environmental needs, and in so doing provides a demonstration of how NBS can offer
added value above and beyond traditional GI projects. This includes building urban resilience
and adaptive capacity in formal and informal sectors, enhancing policy and scientific learning,
overcoming negative public perceptions, and quantifying both costs and benefits. They suggest
adopting a social-ecological systems-based approach is integral to the success of NBS if it is to
embed a more robust form of ecological knowledge and social needs within policy than is typical
for other green space planning approaches.

4.8 Scale of NBS investment
Scale is a significant aspect of the value of NBS. Although a substantial proportion of the research
focussed on NBS concentrates on smaller interventions, they have untapped potential as a
landscape-scale management tool, as they draw on ecological systems thinking. The potential
for scaled investment is discussed by Fan et al. (2017) who argue that multi-scale NBS offer
additional options for nature to be used within and across urban areas and boundaries. Within
this discuss there are clear links between the framing of NBS and the principles outlined by
Hellmund & Smith (2006) and Firehock (2015) and reflects one of the most prominent
arguments found in the greenways and green infrastructure literature, which argues for a multiscale approach to investment and management (cf. Austin, 2014; Benedict & McMahon, 2006).
In both literatures, ecological and socio-economic benefits are attached to the linking of
resources across landscape and political boundaries, as they then provide accessible and
connective resources that promote interaction and use, for example in Atlanta or Stockholm
(Andersson et al., 2014; Mell, 2016). In addition, the promotion of a systems approach to
landscape management requires planners to understand the ways in which biodiversity, water
systems and urban movement shape the use of the landscape (Ahern, 1995; Niemelä, 2014).
The diversity of NBS available to planners and NBS advocates provides greater scope for the
assessment of a wide range of investment alternatives that can address significant urban
challenges and wide-ranging benefits in urban areas, enhancing accessibility and equitably
distributing solutions across an urban area. Eggermont et al. (2015) support this view proposing

URBAN GreenUP
GA nº 730426

D1.: NBS Catalogue

214 / 225

that although NBS provide planners with a suite of investment options that can be used to adapt
urban areas to the ‘wicked’ challenges associated with climate change, whilst they can also be
extremely effective at dealing with local environmental issues. Raymond et al. (2017) emphasise
the need to implement NBS at multiple scales to upscale the evidence collected from the
relatively small-scale (i.e. localised) interventions that have been advocated for to date in NBS
conversations. The development of a multi-scalar approach and successful upscaling, they note,
will require the creation of a corresponding scientific evidence base that illustrates the links
between NBS interventions and the potential socio-economic and ecological benefits they can
deliver.
However, there is a need to reflect upon the implicit challenges of implementing NBS as the
scale of intervention increases. The creation of multi-actor partnerships is therefore essential as
they support, in many locations, a more collaborative process of governance linked to
stakeholder engagement that enable them to address challenging implementation issues
(Meerow & Newell, 2017; Ryan et al., 2002). While scale should always be aligned with the
nature of the urban challenge, large-scale interventions are particularly important as they
support broader spatial needs of different ecosystems. For example, Thorslund et al. (2017)
argue that the large-scale nature of many environmental challenges, e.g. climate change, land
use change, affect landscape scale water management, and lead to calls for large-scale
interventions if we are to restore hydrological function and water balance. This view is also
proposed in the research of Hellmund & Smith (2006) who examine the role greenways can play
in establishing an equilibrium between the protection of environmental systems, the economic
cost of management, and the needs of human populations to access natural areas outside of
city boundaries. While scientific understanding needs to occur at multiple scales, these authors
argue that for important ecological features, large-scale understanding and interventions are
essential.
Scale mismatches are, however, common in environmental management, and NBS are no
different. Thus, if NBS are to effectively address urban challenges, they need to be implemented
at the right scale. Similarly, within the broader discussions proposed by Kabisch et al. (2016) and
Eggermont et al. (2015) there is a discussion focussing on the relevance of the ‘right’ scale for
investment in NBS. They examine how working at the appropriate scale is essential if a NBS
resource it is to remain functional, and propose that NBS interventions should include
knowledge of wider systems thinking, as well as a local understanding of nature to ensure
complementarity between approaches. This is reflective of the IUCN literature which discusses
how biodiversity and climate change are predominately concerned with a better understanding
of the interaction of ecological and built environment systems (Cohen-Shacham et al., 2016).
Strategies to address scale mismatches will require an interdisciplinary, systems thinking
approach that considers the specific features of the urban challenges to be addressed and
feasible options for their resolution. A diagnostic approach to designing NBS interventions,
where scale is explicitly considered (c.f. Rijke et al., 2012), can help support a suitably scaled
approach to investment in urban nature.

The concept of a ‘cascade’ is a useful way of understanding the relationship between scale of
intervention and outcomes in NBS investment. This is captured in the ecosystem services
cascade framework developed by Maes et al. (2012), wherein they demonstrate the link
between ecosystem services and human health and well-being through a cascading set of
spatially explicit processes. Such an approach points to the value of viewing NBS investment as
a cascade, with investment in ecosystem services at larger scales having effects not only at that
scale, but all the way down to very local scales, e.g. investment in water quality at a basin-wide
scale results in a reduction of local treatment costs and improved health at local scales. Their
approach provides a more consistent methodological framework for deciding the spatial
distribution of costs and benefits and evaluating the effectiveness of NBS, thus providing a
useable tool and knowledge base for making decisions about the ‘right’ scale of intervention.
Other authors have discussed this cascade, but Keesstra et al. (2018) discuss it in the sense that
an individual NBS is unlikely to solve significant challenges like land degradation, but that a
cascade of different NBSs at different scales has the potential to address such challenges, build
resilience of entire ecosystems, and help countries meet sustainable development goals. While
most scale discussions focus on the spatial dimension of ecological systems and human impacts,
Xing, Jones, & Donnison (2017) discuss scale in a different way, proposing ways that NBS can be
retro-fitted into indoor and outdoor urban design, integrating them from the building scale to
the meso-city scale. While they highlight the value of small-scale investments, they argue that
such interventions are often ineffective for dealing with the main challenges such as water
management, climate change, biodiversity loss, and food production unless combined with
other NBS. Green roofs, for example, can effectively deal with rainfall events if implemented
across a catchment, but they are unlikely to make a significant impact on water management
issues unless combined with other NBS (Xing et al., 2017). Such literature highlights that, while
NBS are flexible and scalable, scale matters if they are to provide a measurable impact on the
key challenges faced in by urban areas (Benton-Short & Short, 2008; Goode, 2014; Lachmund,
2013).

4.9 Policy environment for NBS
Finally, there is a need to consider the pace at which the policy environment for NBS is changing.
With the support of the European Commission and the Horizon 2020 programme NBS are
gaining both visibility and traction within policy across the EU. Some authors, such as Fink (2016),
have argued that NBS enhance ecosystem services, but also support growing environmental
awareness support greener cities and a more environmentally conscious public. This, they
suggest, helps to cultivate a greater sense of stewardship and potentially lead to behavioural
change. In this sense, Fink views policy as a ‘context destabiliser’ which provides a window of
opportunity to disrupt conventional, ‘business as usual’ practices, meaning that NBS can lead to
bigger policy changes once a crucial threshold (which varies depending on the intervention) is
met. The potentially disruptive nature of NBS, and the requirement that interventions be
implemented through multi-stakeholder partnerships has led to additional discussions of
responsibility for stakeholders to establish who has rights to the landscape, and who should be
managing it (Connop et al., 2016; Faehnle et al., 2014). The impetus for implementing NBS in a

URBAN GreenUP
GA nº 730426

D1.: NBS Catalogue

216 / 225

democratic, collaborative way is bolstered by the arguments of Scott et al. (2016), who argue
that NBS should be considered as a public good and one that should be included in urban policy.
These authors illustrate how the governance changes required to support NBS can help cities
overcome existing silo thinking that act as barriers to effectively addressing urban challenges.
The outcome of which is a reduction in vulnerability, e.g. to extreme climate events, increasing
urban resilience, and the promotion of socio-ecological multi-functionality and interactivity
between people and landscape resources (Beatley, 2000; Ugolini et al., 2015). All of which are
key policy mandates in many European cities (European Commission, 2015).
To help facilitate the establishment of NBS within policy there is a need for it to be linked with
existing data sets, analysis and practices to ensure that NBS (and other green space management
practices) are seen to both complement and extend existing practices (Fan et al., 2017; Meerow
& Newell, 2017). However, although we may be witnessing a growing catalogue of NBS projects
producing evidence of its socio-economic and ecological benefits there remains a slower pace
of change in policy emphasis utilising NBS within national and sub-national policy across the EU
(Nesshöver et al., 2016). NBS can, and are though being promoted as a catalyst for investment
in some countries such as the UK, Germany and Spain, where investment in urban nature is
being linked directly with economic development agendas (Raymond et al., 2017; Vujcic et al.,
2017). This process is dependent on an understanding of the benefits of NBS and their inclusion
within policy, which continues to vary between locations due to sovereign approaches to land
use planning across the European Union (Shwatrz et al., 2014). Thus, an understanding of the
existing resources base, geographical differences in the planning policy/practice frameworks
(and families), and the scale of interventions being proposed are all important characteristics to
consider when attempting to embedded NBS into policy. Raymond et al. (2017) explore this
process indicating the need for an effective and appropriate governance framework to be in
place to support NBS if they are to be delivered and managed effectively. They argue that in
such situations that the benefits that NBS can deliver through innovative design and investment
are understood and can be related to existing planning systems.

4.10 Policy learning
If NBSs are to be embedded into policy, planning and management practice, they will need to
be accepted not only as new tools, but as a useful perspective and viable pathway for resolving
urban challenges. Here there is a great deal of insight to be gained from the policy and
institutional literature, particularly that on institutional change and policy learning. To date,
much of the policy focussed on NBS has developed through instrumental policy leaning based
on experimentation, analysis and reporting (Challies et al., 2017). In many locations, the uptake
of NBS thinking has followed the advocacy generated from green space planning, i.e. in
Germany, and more recently from green infrastructure planning in many other parts of Europe
(Cohen-Shacham et al., 2016; Vujcic et al., 2017). This has followed the normative approach to
policy formation based on testing, evidence generation, and consultation with key stakeholders.
While this has linked the NBS evidence base to decision making in partnerships between policymakers, environmental experts and academics (Kabisch et al., 2016), this type of learning seldom

URBAN GreenUP
GA nº 730426

D1.: NBS Catalogue

217 / 225

leads to the systemic learning required to mainstream the use of NBS. In the literature, this type
of instrumental learning (i.e. learning new facts and perspectives) is most common in policy
implementation and planning practice, but it seldom leads to the substantive changes required
to deal with challenging social, economic, and environmental issues (cf. Argyris 1993; Pahl-Wostl
et al., 2010; Suškevičs et al., 2017). The instrumental learning that has characterised NBS
practice to date is known as ‘single-loop’ learning, but for complex and intractable urban
environmental, social, and economic challenges, there is a need to question underlying
assumptions of existing policies, programmes, organisations, and practices. This often requires
re-evaluation of the philosophy and rationale (e.g. theories of cause and effect) that underpin
existing practices. This is known as ‘double-loop’ learning, which involves reframing the
problem, re-thinking goals and interests, and even applying different values (Innes and Booher,
2016). ‘Triple-loop’ learning goes one step further, and occurs when current assumptions no
longer appear to hold. This type of learning is transformative, and it is generally the type
required for the significant challenges that face urban areas, like climate change (Gupta 2016).
Policy learning of this type is social, as it requires learning not just at an individual level but also
across different groups and organisations involved in managing urban areas.
Mainstreaming the use of NBS requires attention to the conditions that support learning and
policy change, but thus far the NBS literature has not sufficiently engaged with these bodies of
literature. There are many strategies that could inform approaches in both leader and follower
cities in URBAN GreenUP and the Horizon 2020 programme more broadly. Several of those
conditions are part of the projects already. This includes feedback (e.g. monitoring post
intervention) and systems understanding (e.g. baseline monitoring), which are known to be
critical facilitators of learning are already occurring. However, self-reflection on (and revision of)
management approaches, policies, plans and – perhaps most importantly - underpinning
philosophies post-intervention is a critical element for learning neglected in typical project
management processes (Clement et al. 2016a). One of the distinct differences between NBS and
other approaches to greening cities is that it is problem-oriented, and this orientation is known
to more effectively foster learning than more general goal-orientated approaches (Ansell, 2011).
Still, the scale of the problems NBS address, both in terms of spatial scale and temporal scales,
presents a significant challenge for mainstreaming their use. For example, there is a mismatch
between the timescales involved in understanding ecological systems and learning how to solve
environmental challenges, yet social and political timescales are more relevant for establishing
expectations for what can be achieved. This is one reason that evidence for the efficacy of NBS
will never, by itself, lead to their widespread use.
Also relevant is the strong bias towards habit and maintaining the status quo in institutions,
which needs to be overcome to integrate new approaches into management and planning,
including the innovative use of NBS. Pilot studies demonstrating innovations, as in projects like
URBAN GreenUP, can illustrate the added value (economically, socially and ecologically) of
investing in NBS. Izmir, Liverpool and Valladolid can be thought of as urban laboratories where
NBS experiments are being undertaken, monitored and evaluated to inform further forms of
policy (and development). This sort of intentional experimental testing in diverse environments
is known to support learning (Clement et al. 2016b), but achieving longer-term change based on

URBAN GreenUP
GA nº 730426

D1.: NBS Catalogue

218 / 225

this learning in both leading and follower cities requires focused strategies. As noted throughout
this paper, NBSs have the advantage of complementing existing approaches, which can make
incremental change in the use of NBS within the cities more likely, but achieving larger scale
changes across urban areas will require reorienting city governance in a new direction (Clement
et al. 2015).
There are a number of practical strategies that are known to facilitate this, including working
with “institutional entrepreneurs”. This term refers to individuals, organisations, and their
networks that recognise when dominant approaches are not working, and are skilled in the art
of achieving change within the constraints of existing institutions (Mintrom and Norman, 2009;
Clement et al., 2016a). This form of entrepreneurship is different to that required in business,
with a such entrepreneurs needing to be skilled in particular strategies relating to advocacy,
discourse, vesting, constructing identities, changing normative associations, constructing
shadow networks outside of formal institutions, timing, mimicry, theorising, and educating
(Lawrence et al. 2009). This literature is extensive, but looking at it more deeply could help city
managers better understand some of the essential (but often neglected) strategies for
mainstreaming NBS. Strategies range from the overtly political (advocacy) to subtly introducing
change by aligning it with existing practice (mimicry). Identifying skilled institutional
entrepreneurs can be challenging because, in most cases, they are not “leaders” in the
traditional sense, yet they provide an important form of leadership that can change habits and
standard practices within organisations. These types of changes are known to support largerscale transformations in policy and practice (Ansell 2011; Clement et al., 2015), thus the work of
such entrepreneurs behind the scenes is often more important than that of visible political and
organisational leaders for achieving the sort of stable, widespread change that can normalise
the use of NBS.

4.11 Summary

NBS is an increasingly popular approach for addressing environmental, social, and economic
challenges in urban areas, and one where Europe has been leading the way in terms of defining
and implementing such interventions (Eggermont et al., 2015). As a result, the EU’s definition of
NBS has been widely adopted, and provides a shared understanding and robust basis for what
NBS are. Beyond this, there is still debate in the literature about where NBS sit alongside other
approaches to urban and environmental planning and management (Kabisch et al., 2016). There
is general agreement within the academic, policy-making and practitioner literature that NBS
provide ecosystem services, but whether they are an extension of ecosystem service approaches
or merely a means to operationalise the concept is still a point of discussion (Cohen-Shacham et
al., 2016). Most authors promote NBS as an innovative suite of approaches that are
complementary to more conventional ‘hard’ engineered approaches, as well as more traditional
greening approaches like GI and ecosystem-based management. A key point of difference is
that NBS should be focused on solving urban problems and not just ‘greening’ cities delivering
ecosystem services and a range of co-benefits for society, the economy, and governance systems
(Panno et al., 2017). There is a great deal of potential for NBS to solve local challenges (e.g.
localised flooding) as well as contribute to addressing bigger global challenges (e.g. climate
change), but NBS interventions need to be at the appropriate scale and tailored to local contexts.

In most situations, a cascade of NBS approaches, from very small interventions like a green roof
to major projects like re-naturing a river, are required to effectively address urban challenges
(Thorslund et al., 2017).
The use of NBS may be politically challenging to achieve up front, but the literature on policy
learning, participatory governance, and adaptive governance all offer insights into how to
mainstream NBS and change the ‘business as usual’ approach to landscape and urban planning.
While the cost of NBS can seem daunting in a time of government austerity, the fact that NBS
almost require, by definition, multi-stakeholder partnerships, make them more resilient to
government financial circumstances than wholly public-funded interventions (Raymond et al.,
2017). Moreover, NBS is usually more cost-effective than hard engineering approaches in the
long run, mainly due to lower maintenance costs when NBS are designed to be self-sustaining.
The balance between costs and benefits favours NBS because they provide a wider range of
benefits for ecological, economic and social systems. The diversity and flexibility of NBS is also a
positive, making them a more effective choice for building adaptive capacity and resilience,
reducing vulnerability, and providing tailored solutions that incorporate both scientific evidence
and community needs.
