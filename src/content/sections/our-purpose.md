#🌿 **Our Philosophy**
Cities are living bodies. When they ache, we can heal them — not with massive, disruptive projects, but with subtle, vital needlepoints of green. This is the art of *urban acupuncture*: reconnecting humans and nature through micro-interventions that ripple outward. Every planter, pocket garden, and restored patch of soil helps transform cities from cold, hard infrastructure into more liveable places, driving regeneration for both people and biodiversity.

#🌱 **Our Mission**
We bring nature back into the city. By combining data, design, and community power, we transform overlooked urban spaces into living, resilient ecosystems. Through small, precise interventions, we regenerate the city fabric, strengthen resilience to climate change, and create healthier, more liveable environments for people and biodiversity alike.
