We identify where nature is needed most. Using open data and community insights, we map the city’s challenges — from heat and flooding to air pollution and lack of green space — and reveal the places where small interventions can make the biggest impact. Through our tools, Explorer and Sightings, we highlight both the gaps and the existing grassroots efforts already shaping the city. By connecting local makers, builders, and community groups, we help turn strategic opportunities into real, on-the-ground microinterventions that bring nature back into Bristol’s hardest-hit areas.
