### Key Features

**Community Sightings Map**
Help us map our city's biome! Add your own sightings of interesting sites directly to the map. This could be a great nature-based solution, a problem area, or a space with untapped potential. See what others have found and contribute to our collective understanding of the urban landscape.

**Identify Greening Opportunities with NDVI**
The app includes live Sentinel-2 satellite data, processed to visualise the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). This powerful tool helps us identify areas that lack green space and target interventions where they are most needed.
