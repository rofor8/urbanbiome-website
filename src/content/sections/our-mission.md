We bring nature back into the city through *urban acupuncture* — by introducing green microinterventions in strategic places that heal urban spaces. By combining data, design, and community power, we transform overlooked areas into living ecosystems. Using open GIS data and satellite imagery, we identify where nature can have the greatest impact, then work with communities to create a network of sustainable, low-cost green solutions that restore biodiversity and strengthen climate resilience.
