    <h3>Greenery & Nature-based Solutions (NbS)</h3>
    <p>Nature-based Solutions (NbS) leverage the power of nature to address urban challenges like climate change, biodiversity loss, and human well-being. They involve protecting, restoring, and sustainably managing ecosystems to provide ecological, social, and economic benefits.</p>
    <p>Our research focuses on identifying and promoting effective NbS such as urban green spaces, green roofs, sustainable drainage systems (SuDS), and urban forests. These solutions can improve air and water quality, reduce urban heat island effects, enhance biodiversity, and create more resilient and livable cities. We cite reputable sources and studies to back our findings and recommendations.</p>
