### ðŸŒ± Our Mission

We bring nature back into the city. By combining data, design, and community power, we transform overlooked urban spaces into living, resilient ecosystems. Through small, precise interventions, we regenerate the city fabric, strengthen resilience to climate change, and create healthier, more liveable environments for people and biodiversity alike.

### ðŸŒ¿ Our Philosophy

Cities are living bodies. When they ache, we can heal them â€” not with massive, disruptive projects, but with subtle, vital needlepoints of green. This is the art of urban acupuncture: reconnecting humans and nature through micro-interventions that ripple outward. Every planter, pocket garden, and restored patch of soil helps transform cities from cold, hard infrastructure into more liveable places, driving regeneration for both people and biodiversity.

### ðŸŽ¯ Our Objectives

#### Data-Driven Impact

Map the cityâ€™s pain points with open GIS data to target where nature can heal most.

#### Sustainable Design

Create low-cost, low-impact solutions that last and empower people to act.

#### Community Engagement

Bring people together to co-create shared green spaces.

#### Urban Regeneration

Restore biodiversity and natural processes at the heart of the city. test
