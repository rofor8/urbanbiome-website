The planet is overheating and we are in a climate emergency. In 2019 the UK declared national climate emergency. Since then a number of actions flourished across the country with a focus on decarbonisation. But actions to adapt and regenerate our urban environment are still hard to implement. 

Humans have a deep, instinctual need to connect with the natural world. Modern city life, for all its advantages, can often sever this connection, leaving us in environments that feel functional but not truly nourishing. Our philosophy is simple: we believe the best urban spaces are those that honor this innate need for nature.

Our mission is to weave these timeless, natural elements back into the city fabric, transforming the urban landscape into a supportive habitat. We strive to improve cities by integrating nature, applying permaculture thinking, and leveraging data to create sustainable, resilient urban ecosystems.
