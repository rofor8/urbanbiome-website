We bring nature back into the city through urban acupuncture â€” small, precise interventions that heal urban spaces. By combining data, design, and community power, we transform overlooked areas into living ecosystems. Using open GIS data and satellite imagery, we identify where nature can have the greatest impact, then work with communities to create sustainable, low-cost green solutions that restore biodiversity and strengthen climate resilience.
