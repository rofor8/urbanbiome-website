navTitle: "Our Mission"

Global warming is under way and extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and intense across the world. 
In 2019 the UK declared national climate emergency. Since then a number of actions flourished across the country with a focus on decarbonisation. But actions to adapt and regenerate our urban environment are too slow to be implemented.  

Humans have a deep, instinctual need to connect with the natural world. Modern city life, for all its advantages, can often sever this connection, leaving us in environments that feel functional but not nourishing. 
Our philosophy is simple: we need to reconnect human beings with nature through applying the principles of urban acupuncture and urban greening.  

Our mission is to weave these timeless, natural elements back into the city fabric, transforming the urban landscape into a supportive habitat. We aim to improve our cities by integrating nature, applying permaculture thinking, and leveraging data to create sustainable, resilient urban ecosystems.
