### ðŸŒ± Our Mission
We bring nature back into the city. By combining data, design, and community power, we transform overlooked urban spaces into living, resilient ecosystems. Through small, precise interventions, we regenerate the city fabric and make it a supportive habitat for both people and biodiversity.

### ðŸŒ¿ Our Philosophy
Cities are living bodies. When they ache, we can heal them â€” not with massive, disruptive projects, but with subtle, vital needlepoints of green. This is the art of 'urban acupuncture': reconnecting humans and nature through micro-interventions that ripple outward. Every planter, pocket garden, and restored patch of soil is a step towards cities that are not just functional, but nourishing, biodiverse, and alive.

### Our objectives

#### Urban Regeneration
Fostering biodiversity and restoring natural processes in urban settings.

#### Community Engagement
Collaborating with local communities to create shared green spaces.

#### Sustainable Design
Implementing long-lasting, low-impact and low cost solutions that will support local habitats and biodiversity, enhance social cohesion and empower individuals to act. 

#### Data-Driven Impact
Utilizing Open GIS data to identify and prioritize areas for ecological improvement.
